27,KEY,"A quiet day was due in the stock market Tuesday after three sessions in a row of strong gains.The Nasdaq was flat going into the final hour, while the S&P 500 added 0.3%. Blue chips showed more life as the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.5%. The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.7% after touching an all-time high earlier in the session.Volume crept higher on the NYSE but slipped on the Nasdaq.The Dow's outperformance was somewhat misleading. The Dow is a price-weighted index, which can distort results. Boeing (BA) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) are the two heaviest weightings in the Dow, and they advanced confidently Tuesday. Boeing rose 1.5%, while UnitedHealth gained 1%.In the S&P 500, PepsiCo (PEP) surged about 4% as it retook its 200-day line in fast trade. The 50-day line was reclaimed in June.Pepsi's earnings popped 7%, topping views by about 6%.

34,KEY,"Dow futures rose modestly Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts. The Nasdaq composite is just below last month's record high, while the S&P 500 index is just below a four-month best, near a handle-like formation. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday.There are some quality stocks working on buy points. Marathon Oil (MRO) and EOG Resources (EOG) are among the many energy stocks closing in on breakouts. Trendy apparel and handbag retailer Michael Kors (KORS) — along with Dollar General (DG) and Home Depot (HD) — is also in sight of an entry area. But none of these top stocks cleared buy points in Monday's stock market trading.Cactus (WHD) stock shot up 4.5% to 35.60 on Monday, clearing a 35.28 cup-with-handle buy point. But the maker of wellhead and pressure-control equipment tumbled late on plans for a follow-on offering. Cactus came public at 19 a share in early February.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseInstead, Monday was for laggards. The day's top-performing groups tended to be ranked near the bottom of the 197 industries tracked by IBD, with few in the top quartile. The Dow Jones industrial average, up 1.3%, outpaced the 0.9% gains for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite.Within the Dow Jones, the big winners were Caterpillar, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, up 4.1%, 3.1% and 2.7% respectively. But Caterpillar stock is still below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. So are JPMorgan stock and Goldman stock, after both hit 2018 lows last week.Huya stock, a recent spinoff from YY (YY), shot up 18% Monday. Meanwhile, iQiyi stock, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, rebounded more than 6%. Bilibili (BILI), another recent China livestreaming IPO, popped 4%. Huya is the only one that has turned profitable.All three stocks were big winners in May and much of June, but then sold off sharply. Perhaps Huya, iQiyi and Bilibili will consolidate and form new bases and buy points. But they have a lot work to do.Dow futures rose 0.3% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures popped 0.4%.

76,KEY,"Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) led four top stocks pulling back to their 50-day moving averages on Friday. A strong rebound from that key technical level can offer a chance to add shares to your position. But with the Nasdaq composite and other leading stock market averages tumbling Monday on trade war fears, Apple stock and Nvidia stock plunged below that key support level. Nvidia also sold off below its buy point. Financial stocks E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and SVB Financial (SIVB), well extended from their last buy zones, also undercut their 50-day lines.XWhile Apple stock is clearly the most popular name in the group, it lags with a Composite Rating of 84 out of 99. E-Trade leads the group with a 99, and is closely followed by SVB with a 98 and Nvidia with a 97. Top stocks typically have strong Composite Ratings when they launch big moves.When looking for stocks to buy, in addition to strong technical action, it's important to look for top fundamentals. The Composite Rating combines factors such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and price performance.Apple stock is back below a three-weeks-tight buy point of 190.47 as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. Shares are back in buy range from a double-bottom entry at 179.04, closing Friday at 184.92. Apple stock fell 1.5% to 182.17 in Monday's stock market trading, below its 50-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA 10-week-line pullback represents an add-on buying opportunity when the moving average is above a buy point. However, you want to ensure that the stock is finding support at this level, rather than losing it. You also want to buy as close as you can to a rebound off the line is sound strategy.It's key to remember that a rebound off the 10-week line represents a chance to add shares to an existing position, rather than initiate a new one.A stock falling through its 50-day line, especially in high volume, is not good action. Investors should examine their portfolios and consider sell rules.As for investors on the sidelines, look to see if these stocks rebound by the end of the week. A brief foray below the 50-day line, by itself, is OK. But you should wait for a strong rebound.Nvidia stock was 5% from a double-bottom entry at 239.35 on Friday even as it pulled back toward its 10-week line. But keep in mind that Nvidia's base is later stage whereas Apple's double-bottom is an early-stage base. Later-stage bases can work, but they have a higher chance of failing since they form after a stock has already been on a big run.Nvidia tumbled 4.7% to 239.12 on Monday, knifing below its 50-day line and the 239.35 entry in above-average volume. The stock has now roundtripped a 12% gain from the buy point, a strong sell signal.E-Trade stock is finding support at the 10-week line after trading in a relatively tight range over the past several weeks. Shares closed Friday 16% extended from a late-stage consolidation first cleared on March 9.This represents the stock's first pullback to the 10-day line above the buy point. Investors can add shares to their positions at the first two pullbacks, but after that — without the formation of a new base — the stock would be considered too extended.E-Trade stock fell 3.4% Monday, below its 50-day line.Lastly, SVB Financial stock is pulling back to its 10-week line too.

108,KEY,"Dow futures led modest gains ahead of Thursday's open as the stock market and Tesla (TSLA) faced several key tests. Premarket action pointed to a narrowly positive open, shot through with some dramatic moves — both up and down.Late earnings reports on Wednesday led new-issue Zscaler (ZS) and dollar-store Five Below (FIVE), both trading near buy points, to spike in after-hours trade. Recreational and specialty vehicle plays Thor Industries (THO) and Rev Group (REVG) suffered harsh losses.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average firmed to a 0.3% gain. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded 0.2% above fair value.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWith no significant economic news expected through the rest of the week, markets are beginning to look toward next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Fed fund futures currently project a 94% probability that the meeting will produce a target rate hike.  How markets will behave ahead of the meeting is a less certain bet, but the market faces several key challenges for Thursday's session.1. Will the Dow hold the 25,000 level? The index first cleared the 25,000 mark in January, then slipped back below it in its huge Feb. 5 dive. The mark holds little technical significance, but could bolster the market's mood and set sights on retaking the Dow's January record high.2. Will the Nasdaq and S&P 500 extend their rally to a fifth day? The S&P 500 ended Wednesday 1% below its 2801 high of March 13. That marker is still well below the index's late-January peak, but retaking the psychologically important level would bode well for the market's status. The hurdle is within striking distance on Thursday.3. Will Tesla hold on to its massive 9.7% gain from Wednesday, the stock's largest move since November 2015? Chief Executive Elon Musk spurred the move at the company shareholder meeting on Wednesday, saying Model 3 production would ""quite likely"" hit 3,000 vehicles a week by the end of June. The maker of luxury battery-powered vehicles has a history of missing its self-imposed targets, a trait reflected in the stock's tentative action over the past year.Zscaler surged 10.8% in Wednesday's extended trade following its fiscal third-quarter report. The security software play narrowed its loss to 2 cents, vs. expectations for an 8-cent loss. Revenue powered up a much-better-than-forecast 50%. Zscaler has soared nearly 17% since the start of June, to 92% above its March IPO price. The stock closed Wednesday in a buy range above a 30.20 buy point in a double-bottom base. The stock's after-hours move implied it would open beyond buy range on Thursday. Moves made in extended trade do not always carry over into the regular session.IBD Leaderboard stock Five Below rocketed 10.8% after Wednesday's close as first-quarter revenue and earnings topped consensus views. Same-store sales came in a bit lighter than expected, but management boosted its Q2 revenue and earnings guidance well above consensus targets. The dollar store's shares were up 13.9% for the week on Wednesday, and nearing the top of a buy range from a flat-base buy point at 78.38.Rev Group, the already beaten-down maker of ambulances and school buses, bombed more than 14% after its fiscal Q2 revenue and earnings missed expectations. The stock ended Wednesday 46% below its January high.Leading trailer and motor-home brand Thor Industries reeled more than 6% lower. Fiscal third-quarter revenue just met analyst targets, but earnings growth stopped short. The company said industry outlook is strong and labor costs had moderated, but it cited raw-material price increases ""due in large part to the headwinds created by the announcement and implementation of the steel and aluminum tariffs and other regulatory actions, as well as higher warranty costs."" Thor shares closed 38% below their January peak.Oil prices were steady after taking a dive on Wednesday. West Texas intermediate dropped 1.2% to settle back below $65 per barrel. Energy Information Administration data showed a surprise 2.1 million barrel increase in weekly oil supplies.Prices are likely to remain in flux ahead of the June 22 meeting at which the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners including Russia will discuss whether and how much to ease current production caps. Oil prices are tacking toward a third straight weekly decline — the first three-week downtrend since September last year.Weekly jobless claims are the only notable economic data due out Thursday.

114,KEY,"Americans' long-running joke about a Starbucks (SBUX) on every corner may be nearing its end.The coffee behemoth is retrenching in its home market as it contends with sales growth that Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson acknowledges isn't fast enough. The cafe chain said Tuesday it expects comparable sales to rise just 1% globally for the current quarter—the worst performance in about nine years. That's well below the 2.9% analysts were expecting, according to Consensus Metrix.Starbucks also plans to close about 150 company-operated stores in densely penetrated U.S. markets next fiscal year, three times the number it historically shuts down annually.""Our growth has slowed a bit,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""I expect better, I think our shareholders deserve better, and we're committed to address that.""At the same time, the company appears headed for a tough quarter in China, with comparable sales flat or slightly negative in the current period, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said in a presentation. China remains a key market for Starbucks, with the chain betting that revenue there will triple over the next five years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlthough business abroad has been booming and the chain has been opening more and more cafes, U.S. sales growth has stalled for the company that brought espresso to the masses. With about 14,000 stores domestically, Starbucks is now pumping the brakes on licensed and company-operated locations, with a renewed focus on rural and suburban areas—not over-caffeinated urban neighborhoods where locals already joke that the next Starbucks will open inside an existing store.The closing stores are often in ""major metro areas where increases in wage and occupancy and other regulatory requirements"" are making them unprofitable, Johnson said. ""Now, in a lot of ways, it's middle America and the South that presents an opportunity.""For the ubiquitous chain, moving slower and shutting unprofitable stores may trigger some deja vu. In 2008, longtime leader Howard Schultz returned to the company that was struggling after expanding too quickly across the U.S., giving competitors like McDonald's (MCD) a chance to elbow back into breakfast. Investors cheered as Schultz retook the helm and closed some underperforming stores, and share prices at the chain have been up eight of the last 10 years. So far this year through Tuesday's close, shares have been essentially flat.But now, with Schultz stepping back from his beloved company, the task of the righting the ship will fall to Johnson, who took over as a CEO just over a year ago. Schultz, who had already transitioned away from running the coffee chain's day-to-day operations, announced earlier this month he'd be leaving the company, fueling speculation he could be gearing up for a political career. Veteran retailing executive Myron Ullman is taking over as the new head of the board as Schultz departs.While Schultz had been trying to expand the Seattle company's premium business, dubbed Reserve, along with Italian bakery Princi, analysts have speculated that these may be put on the back burner under the new leadership. The company is also facing a resurgent McDonald's, which has been advertising $2 cold-brew coffees, along with other steep discounts from fast-food rivals.""The competitive environment has really become a lot stronger in the U.S. and a lot of that is the fast-food chains really improving the quality and breadth of their offerings in terms of hot beverages and breakfast,"" said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus. Americans can ""get that same flavor profile at a much lower price somewhere else. That becomes an area of concern for Starbucks.""Starbucks has also faced backlash this spring after two black men were arrested at one of its stores in Philadelphia while waiting for a meeting to begin. The company and Johnson apologized, calling the arrests ""reprehensible."" Last month, Starbucks closed about 8,000 cafes so its employees could undergo racial-bias training, which did hurt sales in the quarter, Johnson said. After stores reopened following the May 29 training, sales have started to rebound at U.S. locations, with the chain expecting domestic same-store sales growth of around 3% in June, according to the company.The company now expects to report adjusted earnings of between $2.39 and $2.43 per share this fiscal year, down from an earlier forecast of $2.48 to $2.53, according to an investor presentation.""The competitive environment has really become a lot stronger in the U.S.""Starbucks says it can attract more diners in the U.S. with new menu items and will focus on its expanding tea business, as well as capitalizing on health and wellness trends. Starbucks just added a new mango-dragon fruit iced drink to its permanent menu in the U.S. and Canada. And it's focused on improving its food lineup with sous vide egg bites, plus a new line of lunch salads and sandwiches that it's expanding across the nation.""We're putting more of our energy into that afternoon day part and the portfolio of beverages that are offsetting some of the declines we're seeing in Frappuccino beverages,"" Johnson said, citing a consumer shift away from sugary drinks. The company is also preparing to ""lean into more plant-based beverages,"" he said, noting that a new plant-based protein cold-brew drink will be introduced this summer.The chain is also relying on its digital initiatives to contribute between 1 and 2% to comparable sales next fiscal year. There's going to be a new way for non-rewards customers to earn stars and rewards starting next spring, allowing visitors to cash in on loyalty without fully signing up.On Tuesday, Starbucks said that it will return more cash to shareholders—about $25 billion in buybacks and dividends through fiscal 2020, representing a $10 billion increase from the previous guidance. Additionally, it plans to cut general and administrative costs, and has hired a consultant to help in this area. It's also exploring options to license some company-operated stores ""in other appropriate markets,"" it said.The company earlier this year said the cash it got from a licensing deal with Nestle SA would go to support the company's growth in the U.S. and China, where its expansion has been explosive. Starbucks plans to more than triple revenue in China in the next five years and open a new store every 15 hours through 2022 in that market. Johnson confirmed Tuesday that China may one day be a larger market for Starbucks than the U.S.""The China market still offers a lot of potential,"" Bartashus said. ""But the current political environment with trade wars looming or the governments picking at each other—it definitely casts a shadow over the long-term prospects for large western brands that are in China.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

126,KEY,"Illegal Immigration: The latest outrage by the Trump administration is its policy of ""ripping"" children away from parents who've crossed the border illegally. As with so many other things involving Trump, there's plenty of emotion but precious little in the way of facts.The furor reached critical mass after the Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that 1,995 children had been separated from their illegal border crossing parents from mid-April through May. That number included, DHS said, cases where the adults were arrested for illegal entry, immigration violations, or possible criminal conduct.The practice has generated a rising storm of protests, including from Republicans, ever since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the administration's ""zero tolerance"" for illegal border crossers. Laura Bush took to the Washington Post's op-ed page to decry it as ""cruel"" and ""immoral."" Trump supporter Franklin Graham called it ""disgraceful.""Trump himself says he doesn't want to see families separated while the legal process works its way out, and then went on to blame Democrats for the problem.So what's going on here?First, it's important to note that many of the ""separations"" don't last long at all.As Rich Lowry explains in a detailed article in National Review, ""when a migrant is prosecuted for illegal entry, he or she is taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals,"" in which case, as when other adults are incarcerated in the U.S., they are separated from their children.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLowry notes that ""The criminal proceedings are exceptionally short, assuming there is no aggravating factor such as a prior illegal entry or another crime. Migrants generally plead guilty, and then are sentenced to time served, typically all in the same day.""The Los Angeles Times reports that Rio Grande Valley border agents prosecuted 568 adults and separated 1,174 children since the administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy in early April. However, it only took a matter of hours to reunite more than a third of these children with their parents.That hardly constitutes an inhumane policy of ""ripping"" children away from their parents.Most of the concern about family separations centers on the administration's handling of asylum seekers who've crossed the border illegally.In the past, the practice has been to simply detain these families for a short time in an ICE facility. But rather than return for their asylum hearing, many just disappeared into the country.Under the ""zero tolerance"" policy, Trump has tried to put an end to this ""catch and release"" policy, by arresting every adult caught illegally crossing the border.If parents choose to seek asylum, they can end up separated from their children for months while the asylum process plays out.The administration is right to point out, however, that there is a legal process for seeking asylum that won't involve facing such a choice — just show up at a port of entry to make the asylum claim.""As I have said many times before, if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted over the weekend.Critics complain that the legal process just takes too long, as a way to justify illegal border crossings. But illegal border crossers are not only jumping the line. Under the old system they could vastly increase their chances of staying in the country — with or without gaining asylum status.Is it wrong for Trump to try to close this unfair and potentially dangerous loophole?Another fact conveniently overlooked amid all the hysteria is that just because a group claims to be a family, doesn't mean it's true. The Department of Homeland Security says that from October 2017 to February 2018 it saw ""a 315% increase in the number of cases with minors fraudulently posing as 'family units' to gain entry.""Presumably that's because they think posing as a family will improve their chances of avoiding deportation. Whatever the reason, those children's separation from their parents occurred long before the border patrol showed up.To be sure, the administration's bungling response to the outcry over its policies has made it harder to understand, much less defend, what's going on.But those protesting family separations should at least acknowledge that there are reforms available that don't involve returning to the days of ""catch and release,"" while still keeping families together — which is the ideal solution — such as letting children stay in detention centers for more than 20 days, and boosting funds for family shelters at the border.Getting such reforms done in today's massively polarized environment, however, is unlikely. The question is, who's to blame for that?Lost Children? Detention Cages? Baby Prison Bus?

President Donald Trump is set to OK tariffs on $50 billion in China goods, with reports that he's close to finalizing duties on a further $100 billion in Chinese products. China said it will respond ""instantly."" A trade war could hit big U.S. multinationals such as Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL) Deere (DE). Meanwhile, Adobe Systems (ADBE) fell early Friday despite beating views and raising guidance.President Trump is going ahead with tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, with reports saying the list of affected products is smaller and more focused on tech. An official announcement likely wil come Friday, though it's not clear when the tariffs will go into effect. China has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs, matching the U.S. dollar for dollar.All that was largely expected, but Reuters reported that Trump is close to finalizing tariffs on a further $100 billion in Chinese goods. Not only would that ratchet up the trade war and spur further retaliation, but the U.S. duties themselves could affect American companies. Keep in mind that the Apple iPhone and many other products and components are made in China but for U.S. companies.China is a huge market for Boeing jets and Caterpillar construction equipment. Farm equipment giant Deere is at risk from reduced China purchases of soybeans and other U.S. agricultural products.Apple fell 0.4% to just above 190 before the open on the stock market today. Apple stock is modestly extended from a 179.04 double-bottom breakout in early May, but is threatening to undercut a three-weeks-tight pattern entry of 190.47.Boeing retreated 0.7% and Caterpillar lost 0.8%.

137,KEY,"Growth stocks with connections to China, e-commerce, consumer spending and technology had a cheery session in stocks today as the Nasdaq composite rallied more than 0.8% and boosted into new high ground for a third straight session.Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed high-growth companies Netflix (NFLX), Etsy (ETSY) and Qualys (QLYS) symbolized an ongoing trend in 2018: institutional investors continue to hunt for innovative companies that are delivering strong increases in earnings and sales. In a bull market, excellent fundamentals often beget excellent stock market performance.While the Nasdaq 100 shot 1% higher to a new high, the S&P 500 rose slightly less than 0.3%. Dairy, department store and specialty retail, superregional bank, wood product, oil drilling and farm machinery firms dropped significantly.

Friday will see monthly and weekly options expire, which sometimes results in unusually heavy volume.A day after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the second time this year, institutions jumped back into the U.S. Treasury bond market, buying with fury. On the long end, the benchmark 10-year yield fell 4 basis points to 2.94%.Meanwhile, the ECB signaled that it's ready to curtail its own form of quantitative easing and initiate a hike in interest rates sometime in the summer of 2019.French and German equities rallied sharply earlier in the day. The CAC 40 gained 1.4%; Germany's DAX 100 advanced 1.7%.Netflix, one of those rare growth stocks able to lead the upside in more than one secular bull run, jumped another 3% on Thursday and reached a new session high of 395.03.At that price, Netflix has scored a 27% profit for those who bought shares at a prime follow-on entry point near 311 during the final week of April. The gain triggered a key sell signal in which one should take many gains at 20% to 25% from a breakout point.Selling winners on the way up frees up cash in the portfolio for future new buys. Also, many great stocks will take a pause and correct significantly in price after they break out and notch strong double-digit gains.Why was the 311 price level a valid buy point for Netflix?After its breakout from a three-month cup without handle at 204.48 in early January this year, Netflix rallied valiantly, then tested buying support at the 10-week moving average for several weeks during the market's second intermediate correction that began in late March.After a solid breakout from a base, the first and second pullbacks to the 10-week moving average (as seen on a weekly chart) or the 50-day moving average (on a daily chart) can offer a secondary buy opportunity.The online video streaming giant and pioneer joined IBD Leaderboard initially in July 2014.Etsy vaulted more than 26% to 41.65 in huge volume and at one point rallied 35% intraday. At 41.65, the online marketplace for artists and small businesses has climbed more than 40% since rebounding off the 50-day moving average in late May.The Brooklyn-based company announced an increase in transaction fees for sellers.The Street expects Etsy, also an IBD Leaderboard stock, to grow earnings in the second quarter by 150% to 5 cents a share.Qualys, a security software play, jumped more than 6% to 94.80 in quadruple usual turnover.

138,KEY,"Key index funds fell in the stock market today after the Federal Reserve hiked its key interest rate and signaled two more rate hikes this year.That weighed on the Dow industrials, sending SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) down 0.4% Wednesday. The ETF has been shaping a flat base with a potential buy point at 266.03. The biggest losers included Verizon Communications (VZ), Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), which fell a respective 2.9%, 1.8% and 1.8%.Only seven of the Dow's 30 stocks bucked the decline.

Meanwhile, Momo (MOMO), a China streaming stock veteran, has also been rallying in recent weeks.The streaming service, still majority owned by Baidu (BIDU), is riding the wave of popularity for online movies and live media in China. U.S. investors have showered love on this wave of new and recent streaming companies, with iQiyi stock doubling in value in under three months.IQiyi made its IPO on March 29 at 18 and bolted to a new high of 35.95 in today's stock market action. But shares have pulled back to 1-cent gain at 34.52. Rapid trading with no price advance indicates a stalling day. Along with iQiyi stock's huge advance and being well-extended from the 10-day moving average, that action suggests a short-term pullback is likely.That could give investors a reason to book some profits.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

173,KEY,"The IBD 50's gains over the past 24 months could make any professional fund manager or individual investor salivate.On a price-weighted basis, the index has climbed more than 74% since late June of 2016. And the S&P 500? The large-cap benchmark has risen about 32%, excluding cash dividends. Some companies featured in the IBD 50 have gone up a lot more.The market never guarantees that past performance will repeat. So as we head into the second half of the year, don't think too much about the quantity of profits you might reap. Instead, focus on the quality of price-and-volume action by the stocks that interest you.Before a stock even attempts a new breakout and surpasses the proper buy point, examine how well it's actually formed the base. Know the price at which you might have to bail.Gauge how volatile the stock trades in price, week to week. Does a stock candidate trade like Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), which can go up or down 5% to 10% in any single week? If yes, then make sure you can stomach such big moves.The biotech group member formed a pair of bases after it hit a then-record peak of 50.05 in September. The first base — from September to January — showed poor quality. Most of it formed underneath the 10-week moving average. Another flaw? The relative strength line did not reach new high ground as Supernus rallied past a 43.35 buy point in its double-bottom base.Here's another chart-reading tip. Count the number of weeks within the base in which a stock ends the week up in heavy volume. Then count the down weeks in above-average turnover. If the former exceeds the latter, the more likely that institutions are showing net demand.There are exceptions.Before Viper Energy Partners (VNOM) cleared a 26.29 buy point in a nine-week cup base, the stock logged one up week in heavy volume and one down week in charged-up trade: No net accumulation. But the base showed lots of tight weekly price closes. Ditto for PGT Innovations (PGTI) in its latest flat-base structure.If a stock falls for the week in heavy turnover, but it closed in the upper half or upper 60% of the price range, don't count it as a bad sell-off week. Such action may actually be positive. Why? Funds stepped in during the sell-off to grab shares and support the stock price.Let's look at the two latest bases that Canada Goose (GOOS) formed. The apparel maker peaked at 24.32 in June 2017. It then crafted a 21-week cup with handle. That base showed five up weeks in big turnover, and just one down week in heavy trade. Volume was huge when Canada Goose fell 10% in the week ended June 30, 2017. But a secondary offering of shares caused the huge boost.Never chase a hot stock. One can never know when the top names in the IBD 50 or other growth stock screens suddenly begin a serious correction.Wall Street veterans say the market discounts the future. In 2018, it's weighed the risks of a potential military flare-up on the Korean Peninsula; the move by long-term interest rates past 3%; the strength in crude oil; the escalation in tariffs on imports among the U.S., China, Canada, Mexico and Europe; and a government investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections.What else could pop up?Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at $117 billion asset manager Payden & Rygel, is keeping a sharp eye on one measure of inflation, the median increase in the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), as calculated by the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank. Cleveland says the 2.7% year-over-year increase in median CPI is the highest in the current economic growth cycle that began in June of 2009.""People say to us, 'Inflation is up, but it's only energy.' But we think it's more than oil,"" Cleveland told IBD in an interview. ""We think there's more room for inflation expectations to rise, and it could lead to higher Treasury bond yields."" Higher yields can make bonds more attractive vs. equities.RELATED:How To Beat The Major Indexes: Do You Employ This Portfolio Technique?Inside IBD Big Cap 20What Should A Good Cup With Handle Look Like?

The airline said it is weighing how to adjust its capacity plans.XThe carrier, in presentation materials for the Deutsche Bank Global Industrials and Materials Summit, said it expects Q2 EPS of $1.65-$1.75, down from its forecast in April for $1.80-$2.00 and below the Wall Street consensus for $1.89.Delta said market fuel prices had surged some 50% year over year. Since the beginning of the quarter, prices had climbed around 12%, it said.The carrier also tightened its Q2 unit revenue forecast and now sees an increase of 4%-5% vs. the 3%-5% range offered in April, when Delta reported Q1 earnings. Unit revenue gauges an airline's efficiency by measuring sales in relation to its available seats and flights.Shares of Delta Air Lines skidded 0.9% to close at 54.17 on the stock market today.

The decision, Delta said, would be made ""through the lens of strong demand and volatile fuel.""Southwest on Monday cut its flight-capacity growth for this year. Some analysts anticipated that decision amid rising fuel prices. American Airlines also said passengers could face higher ticket prices if oil prices remain elevated. Fuel and labor typically make up an airline's biggest costs.Delta on Wednesday said it expects Q2 nonfuel unit costs to rise around 3%, at the higher end of its expectations in April for a 1%-3% increase. But the airline continues to see a 2% rise for the full year, partly through upgauging its aircraft fleet.The carrier said it was ""focused on recapturing fuel through revenue.""

235,KEY,"Dow Jones futures rose Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, after the stock market averages reversed lower Wednesday. The chip sector, which usually is a key part of stock market rallies, is quietly tumbling. Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU) and Nvidia (NVDA) stock breakouts have failed, while Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO) and many others never got to a buy zone.On Wednesday, the major stock market averages initially rallied as President Donald Trump softened his stance on China investment restrictions. But the Nasdaq composite reversed lower, closing down 1.5% to just above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index sank 0.9%, settling below its 50-day line for the first time since May 8. The Dow Jones retreated 0.7% after reclaiming its 200-day line intraday.The stock market rally, already under pressure, is in more distress now.Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.3%.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index tumbled 2.5% to below its 200-day line. Except for a few days two months ago, the Philly Sox chip index hasn't been below that level in two years.Intel stock has fallen 15% from its June 4 peak. On June 18, the world's largest chipmaker fell below a messy flat-base buy point and the 50-day line. Intel stock has kept falling.Nvidia stock had cleared a flattish double-bottom buy point of 239.25 on May 4, reclaiming its 50-day as well. Shares of the graphics chipmaker rallied to 269.20 on June 14, but then began retreating. By June 25, Nvidia had fallen below its 50-day and round-tripped a double-digit gain to close below its buy point.Micron Technology ran up in the right side of a cup base in late May on earnings guidance and buyback news, briefly topping a buy point but never closing above it. Micron stock then tried to form a high handle formation, but has fallen back despite strong earnings and guidance last week. This week, Micron stock has tumbled below its 50-day line.Taiwan Semiconductor stock, the world's largest chip foundry, hit its worst levels since last August. Broadcom stock, a notable Apple (AAPL) iPhone chipmaker, has been struggling for the past seven months.Semiconductors tend to take part in any significant stock market uptrend. So if Intel stock, Micron stock and other chips are struggling, it's hard for the broader market to move forward. The Philly Sox index hit a short-term peak on June 7, below their March 13 record high, a few days before the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones began topping out.Why do they matter? Chip stocks account for a big share of stock market capitalization, especially in the Nasdaq. But they're also used in so many products, from the Apple iPhone to servers to under the hood of your car. So if chip stocks are struggling, it's a bad sign for many end products as well.Energy groups accounted for the five top-performing industries Wednesday out of the 197 that IBD tracks.

244,KEY,"The major trade news this week is President Trump's decision whether to hit China with new tariffs starting Friday. Those headlines — about whether the Trump tariffs aimed at China are on or off — will be huge for the stock market.If they're on, then the U.S. will be at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing from which there may be no turning back. If they're off, then Wall Street will heave a sigh of relief, knowing that Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.The stock market rally is under pressure, largely due to Trump trade war fears. The S&P 500 index rose solidly Thursday, reclaiming its 50-day moving average. The Dow Jones rallied to just above its 200-day line.Yet a weightier headline for the future of world trade and U.S. economic leadership already hit on Sunday: ""World's Biggest Trading Bloc a Step Closer After Tokyo Meeting."" China took another step toward forming a 16-nation trade zone with Japan and India, covering one-third of the world economy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChina is moving into the vacuum left after Trump's rejection of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership forged by President Obama to ensure lasting U.S. influence in the Far East.""As protectionism concerns increase globally, it's important that the Asian region flies the flag of free trade,"" Japanese trade minister Hiroshige Seko said at a news conference, playing up potential for a year-end agreement.Instead of major U.S. trading partners uniting against China, the U.S. is drawing fire from all sides for Trump tariffs. China is widely seen as the prime culprit in global steel overcapacity that spurred Trump's 25% steel tariff. Yet China has been a minor steel exporter to the U.S., so Trump picked a fight with Japan, the EU, Mexico and Canada.While Japan remains wary of China, Trump's metal tariffs and abandonment of the TPP have Tokyo focused on tighter links with Beijing.This spring, Trump briefly toyed with rejoining the TPP, having scrapped the deal four days after taking office. That was a clear signal Trump follows his gut instincts at the cost of any strategic approach to trade policy.Trump is trying to use America's big trade deficit as leverage to secure an easy trade-war win. But any win against China will be short term and do little to narrow its $375 billion trade surplus with the U.S. and alter its systematic push to gain access to the intellectual property of U.S. firms.Before negotiations hit a wall, Trump largely declared victory in late May, when China offered to boost U.S. purchases by $70 billion. Trump touted the emerging deal as a big win for American farmers. The loser wouldn't be China, but other countries that supply it.No question, stocks will rally if such a deal reemerges to avert a China trade war.

265,KEY,"The China trade war may be about to get better, not worse. Despite Wednesday's sell-off as the Trump administration identified $200 billion worth of potential targets for future Trump tariffs, the key moment is about to arrive that could see the ice break in the brewing technological cold war between the U.S. and China.Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE saw shares soar on Thursday as the U.S. agreed to let the company resume doing business with American suppliers, pending the receipt of a $400 million escrow payment.Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that both the U.S. and China are prepared to resume stalled trade negotiations.The confluence of events is likely no coincidence. President Trump's commitment to lift sanctions that amounted to a death sentence for ZTE seemed to break a logjam in U.S.-China trade negotiations back in May. Soon after, Trump touted a prospective trade deal with Beijing, tweeting that  ""China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products"" and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the China trade war had been put ""on hold"" amid progress in negotiations.Those negotiations stalled as Congress complicated Trump's pledge via tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" The Senate preserved the ban on doing business with ZTE in the national defense authorization bill, but those harsh terms may not be included in the final version expected to pass in late July.The stock market reaction on Wednesday came as the threat of escalating Trump tariffs became more tangible, though the likelihood of tariffs hadn't changed. In June, President Trump directed the Office of the Trade Representative to come up with a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that could face 10% tariffs, and trade officials produced that list late Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, the market downdraft on Wednesday was fairly modest. Wall Street still seems to be betting that this round of Trump tariffs will never take flight and that China won't escalate its retaliation against U.S. multinationals. We'll probably know whether Wall Street is right within the next several weeks, as the White House prepares to impose the new tariffs by Aug. 30.As long as Congress hews to Trump's wishes and drops the Senate provision mandating a ban on U.S. firms doing business with the Chinese communications equipment firm, U.S.-China trade negotiations could quickly resume and begin to demonstrate progress.Beijing refuses to negotiate under duress, so there is still a risk the China trade war will escalate with more rounds of Trump tariffs. But a U.S. reprieve for ZTE and its 75,000 global employees may allow Xi to resume negotiations without losing face, despite the Trump tariffs already in place.Yet if ZTE gets a new lease on life and there isn't a nearly immediate thaw in the China trade war and threats of more Trump tariffs continue to fly, look out.This may be the last off-ramp before a full-scale trade war that threatens to seriously damage business prospects for U.S. multinationals in China and severely disrupt technology supply chains.The U.S. imported $506 billion in Chinese goods last year, meaning about half of Chinese imports would be affected by Trump's latest tariff threat.As Trump threatens a full-scale China trade war, Beijing vows to meet the U.S, blow for blow.While Chinese targets are somewhat limited by its $130 billion in American imports, Beijing has other ways to retaliate, and that's one of Wall Street's big fears.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks like Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL) via regulations.China's government also could hit Boeing sales, and likely Caterpillar, through its state-owned enterprises that can sway the market. Meanwhile, Beijing has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The way things are going, there's little reason to expect China to blink in the face of Trump threats. BMW said this week that it will shift some SUV production from South Carolina to China in the face of Trump tariffs. Meanwhile, China's currency is losing ground vs. the dollar, counteracting the impact of Trump's threatened 10% tariffs on a wide range of consumer goods.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Falls As Trump Threatens New Tariffs; Netflix Holds UpChip Equipment Stocks Get Price-Target Cuts On Market SlowdownThe Big Picture: Stocks Now Test These Critical LevelsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

266,KEY,"China stocks Baozun (BZUN) and Momo (MOMO), both IBD Sector Leaders, are holding above a key technical level after finding support. The moves could represent opportunities to add on shares. Baozun stock jumped 4.3% to 57.81 Monday while Momo stock pared most of its gains and rose 0.5% to 46.65.Baozun and Momo are top China stocks in the fast-growing internet segment that each earn an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. That means their shares outperform 98% of stocks in the market based on key fundamental and technical factors. Those factors include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.China internet stocks were some of the top performers in June. But as stock market indexes came under pressure in the latter part of the month, so did China stocks. But pullbacks aren't necessarily bad, as they can lead to buying opportunities.Baozun stock is looking to close at its highest level in eight sessions, and to retaking the 50-day line Monday after hovering around that level for about two weeks of trade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen a stock rebounds higher after finding support at the 50-day line, that could be a chance to add shares to a position. With add-on buy points, you want to buy as close to the 50-day line as possible to prevent from buying an extended stock.This represents Baozun's first pullback to the 50-day line, or 10-week line on a weekly chart, since the China stock's earnings fueled a breakout past a 52.43 buy point.The first two pullbacks to the 50-day line after a breakout are seen as good opportunities to add shares to an existing position, as long as the line is above the buy point.But Baozun stock plunged below the 50-day line in above-average turnover on June 27, closing below the buy point. That may have prompted some investors to exit their positions.That's why it's a good idea to take at least partial profits when a stock becomes 20% to 25% extended from a buy point. Baozun reached that level in its third week after the breakout.Meanwhile, Momo is holding above its 50-day line after rebounding from that level Friday. While Momo stock pared all its gains Monday after rising as much as 4.4% early in the session, volume isn't massive. If the stock was falling hard in heavy volume after rising that much, that would be very bearish.The cup-half-full investor would note that Momo battled back to break even after losing as much as 0.9% midway through the session.The chart for Momo stock looks similar to that of Baozun. Shares gapped up, past a buy point, after earnings and then ran up more than 30%. Then it pulled back to the 50-day line. But unlike Baozun, Momo never round-tripped its gains.As this is the first pullback to the 50-day for Momo after a breakout, it could qualify as an add-on opportunity as well.Momo's June-quarter earnings are projected to accelerate from 57% to 77% as revenue growth slows from 64% to 54%. Accelerating earnings growth is bullish. While the top-line growth is seen slowing, a 54% jump still represents strong growth.Meanwhile, Baozun is expected to see earnings growth slow from 29% to 17% on a sequential basis. Revenue growth is estimated to decelerate slightly from 25% to 21%.In addition to looking at stocks with strong technical action, it's important to focus on stocks that have good fundamentals. Internet stocks Momo and Baozun are benefiting from China's ever-increasing web consumption.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHow To Stay In Step With The Market Using Psychological Indicators, Analysis

273,KEY,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy. The decisions followed a year-long ""deep dive"" by new CEO John Flannery, a period over which GE stock crumbled in half. Analysts warned of another dividend cut, the second since both the payout and earnings outlook were sliced last year. GE stock rebounded after falling to multiyear lows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNike profit grew 15% to 69 cents a share on 13% revenue growth to $9.79 billion, easily quashing analyst views for 64 cents EPS and $9.39 billion in sales. North America sales rose 3%, bucking three straight quarters of year-over-year declines. The world's largest athletic apparel brand also announced a $15 billion share buyback program. Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles. That plan helped send shares of UPS down 2.3% and FedEx 1.3% on Thursday.The Federal Reserve released the second and final round of its annual stress tests, clearing most shareholder payout plans for the nation's largest financial firms. Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion. Several IPOs showed double-digit gains on the first day of trading. Among biotech new issues, Neuronetics (STIM) rallied 63% in its debut and Tricida (TCDA) rose 37%. The largest IPO was BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ), which raised $637.5 million, as shares rose 29% on the first day. Furniture retailer Lovesac (LOVE) jumped 50% on its first day of trading.Canadian marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) reported its first quarterly earnings as a U.S.-listed company. Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS. Shares retreated.Lennar (LEN) stock popped after it demolished earnings estimates on Tuesday, though the largest U.S. homebuilder fell back later in the week. Meanwhile KB Home (KBH) rose Friday after the builder scored a double beat late Thursday.Carnival (CCL) shares sank to their lowest level in more than a year after the cruise line pared its full-year EPS outlook from $4.20-$4.40 to $4.15-4.25. Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents. The drugstore company also topped earnings views and guided modestly higher. Same-store sales fell though. Shares plunged to their lowest level in three years on Amazon's deal to buy PillPack.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) cut its revenue guidance on currency headwinds but raised its EPS outlook on greater-than-expected operating efficiencies.Accenture (ACN) delivered a fiscal third-quarter earnings beat.

285,KEY,"SAN FRANCISCO — A top SEC official said Thursday that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities, adding that a key point in deciding whether a coin is a security is whether a cryptocurrency network is sufficiently decentralized.XNot being securities means transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum aren't subject to SEC rules.""(When) purchasers no longer have expectation of managerial stewardship from a third party, a coin is not a security,"" said William Hinman, the head of the SEC's division of corporate finance, at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto.However this also means that initial coin offerings, which have in the past been launched by centralized teams, could fall under SEC rules.This is because initial investors could be buying coins in the belief they can profit when they go public and increase in value. In addition, at such an early stage they are not sufficiently decentralized.Bitcoin, which has been falling in recent days, was up 5.5% at $6,645.48 late Thursday, according to Coindesk. Ethereum jumped 9.1% to $519.51. Among Bitcoin-related stocks, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) rose 3.9% on the stock market today, Overstock.com (OSTK) gained 3.3%, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) added 2.5%, and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied 9.25%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe SEC had indicated in the past that Bitcoin was not a security, but this was the first time an official has said the same about Ethereum, whose status was in question after it was launched by a core group of creators.""Putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions,"" Hinman said.He also said applying the disclosure regime of federal securities laws to current transactions in Ethereum ""would seem to add little value.""Meanwhile, TruStory founder and CEO Preethi Kasireddy, whose young company uses tokens to incentivize users to uncover ICO scams, thinks the SEC has made the correct decision.However, she said there will be more trouble in the future, as she believes the SEC will have a ""hard time figuring out what's a security and what's not.""And she predicted cryptocurrency prices have much further to fall, and the drops so far this year are ""minor"" compared to what is to come.""I thought correction would be a lot more,"" she said. ""I think there'll be an even bigger correction.""Legal experts at the event welcomed the SEC's clarification. Grant Fondo, who chairs the digital currency and blockchain practice at the Goodwin Procter law firm, said it will help him structure potential token sales.He also believes more clarification will help America become more competitive in the cryptocurrency space.""I do think now more token sales (will) stay in the United States,"" he said. But ""it's a long way to see how it plays out. In the last six months there has been a big push offshore; hopefully this will help people come home.""However, it still remains an open question whether cryptocurrencies are actually good investments.Venture capital giant Keith Rabois, who is known for startup investments and his executive roles at the likes of PayPal (PYPL) and Microsoft's (MSFT) LinkedIn, said there are ""no clear use cases at the moment.""The Kholsa Ventures managing director also said it is difficult to pick the best digital currency just now, when it is still unknown which has either a clear use or the best underlying technology.He added that it has been clear for a ""very long time"" that large swathes of ICOs have been violating U.S. securities laws.But Baiju Bhatt, co-CEO of the Robinhood investment app, said he believes that in the future cryptocurrencies will be an ""awesome store of value,"" though he said it is too early to pick a winner.""Don't believe the hype, pay attention to the details. There is going to be a lot of good that comes out of this,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

303,KEY,"Crude rose to the highest in more than a week Monday as cracks in a key pipeline threatened Nigerian oil exports and a schism deepened within OPEC over whether to allow more oil to flow onto global markets.Futures advanced 0.6% in New York. New leaks have been discovered in a Nigerian pipeline that's been shut since late last week and the operator provided no estimate for when deliveries will resume. Meanwhile, Iraq joined Iran and Venezuela in panning Saudi Arabian suggestions that it's time to unwind output caps.The Nigerian outage involves ""a big pipe, big delivery point,"" said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. At the same time, any signals that major producers like the Saudis are boosting output are ""going to tend to weigh on the market.""The self-discipline of the OPEC-led coalition that adopted historic supply restraints in early 2017 may already be slipping. Russia lifted crude output 140,000 barrels a day above its cap in the first week of June, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Saudi Arabia raised production last month to the highest since October, according to a person familiar with the kingdom's disclosures to the cartel.Russia and the Saudi kingdom have signaled they may formally propose a gradual production increase when OPEC and allies gather in Vienna on June 22-23.Yet, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said OPEC and allied producers haven't reached their objectives and shouldn't be influenced by calls to pump more oil.West Texas intermediate crude for July delivery climbed 36 cents to settle at $66.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 24% below the 100-day average.Brent futures for August settlement ended the session unchanged at $76.46 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, and traded at a $10.43 premium to WTI for the same month.In the U.S., stockpiles stored at the pipeline complex in Cushing, Okla., fell by an estimated 900,000 barrels last week, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.

335,KEY,"Stocks rose in a holiday-shortened week, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 finding support at key levels. President Donald Trump triggered a China trade war while China took aim at Micron (MU). Tesla (TSLA) finally achieved a Model 3 production goal, but the stock tumbled. So did Macau-centric casino giants such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS). Biogen (BIIB) soared on a promising Alzheimer's treatment. Crude oil futures topped $75 but then pulled back.The Dow Jones undercut its 200-day moving average on Tuesday, the S&P 500 index sank below its 50-day line while the Nasdaq composite tested its 50-day as China trade war fears grew. But, even with President Trump going ahead with China tariffs Friday and Beijing retaliating, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher for the week. Tesla and casino giants were big losers. Micron tumbled as a Chinese court barred some sales in the country.The electric-car maker managed to top a long-delayed production goal of 5,000 Model 3 sedans in the final week of June. But Tesla skipped a brake test to make the deadline. Overall Q2 vehicle deliveries missed estimates. Tesla bears cited those points in doubting the electric-vehicle maker can maintain and expand its end-of-June pace. Tesla stock popped Monday morning on the Model 3 news but reversed to close lower, then continued to tumble, losing 10% for the week.General Motors (GM) grew new vehicle sales 5% in the second quarter, while Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Toyota Motor (TM), Honda Motor (HMC) and Nissan (NSANY) all topped estimates for U.S. auto sales in June. A strong June capped stronger-than-expected industrywide sales in the first half of 2018, as SUVs and trucks continue to boom. A solid labor market has kept buyers in the car market, despite rising gas prices and interest rates. The annualized pace of new vehicle sales reached 17.5 million in June after dipping to 16.9 million in May, according to Autodata.Auto stocks are struggling as Trump threatens global auto tariffs, raising supply costs, and they're likely to spur retaliation. There were reports of U.S.-Germany talks to eliminate tariffs. But China slapped new duties on U.S.-made cars Friday following Trump's decision to impose tariffs on high-tech China goods.Biogen (BIIB) and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase II tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease. The drug now known as BAN2401 slowed progression of Alzheimer's in 856 patients with mild dementia over a period of 18 months. Drugmakers have struggled to find treatments for the crippling disease, with many failures along the way. But the potential benefit to a drugmaker and patients is huge. Biogen stock skyrocketed Friday.Micron Technology (MU) says a Chinese court ruled against the memory-chip maker in a patent-infringement case without giving it a chance to present its defense. The injunction covers certain DRAM modules and solid-state drives, representing slightly more than 1% of Micron's annualized revenue. Micron stock tumbled 5.5% on Tuesday, while investors saw the court ruling as part of China's retaliation to Trump tariff threats. Shares rose modestly Thursday.Dell will go public as part of a $21.7 billion deal to acquire its Dell Technologies (DVMT) tracking stock.

But crude retreated, undercutting $73 before closing the week off 0.5% at $73.80. U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.245 million barrels while gasoline supplies fell by 1.51 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said. Analysts polled by Platts S&P Global expected the EIA to report a 4.5 million decline in crude stockpiles and a 2.5 million barrel drop in gasoline stockpiles. Domestic crude production held at 10.9 million barrels per day for a third straight week. President Trump continued his attacks on OPEC, tweeting that the cartel should help lower gasoline prices as the U.S. supplies military defense for many member countries.The U.S. added 213,000 jobs in June, more than expected. April and May hiring also were revised higher. Annual wage growth of 2.7% was a bit less than expected, easing Fed rate hike fears.

336,KEY,"The IBD Stock of the Day is Google-parent Alphabet (IBD), a tech juggernaut that's struggled to outperform the S&P 500 but is showing signs of renewed strength.XA key indicator of this is Alphabet's relative strength line, which broke out to new highs the week of June 15. It's bullish when a stock's RS line hits a new high before the stock breaks out to a new price record. That suggests the stock, which is already outperforming the broad market, could continue to surge higher.Alphabet stock is approaching a new high with a buy point of 1,201.59. Shares closed at 1201.26, up 2.5%, on the stock market today. Alphabet stock is up 22% from an eight-month low of 984 set on March 28.Another positive sign is the sales growth rate, which is expected to exceed 20% for the next three quarters. Alphabet stock has held above its 50-day moving average for the past two months. It also has a solid IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a possible 99.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe global search-engine leader, Alphabet stock is closely watched for a number of reasons. It's in the elite group of FANG stocks, which also includes Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX). Mention FANG among a group of investors and heads turn.Another reason Alphabet stock is a big dog of tech is that Google collects the leading share of money spent on digital advertising, followed by Facebook. This year, Google is expected to receive 37% of U.S. digital ad spending. Facebook is likely to get 20%, according to research firm E-Marketer, combining for 57% of the market.Recent events might have something to do with Alphabet's stock rise. One is Facebook's recent entanglement in the Cambridge Analytica data-privacy scandal, which exposed personal information on millions of people.After government investigations both here and in Europe, the fallout is leading to increased regulations. While regulation is typically a snare, in this case it could favor Alphabet and Facebook, says a Wall Street analyst, who this week initiated buy ratings on both companies.Their breadth, depth and overall size put Facebook and Google in a better position than smaller companies. Alphabet is also a leader in the development and application of artificial intelligence vs. its competitors.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:IBD Stock Of The Day: Genetics Firm Breaks Out On Cancer Testing TrendsHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?

353,KEY,"Halliburton (HAL) said Monday that stresses on the U.S. rail system made deliveries of sand used in hydraulic fracturing less predictable, but shale companies are finding a work-around.Sand delivery was a major issue for the oilfield service provider in Q1 due to rail stoppages as exploration and production companies favor sand over customized man-made ceramics in ""slickwater"" fracs that rely on high volumes of water.""The U.S. rail system is experiencing high demand driven by strong economic activity,"" CEO Jeff Miller said during a conference call with analysts. ""This is adding stress to rails.""But Miller thinks the solution to the sand logistics issue will be the increased use of local sand.High-quality northern white sand shipped out of Wisconsin has long been a favorite among shale producers, but they are now looking at brown sand produced by Texas mines nearer the bustling Permian Basin.Hydraulic fracturing, the process of pressuring up wells until the surrounding rock reservoirs collapse and surrender their oil, requires vast quantities of sand to prop open channels in the ruptured stone through which oil and gas flow to the well.Halliburton shares erased intraday losses to trade up 0.2% at 52.05 on the stock market today.Crude oil prices erased early losses to trade up 0.4% at $68.64 a barrel, holding at a three-year high Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

358,KEY,"Consumer staples have been slumping lately, and key exchange traded funds tracking the sector are down from 6% to 13% this year, through Tuesday's close.So what's the culprit? One of the key reasons: higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury is now yielding about 3.08%, up sharply from around 2.4% at the beginning of the year. That makes bonds more attractive than dividends.Consumer staples stocks are considered a defensive play because people need these products no matter how the economy is doing, and the companies often offer steady dividends. When bond yields are low, dividend stocks look more compelling. But when bond yields rise, dividend stocks can look less attractive.Add to the sector's woes are a stronger dollar and weaker emerging-markets currencies, where consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) generate a sizable percentage of sales.

361,KEY,"The Fed hiked its key interest rate a quarter-point, as expected, on Wednesday, but surprised financial markets by signaling two more rate hikes this year to counter tax cut-fueled economic strength.The consensus Fed rate hike outlook shows a total of four increases this year, up from a prior view for three. Policymakers continue to see three more rate hikes in 2019. Bottom line: The Fed had been on the cusp of a hawkish shift and just got off the fence.After release of the policy statement and quarterly economic projections at 2 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite pulled back modestly, then recovered lost ground during Chairman Jerome Powell's uneventful news conference.Powell indicated that the rate-setting committee was cognizant of the risk of moving too quickly or too slowly, adding that policymakers also aren't overly worried about inflation exceeding 2%. ""The economy is great shape,"" Powell said.While the Fed continues to see economic risks as balanced, Powell seemed to emphasize a stance of gradual tightening to ""sustain that expansion"" by keeping things from overheating.Yet, the market's initial, limited reaction masked an ominous sign: a flatter yield curve. Firming inflation and Fed rate-hike expectations have pushed up short-term government bond yields. But the narrow gap between short-term and long-term Treasuries signals growing doubts about the durability of the economy's momentum.While Powell spoke, the 2-year Treasury yield pared its rise to 2.57%, closing to within 40 basis points of the 2.97% 10-year Treasury yield. That's the narrowest yield gap since 2007, when long-term rates fell below short-term rates, a reliable precursor of recession.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAhead of the meeting, Wall Street has worried on and off that recent economic indicators would compel policymakers to tighten too much. Inflation is near the Fed's 2% target, wages are finally perking up, and the unemployment rate is hovering around a 50-year low.At the May meeting, the Fed tried to tamp those fears by stressing that their inflation target is ""symmetric,"" meaning that exceeding 2% for a time is no more reason to panic than modest undershoots.The Fed, under new chair Powell, faces an unprecedented policy challenge. Fiscal stimulus has always been ordered up during a recession or at the start of a recovery. This time, President Trump and Congress are delivering a double dose of major tax cuts and spending hikes deep into the expansion, when growth was already firm and labor markets tight. The challenge is that policy works with a time lag. So almost as soon as the Fed adjusts policy to respond to economic strength, stimulus will be fading.""2019 is setting up to be a dangerous year, as the fiscal stimulus rolls off while the impact of the Fed's tightening will be peaking,"" Greg Jensen, co-chief investment officer of hedge fund behemoth Bridgewater Associates, wrote recently.Investors shouldn't take the quarterly economic projections to the bank. For one thing, some of the members, including a couple of doves, don't have votes, and the makeup of the committee will change as new Trump appointees are confirmed. More critically, if wage growth keeps accelerating, policymakers will update their views.While every signal the Fed sent was hawkish on Wednesday, it's worth noting that the consensus doesn't appear that firm. Only eight policymakers projected four 2018 rates hikes, while seven still expected three.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 4 Top Stocks In Buy Range Boast Rising Profit EstimatesAT&T Can Buy Time Warner; Court Ruling To Ignite Comcast, Disney BrawlIBD Stock Of The Day: Hot New China IPO iQiyi Flashes This Key Technical SignWhy This Biotech Company Is Bounding Closer To A BreakoutChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

377,KEY,"Just when it looked like the new normal of lackluster growth was history, Italy's political crisis threatens to throw a soggy pizza on the Trump economic boom.As Italian government bond yields surged on Tuesday, triggering long-dismissed fears about the fate of the European Union's currency area, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled nearly 400 points, or 1.6%, on the stock market today. The S&P 500 slid 1.2%.While those fears about a breakup of the euro may be overdone, the uncertainty surrounding Italy is likely to linger and exacerbate global economic fragility at a consequential time.Just consider how expectations have swung for the U.S. economy: A week ago, the odds of four Fed rate hikes in 2018 were just over 50%, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. Now those odds have sunk to 15%, and the odds of only two rate hikes have spiked to 44%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA relatively positive impact of the global flight to safety was to push U.S. Treasury yields lower, with the 10-year yield sliding to 2.79% and the two-year yield to 2.34%, which will lower borrowing costs for companies and consumers. But the 10-year yield has fallen harder, once again squeezing the yield spread and thus banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) — Dow Jones and S&P 500 components — skidded 4.3% and 3.4%, respectively, on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index continued its recent ascent, jumping to its highest level since July 2017.The roughly 6% rise in the dollar vs. other advanced economy currencies over the past three months is a negative for the earnings of U.S. multinationals, since it makes foreign-earned revenue worth less in dollar terms. But economists also see a stronger dollar as a negative for global growth, especially for emerging markets where companies often borrow in dollar-denominated debt that is harder to service when the local currency falls.A stronger dollar is already pressuring developing economies. The rush to safety sparked by Italy's political turmoil will add to that pressure, leading to outflows from emerging markets, and increasing financial vulnerability in places like Turkey and Argentina. Brazil is already reeling from a truckers strike.If a stronger dollar comes at the same time China's economy begins to slow, the global outlook could quickly shift from the best in a decade into a relative soft patch. Economic data from China over the past month have indeed been on the weaker side.European economies also have slowed, leaving the U.S. as the main standout of late. While there's reason to think that the U.S. economy has  enough of a head of steam to avoid a letdown this year, it may not approach the heights expected from the Trump tax cuts.The real risk is that when the stimulus from tax cuts and higher federal spending begins to ebb in late 2019, a softer global economic backdrop will further undercut U.S. momentum. Even if the Fed curbs rate-hike plans, monetary policy may still be too tight.Italy's underperforming, over-indebted economy and financial system emerged from crisis after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged in 2012 to do ""whatever it takes"" to preserve the currency union in 2012, then launched a massive bond-buying program. But now the question is whether Italian politics will allow Draghi to work his magic.The ECB had been moving to phase out its bond-buying program. While that's looking increasingly unlikely, Draghi will have limited ability to backstop Italian debt if political leaders remain bent on flouting EU budget deficit rules and embarking on a fiscal expansion.In March, Italians backed two populist parties, the 5 Star Movement and Northern League, which formed a tentative coalition government this month. The latest crisis erupted when Italian President Sergio Mattarella blocked their appointment of a euro critic as finance minister on Sunday. He then installed pro-market International Monetary Fund economist Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister.A new election could happen in late July, but a top EU official's warning stoked further outrage.""The coming weeks will show that the development of the markets, government bonds and the economy of Italy will be so far-reaching that this will be a possible signal to voters not to vote for populists on the right or left,"" European Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger said.Oettinger may be right, but it's also possible that Italians are fed up with EU rules after a prolonged period of economic stagnation.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Top Stock Set To Hit Buy Zone; Key Tech Sector Holds UpHow JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley Made The Bank Sell-Off Much WorseForget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarThese 4 Top Stocks Hit Buy Points, But Only One Closes In RangeStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

397,KEY,"Investors in dividend-rich real estate investment trusts should generally not expect to see big capital gains in such stocks. But the hefty payouts can make a high-quality REIT attractive for long-term holding. Consider Independence Realty Trust, an apartment REIT based in Philadelphia.Independence Realty (IRT) went public in August 2013 at $8.50 a share. The stock's close at 10.30 on Tuesday produces a 21% gain over nearly a five-year span.The S&P 500, in contrast, has rallied 64% since its close of 1655 in the week ended Aug. 16, 2013.Payouts, however, are a different story. As seen in the General Market Indicators page (view it via the link at the bottom of The Big Picture), the 500's annualized yield is 1.84%. The strong advance over the past nine years has depressed that yield somewhat. Still, the S&P 500 cannot hold a candle to Independence Realty's 7% yield.So, assuming the share price of Independence Realty Trust (IRT) doesn't move much from year to year, a long-term investor can aim at getting a decent return based on dividends alone.On April 20 and July 20, Independence paid holders 18 cents a share, up sharply from the 6 cents it paid over the prior four years going back to February 2014.The Philadelphia-based company focuses on selling apartment-building complexes that typically hold 150 to 500 units. As of mid-June, it owned and operated 56 multifamily properties totaling 15,280 units. Most of the properties are located in the South, parts of the Midwest (including Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri), and the Southwest. Key cities include Atlanta, Louisville, Ky., Memphis, Tenn., and Raleigh, N.C.As noted in a June 14 news release, IRT says its strategy is ""gaining scale within key amenity rich submarkets that offer good school districts, high-quality retail and major employment centers.""Revenue has shown excellent long-term growth, rising from $20 million in 2013 to $161 million last year.

398,KEY,"Biogen (BIIB) stock flirted with a breakout Friday, soaring more than 23% after the biotechnology giant said its Eisai-partnered Alzheimer's treatment slowed progression in Alzheimer's disease patients.On the stock market today, Biogen rocketed 19.6%, to close at 357.48, in high volume. Earlier, Biogen stock was up more than 23% to an intraday high of 367.89, and neared a buy point at 370.67 out of a consolidation. AC Immune (ACIU), which is also working on Alzheimer's treatments, popped about 38.3%, to end the session at 12.86.The stock pops followed news of Biogen and Japanese biotech Eisai's drug, called BAN2401. At a final 18-month analysis, the treatment slowed the progression of Alzheimer's in 856 patients with an early form of the disease.Most analysts say this lends credence to the theory that Alzheimer's is tied to the buildup of toxic plaque called beta-amyloid in the brain. BAN2401 and a later-stage Biogen drug called aducanumab work to remove that plaque.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe results for BAN2401 ""could not only enable Biogen to have a second shot on goal, but also provide strong validation for the hypothesis underling the key Phase 3 candidate — and potential future growth driver — aducanumab,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.Analysts noted the study had a unique design allowing Biogen multiple interim analyses to look for early effectiveness or futility. The study also used a marker called Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score, as well as a measure of reduction of amyloid using a PET scan to determine effectiveness.Researchers found a statistically significant reduction in amyloid and slowing progression in those who received the highest dose. The worst-case scenario would have been a reduction in beta amyloid, but not a slowing of progression. This would have disproved the theory, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a report.BAN2401 had ""an acceptable tolerability profile."" The most common side effect was brain swelling known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. ARIA is a common side effect of Alzheimer's treatments. It appeared in less than 10% of most patients and below 15% of those at the highest dose.RBC's Abrahams noted the way the study was designed ""stacks the deck in favor of its own success.""Further, the measure for progression was first proposed by Eisai researchers. In most Alzheimer's treatment studies, including aducanumab, researchers look for improvement as measured by the scale known as Clinical Dementia Rating — Sum of Boxes.The news for BAN2401 was largely unexpected. In December, the Alzheimer's treatment failed to meet its key goals at an interim analysis. But the biotechnology giant said it would continue the test out to the 18-month mark based on the fact it didn't appear futile.Biogen is preparing to release the full details at a future medical conference. Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said Biogen could take two tacts for BAN2401. It could seek approval based on the Phase 2 study, putting the drug on the market in late 2019. More likely, it will design a Phase 3 study.Meanwhile, analysts are scrambling to determine what the BAN2401 results mean for Biogen's key Alzheimer's treatment, aducanumab. Both drugs work to remove beta amyloid, though they aim for different types of the plaque. Aducanumab is set to have Phase 3 data in late 2019 or early 2020.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges was the key detractor for Biogen and Eisai's results. Unlike other analysts, he doesn't see the BAN2401 study as proving the beta-amyloid thesis for Alzheimer's disease. Further, the Food and Drug Administration hasn't yet weighted in on Eisai's alternative measure of progression.""There is very little detail about other more validated cognitive measures in the joint press release and we find no reason to believe this either proves or disproves the amyloid hypothesis or has an impact on the likelihood that aducanumab will succeed in its ongoing Phase 3 trial,"" he said in his note to clients.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Why Hope Endures For An Alzheimer's Treatment — And Biogen Could Be FirstChart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half Position

401,KEY,"Taking profits on the way up is a key part of a swing-trading strategy. The biggest problem? The fear of missing out on an even bigger gain. If you can train yourself to take that fear out of the decision, you can stack a number of gains together for a significant boost to your portfolio. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) provides a recent swing trade example.The move in American Eagle Outfitters started with a bullish reversal off the 50-day moving average (1). A bullish reversal can signal that a short-term pullback may be shifting directions. When looking for reversals, we aren't trying to catch the bottom on beaten down stocks. Rather, these are stocks in uptrends already showing relative strength vs. the market. American Eagle Outfitters had a Relative Strength Rating of 94. That means, despite its 12% pullback, it was in the top 6% of stocks in terms of price performance over the last 12 months.Volume was above average on the bounce from the 50-day line and it joined IBD's SwingTrader at 20.72. Two days later and it approached our 5% profit goal (2). We took half profits. Taking half profits on the way up allows you to lock in early gains while still participating if the rally continues. We also typically raise our stop. There is no reason to let a trade turn negative after you have a gain around 5%. We raised the stop to a 1% profit from our entry, in this case 20.93. With half profits booked and a raised stop, you help ensure a profitable trade.For American Eagle Outfitters, the gains continued to stretch and four days after our entry, the stock hit its 10% profit goal (3). With five days up in a row, a break is normal and expected. The market also had a bearish reversal a few days prior so locking in the full gain seemed prudent.Taking profits when they come that quickly can give your money some velocity. String together a number of gains back-to-back and your portfolio can turn in spectacular performance. It compresses the power of compounding into a shorter period. Of course, there's a trade-off. The stock can continue without you. You could be compounding your gain in one trade rather than many. That's the goal of position trading. The benefit of position trading is you can see some big numbers in your individual trades and reduce your transaction costs.In the case of American Eagle Outfitters, the stock did go up from our exit. Briefly. Just a few days later it took a 2.7% hit, putting the price back under our final exit (4). Our swing-trading strategy of taking profits helped optimize our gains for the short period of a week.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Taking Profits Early Is A Key Tenet Of Swing TradesTaking Profits: Swing Trade Example Netted a 15% Gain in 15 daysSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

404,KEY,"Biogen (BIIB) ceded some gains Tuesday after nearing a buy point last week following positive data for its Eisai-partnered Alzheimer's treatment.On the stock market today, Biogen stock lost 2.6% to close at 344.82. Earlier, shares fell as much as 4.2%. That followed a 1% decline on Monday as Biogen moved further away from a breakout at 370.67. Meanwhile, shares of biotech companies dipped less than 1%.Still, analysts remain bullish about the biotech companies' drug, dubbed BAN2401. On Friday, the biotech companies said BAN2401 slowed the clinical progression of Alzheimer's in patients with an early form of the disease. Biogen stock spiked 20% on the largely unexpected news.Previously, analysts hadn't given much credence to BAN2401, which failed to meet its goals at a prior interim analysis. Now, Biogen and Eisai will unveil final data for the study on July 25 at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe news gives Biogen two late-stage bites at the Alzheimer's treatment apple. Biogen also is working on a drug called aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. Both drugs target toxic plaque in the brain known as beta amyloid thought to cause Alzheimer's disease.""If successful in Phase 3, our (key opinion leader) believes aducanumab or BAN2401 would immediately become the standard-of-care treatment and utilized broadly despite the need to monitor or bimonthly (intravenous) infusions,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.Following the news on Friday, Biogen stock joined Investor's Business Daily's Big Cap 20 list.The biggest question now is what data will Biogen and Eisai present later this month, analysts say. The study of BAN2401 had a different design from other Alzheimer's treatment tests. It also used a different goal, called Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score, or ADCOMS, to determine the drug's effectiveness.""Neither company is divulging any details,"" Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said in his report to clients. It's possible the biotech companies could provide the full 18-month data, their definition of a statistically significant improvement in the study or a breakdown on the new marker for effectiveness.The ADCOMS marker is somewhat controversial. Most Alzheimer's treatment studies look at another measure to determine effectiveness, known as Clinical Dementia Rating — Sum Of Boxes, or CDR-SB. Biogen's wholly owned Alzheimer's treatment, aducanumab, is using the latter as its measure.But, according to the physician cited by RBC's Abrahams, an improvement in ADCOMS is a legitimate measure. He also is not concerned about the study's unique design, which allowed for multiple interim analyses of the data. Others have been critical of the new measure, saying its bar for success is too low.""Our (key opinion leader) felt that ADCOMS, despite its increased sensitivity, is indeed a legitimate endpoint, and given its makeup, could track similarly to the CDR-SB endpoint used in aducanumab studies,"" Abrahams said.RELATED:How To Trade: Why Biogen Fell Below Its Buy Point On Breakout Day, But Still Won BigBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?

Google's report has implications for Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all hit resistance at the 50-day moving average on Monday. Blame three key factors: Apple (AAPL) undercutting more support, the chip sector continuing to sell off and the 10-year Treasury yield moving to the edge of 3%.S&P 500 futures rose 0.6% vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures were 0.6% higher. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.75%. That suggests that they'll all make a run at their 50-day moving averages once again. But can they retake and hold that key support?It will be a heavy day of earnings before and after the open. Last night, Alphabet earnings beat estimates, even excluding an investment gain for its Uber stake. Revenue growth was the strongest in years. But traffic acquisition costs and capital spending both surged, slashing profit margins. In late trading, Google's parent fell slightly.

Google also signaled cloud computing was growing rapidly as it competes vs. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and Microsoft rose modestly in premarket trading. All four report later this week.In Monday's session, the S&P 500 closed a fraction higher, while the Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones fell modestly. But the major averages all continued to hold below their 50-day moving averages after falling below that key level Friday. In both sessions, the culprits were largely the same: Apple, chip stocks and Treasury yields.Apple fell 0.3% to 165.24, a modest retreat, amid fresh signs of weak iPhone X demand. But the stock fell below its 200-day moving average. Aside from a few days during the brief stock market correction in early February, Apple hadn't undercut that level since July 2016.Apple, which has skidded 7.3% in the past four sessions, also has undercut the low of its consolidation. Upside? Apple could now create a double-bottom base with a slightly lower entry. So, a relentless Apple bull could claim that the iPhone maker moved closer to a buy point on Monday.Shares rose 0.3% in the premarket, which would push Apple back to  its 200-day.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index retreated 1.3% on Monday, undercutting recent lows to its worst levels since the February correction. The Philly Sox index is just above its 200-day line, an area of support that it hasn't breached since July 2016. The semiconductor index has retreated 7.6% over the last four sessions.The 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 2.99%, settling for a modest rise to 2.975% after moving to a four-year high on Friday. The benchmark rate dipped to just under 2.97% on Tuesday, easing pressure on stock futures.Treasury yields are rising amid growing inflation concerns as well as the related risk of additional Fed rate hikes. Higher interest rates, all other things being equal, act as a brake on growth, making borrowing, such as for mortgages, more expensive. They make bonds relatively more attractive for investors. The higher yields also have pushed the U.S. dollar index to a three-month high. That makes U.S. exports less competitive and reducing the profitability of foreign operations for U.S. multinationals, in dollar terms.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stock Indexes Struggle To Cross This Key LevelWill The Stock Market Rally Continue?

417,KEY,"This week's big planned Trump administration announcement of emergency investment and export rules targeting China is out, and it doesn't include any rules or even mention China. By now it should be clear that Trump is bending over backwards to soothe Beijing and avoid a China trade war.Instead of detailing tough new emergency measures, including a reported 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology, Trump will instead back legislation moving through Congress to update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.In a statement that never mentions China, Trump noted, ""certain countries direct and facilitate systematic investment in United States companies and assets in order to obtain cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property in industries those countries deem important.""Last week, Trump called members of Congress to the White House to stop them from interfering with his plan to save 70,000 Chinese tech jobs at communications equipment firm ZTE put at risk by U.S. sanctions.Trump's moves appear designed to facilitate progress in trade negotiations ahead of a July 6 Trump tariff deadline that may dramatically intensify the emerging China trade war. On that date, the U.S. is to impose 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech-related imports, with tariffs on another $16 billion in goods due shortly thereafter. China has said it will match Trump tariffs dollar for dollar, whenever they are imposed.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq all rallied early Wednesday on hopes that Trump's move to delay investment and export restrictions might keep the China trade war on the back burner.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Trump had been ""spooked"" by Monday's market sell-off, which helped spur the change in plans.Trump has already made clear that he wants a trade deal, not a China trade war, and he came close to reaching one in May that would have had Beijing buy an additional $70 billion in U.S. goods. Trump touted the emerging deal, tweeting that China would  ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.China appears open to such a deal, if it can avert tariffs and trade restrictions that jeopardize its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy.Trump's latest decision could be a reprieve for the semiconductor sector.

418,KEY,"Tesla stock sank below an important indicator Tuesday as analysts continued to digest its report on Model 3 production that hit key goals of Chief Executive Elon Musk but fell short in other areas.XThe electric-car maker on Sunday said it produced 5,031 Tesla Model 3 vehicles in the last week of the second quarter, inching past its goal of 5,000 vehicles for the first time. That production level is critical for the company to reach profitability.Following the report, Tesla stock initially jumped 6% early Monday, then ended the regular trading session down 2.3% after analysts looked deeper into the Tesla statement.Tesla stock closed down 7.2% to 310.86 on the stock market today. Shares fell below its 200-day moving average, a key indicator by traders and market analysts for determining the overall long-term trend. Tesla stock also fell to its 50-day moving average. A breach of the 50-day line can be a sell signal.In order for Tesla to reach production goals Musk allegedly asked engineers to halt putting Model 3 vehicles through a standard brake and roll alignment test on June 26, according to a report from Business Insider. In a statement, Tesla responded that ""we drive every Model 3 on our test track to verify braking, torque, squeal and rattle.""Among those not impressed with the report on Model 3 production was Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino. He maintained a sell rating on Tesla stock and price target of 195. That's 61% below where Tesla stock currently trades. Among his concerns were that although Tesla reached its production goal, the company did not ship as many Model 3s as expected.The company said it delivered 18,440 Model 3s in the second quarter. That's about 10,000 units short of analyst estimates.Analysts were also concerned that the high level of enthusiasm for Tesla vehicles may be waning. Tamberrino thinks that might be the reason Tesla shares fell Monday.Tesla said it had about 420,000 net Model 3 reservations at the end of the second quarter. That's down from 455,000 reservations during the company's July 2017 Model 3 unveiling.""This indicates that net reservations have decreased by approximately 16,600 (taking into consideration delivery figures) from the end of the first quarter,"" Tamberrino wrote in a research note to clients. He said this comes after the company had noted that reservations were stable the previous two quarters.On the flip side is Tesla bull Romit Shah at Nomura, who has perhaps the highest stock-price target on record. Following the Tesla report, Shah maintained a buy rating on Tesla and price target of 450.Tesla hitting production targets ""is an important milestone that we believe reestablishes some credibility and positions the company for profitability in the second half of the year,"" Shah wrote in a research note to clients. ""That said, we continue to expect Tesla stock to be volatile near term.""Also of concern to analysts is the company spending cash at a hefty clip, which recently forced a 9% reduction in staff. Tesla's cash burn and debt load are among the reasons it's one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street.RELATED:Can Tesla Stand The Heat As It Burns Through Cash?Tesla Stock Pops As Musk Teases Pickup Truck Details In TweetAnnual Meeting Reveals China Battery Plant, Teases Model Y PlansGet these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Still, Linenberg lowered his price targets on those carriers amid the macroeconomic and geopolitical tension.""While we believe these stocks are likely to outperform over the next six months, we are mindful of the second order effects of a growing trade dispute, which would likely mean that all US airline stocks are at risk of collateral damage,"" he wrote.Shares of Delta slipped 2.3% in the stock market today, hitting their lowest levels in nearly five months.American Airlines stock fell 1.6%, while United lost 1.1%. Shares of Southwest Airlines, which has tapered its capacity growth for this year, edged down 2 cents after briefly reclaiming its 50-day line.

And because of that, you want to buy as close to the buy point as possible, rather than following the 5% buy rule for breakouts from proper bases.Speaking of proper bases, TransUnion stock is now extended some 19% from a flat-base buy point of 61.52.

435,KEY,"Finding the best biotech companies to invest in can be tricky as volatility often pockmarks the space. Clinical plans don't always come to fruition and sometimes biotech stocks can suffer at the hands of regulatory decisions from the Food and Drug Administration.But the best biotech companies to invest in tend to have a commonality: A strong streak of earnings growth. As of June 2018, Investor's Business Daily's MarketSmith.com has two biotech stocks among a 150-strong list of the fastest growing stocks.Near the top of the list of fastest growing stocks, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) is ranked eighth. Over the past five years, its earnings per share have grown a massive 147%, compared to 319% for the top-earning stock, Momo (MOMO), a Chinese social media firm.Supernus has made a name for itself among biotech stocks. Though in terms of market cap it still trails bigger biotech companies like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG). But Supernus lands itself on the list you might consider as the best biotech companies to invest in for strong metrics. As always, do your research before buying any stock, and be sure to check the company's stock chart to make sure it's the right time to buy.It has several years of double-digit quarterly sales growth with drugs that help disorders of the central nervous system. Among those, Supernus counts epilepsy drugs Oxtellar XR (extended-release) and Trokendi XR.Trokendi XR is also approved to prevent migraines. It rivals drugs like Botox from Allergan (AGN) and Amgen's Aimovig.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) is unique among biotech stocks. Though IBD ranks it No. 144 out of 150 of the fastest growing stocks — which might put it on your research list for the possible best biotech companies to invest in — it doesn't market a single drug.Instead, Ligand acquires early-stage technologies necessary for drug development.

Prices range from $399 to more than $549.The sub-$400 price point is key for Microsoft as it tries to turn its Surface business into a more serious challenger to other computer hardware makers. Cheaper devices can attract students who get comfortable with the technology and spread it to the workplace after they graduate.That strategy has helped Apple, which unveiled a $299 iPad earlier this year for schools. Google also has seen success with its low-cost Chromebook laptops.The Surface Go is still more expensive than the cheapest iPad, but the Go tablet is compatible with professional features, like the detachable keyboard, that are missing on the entry-level iPad.

The software giant kicked off its consumer hardware push in 2012 with the launch of the Surface RT. These tablets didn't resonate with consumers, so the company focused more on pricier Pro models.So far, Microsoft has struggled to make a hit Surface product.

439,KEY,"An agreement by Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) to defer drug price increases in an effort to play nice with President Donald Trump led analysts Wednesday to question what the fallout of the drug giant's action would be for the industry.Analysts wondered whether other pharmaceutical companies would follow Pfizer's example. Though, notably, Celgene (CELG) is still going ahead with 5% increases for blockbuster cancer drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report.""Pfizer's unprecedented reversal of its early July price increases marks tangible administrative influence,"" Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said in his report to clients. He noted Pfizer is awaiting more details from a so-called blueprint to tug down drug prices in the U.S.Late Tuesday, Pfizer said Chief Executive Ian Read had an extensive discussion with Trump, leading the company to back off price increases on drugs that had been effective July 1. Earlier in the week, Trump attacked Pfizer and others for raising ""drug prices for no reason.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Pfizer shares the president's concern for patients and commitment to providing affordable access to the medicines they need,"" Read said in a written statement. He also noted Pfizer had committed $5 billion of capital to expand manufacturing in the U.S.But not everyone jived with Pfizer's and Trump's announcements.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called on Pfizer and the Trump administration to reveal the details of the arrangement that led Pfizer to back off drug prices increases.""Secret, sweetheart arrangements with Big Pharma companies are exactly why America's drug pricing system is broken,"" he tweeted. ""Trump and his Admin are busy trying to score cheap PR points why Pharma (companies) continue to raise prices by DOUBLE digits.""Pfizer stock dipped 0.6% at the close, to 37.21. Broadly, shares of pharmaceutical companies fell about the same amount on the stock market today.Trump renewed his pledge in May to lower the cost of prescription medicine in the U.S. At the time, analysts largely said the proposed blueprint appeared to be more rhetoric than reform.Morgan Stanley's Risinger believes Pfizer's U.S. price increase reversal could have slightly negative implications for the second-quarter earnings season. He notes Pfizer's updated guidance commentary will be key later this month.""In addition, the news could put a near-term damper on future price increase action by other pharma-bio companies,"" he said. ""But Pfizer indicated that its action is temporary since it only committed to keeping prices unchanged through the end of 2018.""Other pharmaceutical companies could also rethink their 2019 guidance, he said.""Whether manufacturers limit themselves to one price increase per year or hold off entirely on customary January increases is key swing factor to earnings which we think is underestimated by the market,"" he said.Even Celgene's price increases for Revlimid and Pomalyst remain in line with 2018 medical inflation of 5.3%, RBC's Abrahams said. They are also below historical increases. Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) joined Pfizer and walked back on planned price increases, he noted.""We see this more reserved price increase and increased transparency as potentially tempering headline risk and public scrutiny, as has been experienced by Pfizer, and it's in line with our view that companies will self-police in price increases to a much larger degree from now on,"" he said.Also Wednesday, Pfizer announced it would split its business into three distinct units in 2019 as it contends with looming losses of exclusivity. Under the restructuring, Pfizer's Innovative Medicines division will include biosimilars, anti-infection drugs and sterile injectables. Its Established Medicines unit will include off-patent branded and generic drugs, Finally, the company's Consumer Healthcare branch will hold all over-the-counter medicines.Innovative Medicines will run all the current Innovative Health businesses as well as the new Hospital Medicines business unit. Pfizer will also incorporate its biosimilar portfolio into its Oncology, and Inflammation and Immunology units.Established Medicines will hold the majority of Pfizer's off-patent drugs. This includes Lyrica, cholesterol drug Lipitor, high blood pressure drug Norvasc and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. The business will run globally.The unit is meant to operate ""as a true stand-alone business within Pfizer,"" the company said in a news release. It will have its own manufacturing, marketing, regulatory and, with some exceptions, enabling functions.Consumer Healthcare, on the other hand, differs from Pfizer's two prescription medicine businesses, Pfizer said. The firm confirmed it's still mulling strategic alternatives for this unit. It expects to make a decision before the end of the year.""Trends in consumerism and an increased focus on staying healthy are causing consumers to seek easily accessible health and wellness solutions,"" the firm said.

441,KEY,"When people have had military careers as long as ours, they develop a keen understanding not just of war but also of the conditions leading up to it. Over the years, we have had front-row seats to hostilities in various regions of the world, and our attention often focused on the initial outbreak of those hostilities.Now, viewing current conditions through that lens, we are worried about the possibility of a larger war enveloping the Middle East – one in which the United States and its allies would be necessarily involved.As those conditions persist, the international community must do one of two things: Either ready itself for war or address the situation that is making it an ever more likely possibility. There is no question that the American public and nearly all U.S. policymakers would prefer the latter option. The trouble is that only a minority of them recognize the warning signs, and even fewer have a clear sense of which actions might slow the region's march toward war.To their credit, some key figures in the Trump administration have expressed an understanding of one of the most serious contributors to the existing threat. Defense Secretary James Mattis, for instance, has repeatedly affirmed that among all the crises engulfing the Middle East, the common element in almost all of them is the Islamic Republic of Iran.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe clerical regime has already had the effect of prolonging and worsening specific conflicts like the wars in Syria and Yemen, and is promoting sectarianism all over the region.For that reason, the most important thing the international community can do to prevent such a conflict from breaking out is contain Iran's regional activities while addressing their root causes. Unfortunately, policies leading toward that goal will surely face pushback from defenders of the status quo, who generally worry that all efforts to confront or contain regional adversaries constitute a rush to war.But anyone who is familiar with military history should recognize that the most troublesome wars tend to emerge out of long periods of inaction, during which responsible parties ignored festering hostilities and simply hoped for tensions to deescalate on their own.That is a course of action we cannot afford, since any forthcoming war would almost certainly engulf the entire region and undermine our interests for years or decades to come. And this is to say nothing of the impact it would have on the peoples of the Middle East, including those who are directly subject to the rule of the war's key instigator, the Iranian regime.It may be helpful to point out that the Iranian people recognize the danger they are facing and stand ready to assist the effort to diminish their government's ambitions and limit the role of Iranian sectarianism in neighboring countries like Syria.With this in mind, the governments of the U.S. and Europe should recognize the potential impact of forcing Tehran to confront domestic conditions instead of striving to exploit regional vulnerabilities. This isn't a particularly difficult task, considering that the Islamic Republic is already being rocked by widespread unrest as the people protest several serious issues as well as the very nature of the regime.In December and January, a nationwide uprising engulfed 140 Iranian localities and took the regime by surprise. That surprise was evident from the fact that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei was left with no choice but to break with his traditional strategy of downplaying and denying the political strength of the pro-democratic opposition. He publicly attributed the protests' rapid spread and provocative slogans to the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK/PMOI).In the ensuing months, Iranian activists and workers continued staging large demonstrations in clear defiance of the violent repression that put the January uprising on pause.Defenders of the status quo may be uncomfortable with the notion of persistent unrest in Iran. But for global stability and for the Iranian people themselves, this is a far preferable alternative to the Islamic Republic keeping its attention focused beyond its border, where it can continue sowing the seeds of region-wide conflict while threatening to set off a war that the U.S. cannot ignore.On June 30, Iranian expatriates and thousands of political supporters held a major rally in Paris to support the Iranian demonstrators. The annual event typically attracts a crowd of 100,000 to call attention to domestic pressures against Iran's clerical regime and to outline Western policies that might help to enhance that pressure and contribute to the establishment of democratic governance in Iran.This year, more than 33 current and former U.S. officials attended.This gathering is a first step toward promoting Iran's domestic resistance movement and signaling commitment to helping it to avert a larger war in the region. This would make permanent the otherwise temporary effects of just containing Iran's regional activities.This is to say, the root cause of those activities and of the looming Middle East war is the very nature of the mullahs' regime, and in order to eliminate the present risks once and for all,that regime must give way to its overwhelmingly pro-democratic and peace-loving population.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

451,KEY,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) seemingly outperformed rival Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) in tests of the biotech companies' treatments for a progressive rare disease, an analyst said Thursday.Both biotech companies are making treatments for a condition known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. In this disease, mutations in a key gene cause abnormal protein deposits to accumulate throughout the body. This can lead to systemic damage and is often fatal.This week, the biotech companies presented results of pivotal studies of their drugs — Alnylam's patisiran and Ionis's inotersen. At the same time, the New England Journal of Medicine published an editorial from Joel Buxbaum, a professor with the Scripps Research Institute.""Patisiran dominates inotersen, based on NEJM publications,"" Chardan analyst Gbola Amusa said in a note to clients.

453,KEY,"Holding through a stock's significant decline that could lead to a new potential base is a challenging prospect. Who wants to sit through a potential 15% or 20% drawdown for an indeterminate period of time with virtually nothing but a belief that the stock will head higher? Yet that is one way to make long-term outstanding gains with true leaders in a healthy stock market.Let's take a look at PayPal (PYPL), which had a big move from its first-stage base in late April 2017 until its sell-off in the first two weeks of February this year.The stock moved sharply above its first buy point — a shallow six-month cup with handle with a 43.90 entry — on April 24, 2017, just days ahead of the company's quarterly results. A strong first-quarter report sent the stock soaring more than 6% on April 27; volume surged 459% above its 50-day average.At least four aspects factor into a decision to hold a stock long-term.First and foremost is the stock's fundamental story. PayPal has become a household name; users ""venmo"" each other money. Venmo is a digital wallet that allows you to send money to friends or make purchases and has become one of PayPal's strongest-growing services.Second, check out the company's quarterly earnings and sales. PayPal has recently posted five quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. Accelerating growth means that earnings showed a larger percentage gain in the latest quarter than in the prior quarter. At least two quarters of accelerating earnings growth is a bullish fundamental metric shared by many of the stock market's big winners. IBD Stock Checkup shows the number of quarters of accelerating EPS growth for every stock.Third, a nice profit cushion is a requisite for holding a stock. A flat base can correct up to 15% and still be proper. Meanwhile, the math off the top can be brutal. A 15% decline erases an almost 18% profit, so starting off with a greater than 20% gain is a solid idea.Finally, patience is the last necessary quality, and only when the market is in a solid uptrend. Letting a stock idea bake requires the ability to focus on the macro picture and not the daily price swings from high to low.Remember, weekly charts — found on IBD and MarketSmith — come first. It's easy to lose your way in the daily volatility of a stock's action, and the weekly chart smooths out that choppiness. A simple longer-term sell rule is the first significant close below the 10-week line (or the 50-day moving average on a daily chart). Leading stocks can go months, even years, without taking out that institutional support level.Even when PayPal built a 13.6%-deep flat base at the end of 2017, the 10-week line guided the stock higher. The new base featured a 79.48 buy point, 10 cents above the left-side high.In the week ended Feb. 2 this year, PayPal plunged through its 10-week line, closing down over 10% on the week in volume surging 105% above the 10-week average. It was the stock's first significant close below that level since the start of its move back in April, over nine months ago. On Feb. 6, PayPal fell more than 7% below the latest buy point, triggering a key loss-cutting sell rule. Driving the stock lower was news that its former parent, eBay (EBAY), would be ending their relationship by switching to a new digital payments provider.While that seems like a big giveback off the top, even selling at the Feb. 6 session low of 72.25 still captures a gain of at least 64% from the early cup-with-handle buy point of 43.90, while giving the stock room for an ever bigger move to the upside. You have to be willing to sacrifice a portion of your profit for greater potential upside, which underscores the importance of maintaining a lower-cost basis.It's great to have conviction, but only as long as the stock is going up. Remember, while buying a stock is primarily driven by its fundamentals, selling a stock is most definitively based on the chart. When it starts to trigger classic sell signals, it's time to listen to the stock and lock in hard-fought gains, especially when the market environment is falling apart.If the market regains its stride and the stock constructively builds a new base, you can always buy the stock back at a new risk-optimal buy point.(A version of this article was first published on Feb. 9, 2018.)Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Which Way Is The Stock Market Headed?

454,KEY,"After running up three weeks in a row, gaining nearly 11% in the process, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) is taking a well-needed breather.But with the stock dropping as much as 6% intraday Monday, should shareholders lock in gains?Answering this question spurs a pair of questions. First, would you be happy with a profit of 20% in a short period of time since Supernus cleared its latest correct buy point? If yes, then the recent action has justified a move to sell on the way up.The expert in treatments for epilepsy and migraine headaches broke out of a nearly eight-month cup with handle May 9. Volume was sharply above average, yet the stock closed below the 49.85 entry. No matter. Supernus kept climbing. At the end of a six-day spurt, the small-cap growth stock rose to a high of 59.05, up a stout 18%.The base is first stage.In the past two weeks, Supernus reached the 20% profit level as shares tried to conquer price resistance at 60. Selling most of your winners when the gain reaches 20% to 25% is smart portfolio management.And nabbing such a double-digit profit during a market in which the S&P 500 has risen just 1.7% during the first six months of 2018? It's like a scoring a goal against a World Cup contender from well outside the penalty area.At the same time, Supernus hasn't flashed any defensive sell signals.As a weekly chart shows, the stock has maintained firm support along the 10-week moving average.After a long run-up, a sharp plunge through the 10-week line, usually in volume that jumps 40% or more about average, typically signals that a good stock is ready to correct sharply in price and possibly form a new base.Investors can benefit in their portfolio decisions by asking themselves this: How much conviction do I have in the company itself?Judging by Supernus' recent results, a decision to try to hold longer and see if the company can, at one point, achieve midcap status is reasonable.In the year 2014, the Rockville, Md., company hit a milestone on the top line. Revenue hit $122 million, breaking the $100 million mark. Yet the relatively young company, incorporated in 2005, lost money for a fifth straight year. But in 2015, Supernus made another key milestone. It earned 28 cents a share as revenue jumped 21% to $147 million.Since then, growth has stayed hot.In 2017, Supernus earned $1.26 a share, up 350% from 2015. Sales broke the $300 million barrier on an annual basis, growing 41% to $302 million.In the past four quarters, the top line jumped 47%, 42%, 42% and 57%. It looks increasingly likely that the company will soon achieve $100 million in sales in a single quarter.For the first quarter this year, Supernus said that total product prescriptions for Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR rose 49% to 200,878.According to IBD Stock Checkup, the stock's 99 Earnings Per Share Rating places it in the No. 1 rank within IBD's biotech industry group.Supernus also makes the Sector Leaders screen. As noted on a Leaderboard daily and weekly chart, Supernus recently created a narrow five-week flat base that produced a new buy point at 59.15.The breakout past that entry has been less than savory so far. The gain from that new correct buy point?

459,KEY,"Wall Street showed continued confidence in the economy on Thursday as FAANG companies and other market leaders flexed strength in stocks today. The buying surge offset weak moves by some names in the apparel retail, department-store and bank industries.The Nasdaq composite roared more than 1.3% higher by day's end and notched a new all-time high of 7823, up 13.3% for the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trailed with gains of nearly 0.8% to 0.9%. Volume ran nearly 10% higher vs. Wednesday on the Nasdaq and fell nearly 5% on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Among the FAANG plays, Netflix (NFLX) cooled off with a 1.2% decline to 413.50 in trading that boosted 43% above usual levels. Yet the stock holds a comfortable cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The Leaderboard member is up 115% year to date. The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group.

464,KEY,"EVERETT, Wash. — The Boeing (BA) 787 Dreamliner has opened up 180 new markets for the aerospace giant's customers in the last six years, according to Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing.XWhile the 787s entered commercial service in 2011 years behind schedule and after development costs that reportedly topped $30 billion, the planes' lighter composite materials and cutting-edge engines transformed the cost-benefit analysis of intercontinental travel in planes smaller than jumbo jets like the 747.""They bring a blend of size and efficiency and operating costs that allows our customers to open up new routes that hadn't been profitable with older airplanes,"" Tinseth told IBD in an interview recently at Boeing's massive plant near Seattle.The explosion of new routes also confirmed Boeing's bet more than a decade earlier that more direct point-to-point travel would drive demand. Meanwhile, rival Airbus (EADSY) invested about $30 billion in its superjumbo A380, betting that the hub-and-spoke model, in which passengers have layovers at top-tier airports to catch connecting flights, would continue.Airbus has since answered the 787 with its A350-XWB and is struggling to maintain demand for the A380. But its A320neo narrow-body jet has enabled new intercontinental flights as well, forcing Boeing to come up with an answer in that class.Here are five surprising new direct routes for the 787:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTravel to top eastern Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai have always been popular. But now the 787 has opened up routes in western China deeper in the country's interior.Despite being unfamiliar to many Americans, Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, is more populous than any U.S. city. Now passengers can fly to Chengdu from Los Angeles' LAX and New York's JFK, thanks to 787s in Hainan Airlines's fleet.There is also an Ethiopian Airlines flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Chengdu as China extends its presence in Africa, where key industrial minerals are mined.""The long thin routes ... like secondary markets in the U.S. or lesser known cities in China, they are growing about five times faster than the markets to and from those big hubs,"" Tinseth said.The 787 has also enabled new flights to second-tier cities in China's southeast, like Shenzhen, Fuzhou and Xiamen.In March, Qantas Airways launched the 9,000-mile, nonstop flight on a Boeing Dreamliner. It was the first direct air link between the two continents. And the route is the third-longest commercial passenger flight in operation as well as the world's longest Dreamliner flight.Airlines are also using Airbus' offerings for long haul flights. Singapore Airlines will relaunch a Singapore-to-Newark, N.J., flight in October with the Airbus A350-900ULR. Singapore Airlines served this route previously in a less efficient Airbus A340-500. The high cost of operating the nearly 9,000-mile distance forced the airline to abandon the route in 2013.Tinseth said he hopes that eventually there will be a Sydney to London flight. But the route is ""a really long way.""Other innovations on the 787 help it serve long-haul trips, such as the plane's ability to optimize humidity levels in the cabin.""The efficiency has made a difference and frankly the passenger experience on these new aircraft like the 787 provide the opportunity for customers to be more comfortable,"" Tinseth said.There were already direct flights between London and most major cities in the U.S. before the Dreamliner's debut. But when it came to secondary cities with high passenger volume, New Orleans ranked near the top. British Airways now flies there from Heathrow.""There are enough people in London and people connecting through Europe who want to go to New Orleans, but the fares aren't high,"" said Seth Kaplan, managing partner of Airline Weekly. Most are vacation travelers not the more lucrative business travelers.With a fairly large volume of travelers that want low fares, taking a larger, more-expensive plane wouldn't make sense economically.""With the Dreamliner you have an aircraft with only a modest number of seats that could fly a really long distance and do it with excellent economics per seat mile basis,"" Kaplan said.Low-cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle flies between Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., and Barcelona in Spain. Norwegian also serves Oakland, Calif., from Denmark's capital Copenhagen.Kaplan noted that it's cheaper to operate from airports in Ft. Lauderdale and Oakland vs. their neighbors like Miami and San Francisco.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Airline Industry News And Stocks To WatchDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks Near A Buy ZoneIBD Stock Of The Day

480,KEY,"You'd think one of the oldest mutual funds would have figured out by now how to beat its benchmark on a consistent basis. And you'd be right. The $55.7 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) notches top results by holding leading growth stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Growth Stock Fund, which opened in April 1950, has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year, and 15-year annualized periods as of May 31 of this year, according to Morningstar.com. Since inception, the fund has posted an average annual return of 11.06% through May 31. That compares to an 11.3% return for the S&P 500. In the first five months of this year, the fund was up 8.54% vs. the S&P's 2.02%, and 6.73% for the large-cap growth mutual funds that are its direct rivals.Joe Fath, who's managed the fund since 2014, says holdings like Amazon, Booking, Alibaba, Microsoft and Alphabet share one key trait. ""We're looking for innovative disruptors,"" Fath said. ""It's a unique time. We're going through a powerful information revolution. Massive platform businesses are being built on top of powerful technology, and building a powerful network effect between users and platforms.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFath seeks large-caps that can become megacaps because their growth is accelerating on a very big base of business.""Google is a good example of that,"" Fath said, referring to Google's parent Alphabet. ""They've been able to grow their top line 20% (annually) for a long period of time and that continues even as the company becomes much larger. The other big thing is they don't rest on the profit pool they've created. They continue to invest and break down barriers to new areas.""So far this year, Alphabet is up about 9% while Amazon is up about 46%. Gains by Alibaba, Booking and Microsoft range in between.The fund is large-cap focused, all $10 billion or more, mostly domestic with only 8% in foreign stocks as of March 31. Still, the fund has additional international exposure through its large-cap U.S. stocks, many of which have multinational operations.To bring a stock into the fund, Fath needs to see double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow year-over-year.Fath assesses a company's total addressable market by asking: Is it in an area ripe for disruption? Who are the new entrants? He looks for stocks where the market under-appreciates the speed, pace and durability of a company's growth.Online retailer Amazon is the fund's top holding because it's the ""perfect example"" of the innovative disruptor.""It's going into many different directions at the same time and disrupting many different parts of the marketplace,"" Fath said.The biggest area is e-commerce, driven by its Prime membership. The second is its cloud offering, Amazon Web Services. But it has other irons in the fire. The two biggest are advertising and hardware. Amazon is doing more advertising for third-party merchants that use Amazon as their storefront. It's also moving into home devices with the Alexa speaker system to compete with Google and Apple (AAPL).Fath said Booking, the online travel agent that runs Booking.com, has a powerful business model. He said it's accumulated an inordinate amount of supply in Europe by adding a lot of branded and independent hotels, as well as alternative vacation homes and bed-and-breakfasts.He said it's put pressure on aggregator travel sites such as Trivago by being more efficient with its marketing spend to drive people to its own site.Another big holding is Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Fath said it has probably one the best business models and is very cash-flow generative. It's at the epicenter of taking advantage of China's rising middle class, which can buy more and more goods and services.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) has seen its shares rise more than 60% over the past year. First-quarter earnings per share jumped 43% as revenue and profits topped expectations. The company makes the robotic da Vinci Surgical System. Its profitability is based on the classic razor-razor blade business model. It makes money on its robotic surgical system, then creates a recurring revenue stream with additional profits through sales of service contracts and disposable items like surgical blades and other instruments and accessories.Fath also likes Nike (NKE), which has been out of favor as competitor Adidas (ADDYY) hustled its way to a resurgence in the U.S. He said Nike is beginning to ramp up its innovation engine, and will soon pump up a number of products, including its React sneaker line. Going forward, Fath said, ""We feel very good about the fundamentals.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeNew ETF Aims To Provide A steady 7% Annual Distribution Rate

481,KEY,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) keeps on shining. Lead manager Thomas Galvin has been at the helm almost 15 years. And over the past 15 years this growth fund has outpaced 86% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar.com, with an average annual return of 11.44% vs. 9.65% for its peers, going into Thursday.That outperformance has been fueled by focusing on stocks with superior earnings growth opportunities and attractive valuations. The ""select"" part of the $4 billion fund's name refers to the managers' concentrated approach, focusing on just their highest conviction ideas such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce (CRM) and Nvidia (NVDA).And the managers apply quantitative tools to manage risk. In a nutshell, a key step is to limit holdings' correlations, so their stocks are not vulnerable to the same risks. Ideally, any one torpedo in the form of a market problem won't sink more than one holding.This growth fund has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year and 15-year periods on an annualized basis through June 20. Year to date, the fund is up 14.95% vs. the S&P's 4.46% and 10.67% for large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar.com.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseManagers Thomas Galvin, Richard Carter and Todd Herget each focus on different sectors, looking for companies that sustain above-average earning growth. They look for companies driven by secular opportunities rather than cyclical ups and downs.""We try to find companies that will grow their sales and earnings two times over the broader market,"" Carter said.On average, companies in the S&P 500 Index grew earnings about 6% annually from 1960 through 2017, Carter says. He and his teammates look for companies that are growing earnings more than 12% a year. On average, they end up picking companies posting earnings growth closer to 18% to 20%.""If we can find companies that are growing faster than the broader market, while improving and maintaining margins and returns on invested capital, we think that's a high-growth opportunity,"" Carter said.It's a best-ideas growth fund that holds 25 to 35 stocks. Carter says they're not trying to benefit from easy earnings comparisons year-over-year or quick spikes in energy prices or interest rates that are more cyclical in nature.Instead, this growth fund seeks firms benefiting from secular themes involving demographics, innovation, productivity and low costs. They want companies gaining market share, generating returns on equity above the market and balance sheets with little or no debt.Carter says 50% of the portfolio consists of established growth companies. The other 50% consists of emerging growth companies.Established growth companies are familiar names with stable profits, growing earnings by about 10% to 15%. This includes names such as Visa (V) and Nike (NKE).Emerging growth companies are raising earnings much faster, typically between about 20% and 30%, such as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA).With only a $15 billion market cap, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, which is stealing market share from both department stores and drugstores. Its sales growth is four times the entire retail sector, Carter says.One of this growth fund's long-term plays is Booking Holdings (BKNG), which includes online travel agencies Booking.com and Priceline. The fund originally bought the stock in 2009 at 100 per share. Now it's trading around 2,122.""In 2009, it was growing earnings north of 30%,"" Carter said. ""Today it's closer to 15% to 20%. We've owned it the entire time. It's gone from an emerging growth name to a more established growth name. It had high returns on equity when we bought it and it still does.""PayPal (PYPL) benefits as e-commerce grows as a share of U.S. GDP. It's the largest market share payments platform in the online world. It's growing quarterly sales north of 20% and earnings around 30%. It has strong ROE. It's driven not only by the shift of people moving from cash to virtual payments, but by people shifting their shopping online from physical retail stores.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:New ETF Aims To Provide A Steady 7% Annual Distribution Rate

Boston has a number of implantable devices for cardiac conditions, neurological disorders and chronic pain relief.

489,KEY,"General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Waymo and Intel (INTC) lead auto and tech companies pouring big bucks into self-driving cars. But consumers aren't buying into this new technology.XThere are two key numbers to consider: Car buyers say they are willing to pay $2,300 for autonomous-vehicle features. But current AV systems cost around $22,900 — nearly 10 times more. That's according to a recent AlixPartners study.That actually underestimates the cost of autonomous vehicles. AVs being developed generally are all-electric or hybrids, adding several thousand dollars above the cost of a gas-powered vehicle.Those figures help explain why automakers have placed their AV bets on shared, commercial services, known as robotaxis, rather than sales to individual consumers.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGlobally, companies are pouring more than $60 billion into AV investments. They're also spending $255 billion to develop electric vehicles over the next eight years, up from $25 billion over the past eight years, the AlixPartners report said. Yet ""EV costs are still years away from being competitive,"" it  added.The study authors warned that ""a pileup of epic proportions"" awaits the auto industry, with steep investments coming as the auto market slows. They added that autonomy and electrification represent both opportunity and risks.GM stock fell 2.7% in Friday's stock market trading, closing below their 50-day moving average. Shares fell for the week and month amid heightened trade-war fears. Ford sank 1.9%. Alphabet (GOOGL), which owns autonomous-leader Waymo, rose 0.2%. Intel advanced 0.9%. Tesla (TSLA), poised to reveal quarterly production and delivery numbers in the coming week, fell 2%.Companies testing AVs range from GM and Tesla to driverless-car startup nuTonomy, which was bought by auto supplier Delphi, now Aptiv (APTV), in 2017.Notable AV investments include GM's $1 billion purchase of Cruise Automation in 2016 and Intel's $15 billion acquisition of Mobileye, an Israeli computer vision expert, last year. Now GM is said to be considering a Cruise IPO.The No. 1 U.S. automaker plans to launch a commercial robotaxi service next year.

GM has said its driverless-car service will deliver 20%-30% margins by 2025.But GM, Waymo and other would-be robotaxi service providers must overcome riders' safety concerns.

490,KEY,"In the battle for investment survival, you can learn a lot from judo. The first and most important lesson in that martial art is the same for the stock market: damage control.Judo masters begin not by learning how to throw, but how to fall. They practice this skill until it's as natural as breathing. No matter how many times they're flipped, they can rise to fight again.Highly successful stock pickers go through similar training: They must learn how to cut their losses short. This means selling a stock when it's down 7% or 8% from your purchase price.Sounds simple, but many investors have learned the hard way how difficult it is to master the most important rule in investing.No one wants to sell for a loss. It's an admission that you made a mistake. But if you can set your ego aside, you can take a small loss and still be fit enough, both financially and mentally, to invest the next day. Cutting losses quickly prevents you from suffering a devastating fall that's too steep to recover from.Consider the math. Say you buy a stock at 50. For whatever reason, it drops 8% to 46 during the next few days. You promptly unload it and move on. To reclaim that loss, you need to make an 8.7% gain on your next purchase with your remaining capital, which shouldn't be hard to do.What if you hold on?You're sure the stock will snap back. Your research convinces you it's worth $100, so why get scared by a minor setback?There's one problem. The market doesn't care who you are, what you think or how much you believe in a stock. It says you miscalculated, at least in the short term — a message that gets louder as the stock drops 25% to 37-1/2. To get back even, now you need a 33% gain, which is much tougher to come by than that easy 8.7%.What if the market really doesn't like your stock and slices it in half to 25? You don't need a calculator for this one: To recover a 50% loss requires a 100% gain. How many stocks did you pick last year that doubled in price?If you limit losses on initial purchases to 7% or 8%, you can stay out of trouble, even if only 1 out of 4 buys delivers a modest profit of 25% or 30%. You can be wrong 3 out of every 4 times and still live to invest another day.A .250 batting average is nothing to crow about. But even the best hitters in baseball fail more than they succeed. Consider Tony Gwynn, who in 1999 became the 21st member of pro baseball's 3,000-hit club. That year, the former San Diego Padres outfielder finished the season with a batting average of .338. That means he was coming up empty nearly 2 out of 3 times at the plate.You won't see Gwynn fret after grounding out. The same is true for successful investors. They calmly take a small loss and look for the next potential winner.So leave your emotions behind. Cutting losses with discipline will help keep your head clear when it's time to return to the market. A great paradox of investing is that the ripest buying opportunities occur just after bear markets — when the major stock averages have declined 20% or more.That's exactly when most investors who haven't cut their losses are reeling and don't want to be hit again. It's hard to think straight after losing thousands of dollars. But the market always recovers. What kind of shape will you be in?(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the Aug. 23, 1999, edition of IBD. Gwynn's last season was in 2001. His career batting average held at .338, according to Baseball-Reference.com.

492,KEY,"Investors met Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) with ""rousing applause"" Tuesday after the biotech company presented data from a gene therapy that could help young boys with a muscle-wasting disease.Sarepta tested its gene therapy, called micro-dystrophin, in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients ages 4 to 7. Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz called the data a ""home run."" On average, the three patients showed an 87% reduction of an enzyme tied to the disease by day 60.The data far outstripped analysts' expectations. Sarepta stock ended the day at a record high, up 36.8%, at 143.93. In earlier action on the stock market today, shares bounded as high as 176.50. This helped the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3X (LABU) exchange-traded fund to fly 4.6%, to 107.68. Biotech stocks advanced 1.8%.Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe form of muscular dystrophy that mostly affects boys. In general, patients suffer progressive and irreversible muscle damage. By their teen years, patients often become unable to walk. The condition generally also affects the heart and lungs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We note the data was met with gasps, rousing applause, and to add additional drama to the event, the surprise appearance of all three treated children walking to the stage to a standing ovation by the investor/analyst audience,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report to clients.Sarepta presented the data during its R&D Day. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is tied to mutations in the gene that makes dystrophin. Dystrophin is a key protein in muscle fiber integrity and function. The treatment aims to boost the amount of micro-dystrophin in patients' muscles.By one measure, patients reached an average of 38.2%-53.7% micro-dystrophin levels compared to normal levels. This beat the biotech company's guidance for 5%-10% and the 10% analysts expected for a ""potentially successful"" gene therapy, Abrahams wrote.Leerink's Schwartz said 15% micro-dystrophin levels would be a home run and saw north of 50% as possible. But the biotech company beat both viewpoints. This ""should position Sarepta as a leader in this field,"" he said in a report.On another measure, average gene expression — or measuring the ability of a gene to produce dystrophin — was 76.2%. The average intensity of positive micro-dystrophin fibers was 74.5%. Sarepta had guided to 10% positive fibers and analysts predicted 30% would be successful, RBC's Abrahams said.The treatment also cut the levels of creatine kinase by an average 87% at day 60. Creatine kinase is an enzyme associated with muscle damage. Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy generally have high levels of the enzyme. A fourth patient had his level drop to almost normal, analysts said.Sarepta noted there were no serious adverse events in the study. Two patients had elevated levels of an enzyme that can cause damage to the liver or bile ducts. Physicians increased patients' steroid levels to resolve the issue. Doctors also treated increased nausea with steroids.""Wrapping up the presentation, the three boys marched up to the front of the room to a standing ovation,"" JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko said in a report. She also noted ""a video of boys showed improved stair climbing and running.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

493,KEY,"A quiet sea change is underway in U.S. defense procurement, one that has vast implications for innovative tech firms around the country.For the first time in a long time, the Pentagon is seeking to aggressively tap the expertise of companies well outside the circle of contractors that have provided the technological advantage to America's military.This effort is driven by the understanding that in an era of rapid technological change, some of the greatest advances that would benefit the armed forces are occurring in the commercial sector. The stepped-up interest is a potential benefit to the bottom line for thousands of U.S. companies that might not have otherwise considered the Defense Department a viable market.The allure of nondefense companies is not new. Defense and Congress every few years call for greater use of commercial capabilities. But the extent of the renewed vigor is sky-high, coming from both ends of Pennsylvania Ave. — from a White House intent on cutting regulations and a Congress intent on reforming Pentagon procurement.It is underpinned by a congressionally mandated panel of contracting experts that examined how to make the military's vast and glacial procurement system more effective and efficient. The experts reported back last year, telling lawmakers that the traditional coterie of defense companies is no longer sufficient to keep the U.S. in the technological lead when facing potential enemies.""The defense industrial base has changed, and to maintain technological advantage, DoD increasingly must leverage the commercial marketplace. To be successful in this broader marketplace requires a fundamental change in the DoD-commercial relationship. DoD must become an attractive customer with which commercial firms want to do business,"" they wrote.The press for widening the circle of defense companies comes at a critical period for the U.S. military — as it is facing dramatically rising threats from Russia and China, two nations with a voracious appetite for new technology and that cast a wide net for any advantage.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The competitive military advantage we enjoy today is the result of capabilities developed by our services in an era of unchallenged technological dominance. That era has now passed,"" Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told a congressional panel in May.To reach companies that don't typically do business with the Department of Defense, the Pentagon is turning to a funding mechanism known as ""Other Transaction Authority,"" or OTA.OTA is designed to jump-start the slow technology-buying process and rapidly develop prototypes for assessment by the military services. The speed is generated by slashing the Pentagon's legendary red tape, and efficiency is gained by testing technology before buying it. OTA projects provide greater flexibility than typical government procurements, and they are very welcoming of companies that have no history working with the Department of Defense. A research and prototyping project can be shepherded through the acquisition process and funded in about two months, where it could take well over a year if managed through the usual wickets.Use of OTA in the Department of Defense has increased fivefold since 2012, says Stan Soloway, a former deputy undersecretary for defense, from $400 million to approximately $2 billion last year. The current year is expected to continue that upward trend.While still a drop in the bucket compared with the annual Pentagon budget of approximately $700 billion, the increasing reliance on OTA highlights its value for a military eager to mine the full spectrum of the commercial sector.So how to best employ the OTA mechanism? An important aspect is having the armed forces look well beyond Silicon Valley to other technology centers in the U.S.That's a key reason why the U.S. Army, for example, in search of simulation, gaming and augmented-reality/virtual-reality systems to improve its training of soldiers, recently held an industry day in Austin, Texas. The event attracted nontraditional defense companies, large and small. They ranged from sizable companies such as Dell and Accenture, to small Austin-area startups such as Offworld Industries and iTexico.A second aspect is creating the right environment to bridge the cultural gap between the public and private sectors. The Defense Department can bring new meaning to the word ""byzantine."" So companies with innovative technology that have never before worked with the armed services require mentorship to ensure the partnership is fruitful. The goal should be to make the partnership easy for the innovator and the contracting office, while boosting the capabilities of U.S. forces as rapidly as practical.Potential adversaries have greater access to emerging commercial technologies than ever before, posing a serious threat to national security. OTA will allow the U.S. to tap the technological prowess of U.S. commercial firms, while making Pentagon procurement reform a reality.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

The focus is on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and whether public Facebook statements have been truthful.Facebook stock rose 1.6% to 197.36 in Monday's stock market trading. That's at the edge of a 5% chase zone from a 188.42 buy point.Tesla stock action Monday offered a trio of key investing lessons.Be wary of overnight trading: Trading after the close and before the open often doesn't translate into how a stock will close in the next session. Tesla rose more 6% than in premarket trade and shortly after the opening bell. That came on news that Tesla Model 3 production topped 5,000 in the last week of June, the first time the electric vehicle maker hit that weekly milestone. But Tesla stock quickly pared gains, and by the close fell 2.3% to 335.07. Some analysts wondered if Tesla Model 3 output was sustainable.Likewise, Dow Jones futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures all pointed lower before Monday open, but the actual indexes rallied for slim-to-solid gains.For what it's worth, Tesla stock fell 0.9% in Tuesday's premarket.Good news sometimes spurs selling: ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" is an old stock market saying that doesn't always hold up. But the stock market does a good job of pricing in good news, especially if that news is expected. Tesla stock had rallied strongly in late May to June 18 as CEO Elon Musk predicted Model 3 output would hit 5,000 in the last week of June.Given that Musk's promises often don't hold up, it wasn't surprising to see Tesla stock rally early Monday. But ultimately the ""sell the news"" trend took hold.Wait for a proper buy point: Even at the Tesla stock intraday peak of 364.78, it was still well below a 373.83 handle buy point. When a stock clears a buy point, the odds are high that it will rise, and rise strongly. That's no guarantee, but you make big money bets when the odds are in your favor.Tesla stock also reflects a fourth investing lesson over the long run.Focus on the very best stocks: Tesla has a Composite Rating of just 38 out of a possible 99. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs. That reflects Tesla's significant losses and recent poor, sluggish share price performance. Tesla's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging for nearly a year. The RS line really hasn't made headway for more than four years.Obviously, Tesla stock has been a big winner, from its April 2013 breakout to the end of February 2014. Perhaps the company is turning the corner in terms of production and cash burn. If so, the stock may be a big winner. But investors generally should focus on the best of the best of the best.Pivotal Software is a Dell spinoff. Its cloud-based service helps companies streamline software development and manage apps. Huya, a spinoff of YY (YY), is the leading Chinese streaming site for video games. IQiyi, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, is called the ""Netflix of China.""Pivotal stock is finding support right at its 20-day line after the April IPO blasted higher in early June but then pulled back.The Chinese livestreaming IPOs have been consolidating for a few days before their 20-day lines, after significant pullbacks. Huya stock and iQiyi stock had skyrocketed in June, becoming sharply extended from their 10-day moving lines. That made a near-term retreat likely.On Monday, Pivotal stock rose 1.8% to 24.70. iQiyi stock rose 1.55% to 32.80. Huya stock sank 2.4% to 32.10, but held above a recent near-term low and closed near session highs.Early Tuesday, iQiyi stock and Huya stock rose 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Pivotal stock was not yet active.But it's early days for these stocks. Just because a stock has stopped falling for a few days, or even begun to move higher, doesn't mean it's a buy. Wait for a stock to consolidate and blast out of a new buy point.Just look at Brazilian IPO PagSeguro (PAGS). The payments stock rocketed from early February to late March. Then shares pulled back to the 50-day line and tried to bounce back. But within a few days PagSeguro stock broke down sharply. In late May, shares reclaimed their 50-day moving average, but not for long.

503,KEY,"U.S. manufacturing expanded more than forecast last month as a gauge of supplier-delivery times shot up amid robust orders and production, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed on Monday.The factory index climbed 1.5 points to 60.2, matching the second-highest since 2004 and beating estimates for a dip to 58.2. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.The supplier deliveries gauge jumped 6.2 points to 68.2, the second- highest since April 1979. The subindex shows lead times increasing as producers have trouble meeting demand.The new orders index dipped 0.2 point to a still-robust 63.5. The production gauge rose to 62.3 from 61.5.While indexes of orders, production and factory employment remained elevated, the ISM's main gauge of June factory activity was inflated by a surge in the group's measure of supplier deliveries, indicating lengthening lead times.The delays potentially reflect purchasing managers' efforts to acquire materials ahead of President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on Chinese products, which would follow levies on steel and aluminum from around the world. Such demand, coming on top of steady consumption and business investment, is testing capacity limits of both manufacturers and the transportation sector.""Lead-time extensions, steel and aluminum disruptions, supplier labor issues, and transportation difficulties continue,"" Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM Business Survey Committee, said in a statement. ""Demand remains robust, but the nation's employment resources and supply chains continue to struggle. Respondents are overwhelmingly concerned about how tariff related activity is and will continue to affect their business.""Supply-chain disruptions are also helping to push up input prices. The ISM's latest measure of costs of raw and other materials used in manufacturing fell in June but remained close to a seven-year high.Employment gauge was little changed at 56 after 56.3. Index of factory order backlogs fell to 60.1 from 63.5. Measure of export orders increased to 56.3 from 55.6.

516,KEY,"The big banks have their tax cuts, a good economy and higher interest rates. They also dumped a whole bunch of extra returns on shareholders last month. But as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) prepare to report second-quarter earnings on Friday, big bank stocks have been in a mass slide lower.XDread over a flattening yield curve, and its potential foreshadowing of a recession, has crept into bank stocks this year. Lending has picked up. But it remains slow overall, and businesses are still skittish about borrowing money to expand. The Trump administration is flinging tariffs at China and criticizing NAFTA, adding to businesses' ambivalence. Deposit costs are rising, crimping profits.""We had a benefit from corporate tax reform that was good for a lot of these companies, and there isn't a lot of evidence that they've invested very much in their businesses,"" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said.He said Q2 bank earnings this month will likely be more defined by management's outlook for the rest of the year, as banks — and their large and small clients — assess whether a strong U.S. economy can stomach a trade war.Keefe-Bruyette & Woods forecasts median second-quarter loan growth of 2.8% for JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America (BAC).

Analysts see revenue up 8% to $27.54 billion.Also expected: CEO Jamie Dimon, who missed JPMorgan's first-quarter earnings call in April, will be in attendance. Dimon often uses the bank's quarterly earnings to weigh in on the economy and Washington. His reflections on the economy in earnings releases and annual shareholder letters have the feel of a Warren Buffet-esque fireside chat. His remarks on earnings calls? Not always so much.""He has the potential to create some fireworks here,"" Shanahan said of Dimon.

Earlier that month, Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders that ""anything that starts to resemble a trade war creates risk and uncertainty to the global economic system.""The Trump administration this week said it planned to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products.

That's essentially where the stock was at the beginning of the year.At the core of investors' anxiety over the banks is the yield curve, which measures the difference between rates on short-term and long-term government debt. The yield curve is also a reflection on investors' longer-term expectations of inflation and the strength of an economy able to get away with higher prices.Short-term rates influence the rates at which banks borrow money from depositors. The long end influences the rates they set on money they lend to others. Banks' margins depend on the gap between those two.The Fed has bumped up short-term rates, in turn pushing up what banks can charge on things like credit-card and auto loans. But the long end has wavered, reflecting a dimmer view of the economy further out.Citigroup is expected to report a 23% increase in EPS to $1.56, as revenue increases 3% to $18.46 billion.The bank is the most internationally exposed of the big banks, drawing only half of its revenue from North America last year, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Fourteen percent came from Latin America.Citigroup has been bullish on business prospects in Mexico, saying in April that it expected ""continued revenue growth"" in the nation. Citi at that time also noted ""momentum"" in its card and retail banking businesses there.Mexico, however, this month elected as president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a staunch leftist who rode a populist, anti-establishment wave to victory. He has called Trump ""erratic and arrogant."" But after his election win, he said he would aim for ""friendly relations"" with the U.S. Obrador has also said he wants Mexico to stay in NAFTA.KBW last month also noted that Citigroup, at a recent conference, said ""the economy (in Mexico) could slow either on the back of no NAFTA or renegotiated NAFTA or an outcome of a presidential election on July 1.""

""This step-up should produce revenue in Year 1 (4Q19-3Q20) of approximately $400mn, up 170% from $150mn in the last year of the prior contract.""While Handler is holding a 68 price target for now, he said a valuation move towards 100 per share following adjustments is beginning to look ""very reasonable.""KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Evan Wingren also said the new TV rights came in above revised expectations. He also believes there is still more potential upside from the stock.""With successful renewals in the United States under its belt, and likely more to come, we believe WWE is in the process of being re-rated to reflect the dramatic changes of its brand and profitability profile,"" Wingren said in a research note. ""The terminal implications imply that with execution, WWE has the potential to invest and set itself up for even more lucrative TV renewals and accelerate international (internet media) growth.""The move to network TV with Fox will be exciting news for fans of the ""sport,"" in which oiled, muscle-bound men, and some women, parade around in tight outfits and pretend to fight each other.""SmackDown Live"" is the second-longest running weekly episodic cable TV show in U.S. prime-time history. It is second only to stablemate ""Monday Night Raw,"" which has aired over 1,300 episodes to date.Subscriptions have also increased for WWE's digital streaming service. This is a big part of the company's move to stay relevant to cord-cutters.Back in April, the company said subscriptions to WWE Network hit a record 2.12 million subscribers following April 8's ""WrestleMania,"" the event that often marks the annual boiling point for WWE's drama. That 2.12 million figure was up 9% on April 3, 2017, following last year's ""WrestleMania.""And in May the firm forecast a ""meaningful increase"" in second-quarter sales due to new content distributed internationally.WWE has successfully undertaken a move from its wrestling roots to movies, publishing, music, online streaming and various other business ventures.

527,KEY,"IBD's Dividend Leaders screen often unearths stocks prone to hold their ground when the market turns rough. Gas pipeline operator Oneok (OKE) is a dividend stock that fits the bill.The Tulsa, Okla.-based company projects 9% to 11% annual dividend growth through 2021. The consensus estimate sees earnings accelerating to triple-digit growth in the second quarter. And the stock is trade war-resistant, unshaken by the market's recent volatility and up 13% from an early May breakout.Oneok (pronounced one-oak) operates pipelines that gather raw natural gas directly from production areas. Its fractionation facilities divide that into natural gas (methane) and related natural gas liquids (pentane, butane, ethane). It then directs those separate products to various markets, distributors and customers via pipelines that it and other operators own.Oneok is a leading player across the Rocky Mountain region, the Oklahoma-Texas panhandle area the energy industry calls the midcontinent, and the bustling Permian Basin in west Texas. Recovering energy demand in the U.S. and overseas continues to boost demand for oil.Rising oil production leads to increasing supplies of natural gas.Oil wells produce varying levels of natural gas and natural gas liquids. Traditionally, those byproducts were ""flared off"" — vented to create a gas torch constantly burning over an oil well. Environmental regulations have begun to clamp down on the practice.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut still, Bloomberg reports that 15% of natural gas produced in North Dakota was flared off in April. That 15% limit decreases to 12% in November and 9% in 2020. At the same time, production is rising. The combination mean more gas lines are needed, and Oneok is among the leaders working to put more ""take-away"" capacity in place in the Williston and Powder River Basins, which include the Bakken and Niobrara shale fields.Oneok was also among the large group of pipeline operations that first broke off physical assets into a master limited partnership, Oneok Partners. Used as a vehicle to generate high cash flow payouts — both to the company and to investors — the industrywide scheme ran up against problems as the spun off companies maxed out their payments to their parent companies.Oneok then followed the industry's reverse trend: parents buying back their master limited partnership spinouts. Oneok announced in February last year that it had arranged a $9.3 billion stock deal to regain full ownership of Oneok Partners. The deal, completed in June, 2017, enabled Oneok to boost its dividend 21%.The downside is debt. The all-stock deal avoided ratcheting up Oneok's debt load. But the company still reported $8.52 billion in long-term debt at the end of 2017. That gave it a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 146%. That's well within the bounds of its peers, but still meant Oneok paid interest on long-term debt of $436.1 million for the year.Oneok's annual earnings have been up and down over the past four years.

On Monday, shares gained 1.6% to close at 197.36 on the stock market today.Facebook's data breach involved research firm Cambridge Analytica and its access to personal information from 87 million users of the social network. The breach seeped its way into the U.S. presidential election of 2016, due to its connection with alleged Russian meddling.In subsequent congressional hearings, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was dragged before both House and Senate panels, giving 10 hours worth of testimony. Since then, Facebook has faced a storm of criticism from users, advertisers and regulators over the past few months, both in the U.S. and Europe.Facebook's troubles helped spur the European Union into implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, which created data protection rules across Europe. It took effect in May, and Facebook and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit already have complied.But it has also raised a question as to whether digital advertising revenue at Facebook and Google will be impacted long-term by a regulatory wave in Europe and in the U.S.""It's created some disruption but I think the bark is worse than the bite,"" said GBH's Ives. Ives has a rating of highly attractive on Facebook stock and price target of 225.Whatever troubles Facebook is facing hasn't slowed its consistent pace of double-digit growth in revenue and earnings. Facebook's first-quarter revenue jumped 49% from the year-ago period to $11.96 billion, along with 63% growth in earnings per share.For the second quarter, analysts are looking for Facebook to report revenue growth of 43% to $13.3 billion. They also see 30% growth in earnings per share.Working in Facebook's favor is its massive size. It has 2.2 billion monthly active users, one-third of the world's global population. That's up 14% from the same period a year ago. About 1.45 billion people log on daily, spending an average of 20 minutes per visit.Put it all together and Facebook has enormous influence among advertisers, which account for about 96% of its revenue. Facebook's clout, resulting from the large amount of data it has on users, is matched only by Google. Combined, the two rake in about 60% of digital advertising spending. That includes Alphabet's YouTube.Other social networking sites, including Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), Pinterest and Yelp (YELP) have hardly put a dent in Facebook's armor.All this is occurring while Facebook stock still has several revenue-growth levers to pull. Its biggest ace-in-the-hole right now is Instagram, the photo- and video-sharing mobile platform that just surpassed 1 billion users. Compare that with Snap's Snapchat, which had 191 million users at the end of the first quarter.Facebook has steadily monetized Instagram with ads. The company does not break out Instagram revenue. It is, however, seen by analysts as a core revenue driver with a lot of room to accelerate.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves believes ad revenue will more than double from a year ago to $8.9 billion. By 2020, he thinks Instagram will account for 26% of Facebook's total revenue.""As core Facebook matures, Instagram is the key to the next leg of growth,"" Hargreaves wrote in a report to clients this month. He has an overweight rating on Facebook and price target of 245.""Facebook continues to grow its core user base and increase the effectiveness of its advertising offerings, which, when combined with a massive opportunity to grow Instagram and monetize its messaging products, we believe creates a substantial opportunity for future growth for many years,"" he wrote.Another growth lever is the Facebook Messenger platform.This past month, analysts have spotted some of the first advertisements on Messenger. That includes ads from Staples, Uber and Peloton.""Just in the last two weeks we have seen consistent ads in Facebook Messenger for the first time,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a June 19 note to clients. Facebook Messenger has 1.3 billion monthly active users.Mahaney thinks Messenger could contribute $6 billion to $8 billion in revenue. That translates into $1 in earnings per share to the company by 2020. He has an outperform rating on Facebook and price target of 250.Another future growth lever is Facebook's other messaging platform, WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion users.There is one overhang out there that analysts are watching closely. The issue is whether younger users are abandoning the platform for social apps considered more ""cool,"" or other reasons. It's already happening, but not to a level that has yet threatened the stock, GBH's Ives says.Facebook had dominated the social media landscape among America's youth. But it no longer is the most popular online platform among teens, a recent Pew Research Center survey said. In a survey on Facebook and teenage usage, about half of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 say they use Facebook, but they use YouTube, Instagram or Snapchat more often, in that order.Notably, it said 95% of those teens have a smartphone, with almost half saying they ""almost constantly"" use the internet. That's a big pool of advertising opportunity.""That's been a challenging demographic for them and speaks to why the Instagram acquisition will go down as one of Zuckerberg's best moves in the evolution of Facebook,"" said Ives. ""What Instagram has done is put a competitive moat around that demographic.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Mark Zuckerberg, The Facebook Data Breach And The Dark Side Of Social MediaFacebook's Zuckerberg Admits Big Mistake, Apologizes For ScandalFacebook Rejects Claims In New York Times Story About User Data AbuseFor First Time, Facebook Seen Losing Youth Audience To Snapchat

530,KEY,"Can the future really be female if an unspoken gender gap keeps quietly eating away at women's futures? While women have been shown to outperform men at investing, they tend to shun the stock market for the deceptive safety of cash savings, leaving men to reap the gains — and keep a grip on the world's private wealth.This disconnect between women and Wall Street runs deep. Hollywood portrayals only underscore the divide, from the chest-thumping boys' club in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" to ""Sex and the City"" heroine Carrie Bradshaw. As she once said about investing, in a phrase that launched a thousand Etsy posters: ""I like my money right where I can see it — hanging in my closet.""In the real world, millennial women in particular are financially vulnerable. The investing gender gap can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime. That means the difference between being in control of the future and being swept away by the undercurrent of daily expenses.""One thing we realize more than ever these days is that money is power. And that if you don't have as much money as the guys do, it can put you in a tough position,"" says Sallie Krawcheck, CEO of investing platform Ellevest. ""It can keep you in a job you don't want to do. It can keep you in a relationship you don't want to be in. It can keep you from taking that trip around the world, or starting the business you've been dreaming about.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCompared with the average single man, the average single woman's net worth is three times smaller, according to a joint study from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave.Pay equity is part of the equation, compounded by the fact that women are more likely to pause their careers to raise children and take care of aging parents and spouses. Compared with a man with no workforce interruptions, the average woman cumulatively has earned $1.06 million less by the time she hits retirement age.""Women, generally, we're leaning in to our careers and we're becoming much more comfortable around being ambitious professionally. But we're not having that same dynamic (with our money),"" says Jennifer Barrett, a former CNBC personal finance editor and the current editor-in-chief of Grow, a web publication from micro-investing app Acorns. ""It's to our detriment if we don't invest.""No matter where you look, the numbers are pretty straightforward: Compared with men, women are tepid about the stock market. Some 57% of women didn't invest a dime in 2017, vs. 44% of men, according to a recent Acorns study. If handed a thousand bucks, 2.5 times more men than women said they would put that money in stocks. Women also lag men in 401(k) participation and contribution, says the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.Some women are already feeling the fear of missing out.The Merrill Lynch/Age Wave study found that 41% of women said their greatest financial regret was not investing more of their money. That even trumps career, credit-card and lifestyle woes.Thirty-year-old Caroline Rhoads, an account director at a marketing firm in Philadelphia, said Wall Street ""seems very intimidating.""She has consulted a financial planner once, invested around $1,000 through a Robinhood account, and feels good about her 401(k) and financial future. But she invests conservatively, ""because I feel like if I'm going to invest I need to know what I'm doing, and I don't.""Bridging the investing gender gap may seem abstract and distant, particularly for 20-something women mired in student debt, decades away from retirement. But there are serious consequences for not at least trying to get the ball rolling.""In not being comfortable investing, what you're saying is you're not comfortable building wealth,"" says Barrett. And the gender gap there is ""growing, not shrinking, even as women are earning more and closing the wage gap. We still have a gaping wealth gap.""If it's so important, why is there a dearth of female investors? What accounts for this gender gap in the market? More than a couple of things, it turns out.Think back to ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's testosterone-fueled, Martin Scorsese-directed yacht parties, filled with models and bottles. And earlier this year, an E-Trade Financial (ETFC) ad showed men cavorting with bikini-clad women on a yacht. Who wouldn't want to be associated with that lifestyle?Uh, women.""I can't help but equate Wall Street with the a**hole bros filling lower Manhattan bars most nights, who drink too much, act rudely toward women, and generally behave badly,"" wrote Refinery29's Work & Money Director Lindsey Stanberry in a 2016 story on how to invest. ""Do I really want to put my hard-earned money in their hands? (No.)""Ellevest's Krawcheck says the fact that the investing gender gap even exists ""tells me that women are not being well served by the existing investing industry and by Wall Street.""She should know. Her Wall Street cred includes stints as the head of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup's (C) wealth management divisions. Now she is a vocal proponent of something she calls ""financial feminism,"" or wealth equality between men and women.And no, the solution isn't slapping a bunch of pink labels on existing financial products. Of her days at the heavyweights, Krawcheck said efforts to appeal to female investors didn't consider their financial desires.Ellevest's ""gender-aware"" investing algorithms, she says, consider key differences about women. Their salaries peak sooner than men's. They earn less over their lifetimes. They are more likely than men to outlive their resources.So she aims to help investors reach their goals, not beat the market. Wall Street's obsession with outperforming the stock market indexes ""leaves women completely cold,"" she says.Female investors are more interested in reaching certain milestones, such as retiring at a certain income, buying a home or starting a business, she adds.And she's quick to dismiss the notion that women's risk aversion toward stocks drives the investing gender gap.""It's not that she's risk averse, she's risk aware. And the industry has done a poor job explaining risk to her,"" said Krawcheck of female investors. ""When she understands it, she's happy to take it.""But it's true that women are doing less with their money. Financial services startup SoFi found that men contribute 32% more to their investment accounts than women do, and tend to invest more aggressively.Meanwhile, women are equally or more confident than men in paying bills and setting budgets. But they're far less confident about managing their investments, say Merrill Lynch/Age Wave researchers.Maybe that's why female investors keep more of their money in cash. According to an oft-cited BlackRock study from 2015, female investors keep 68% of their portfolios in cash vs. men's 59%.The apparent safety of a savings account, however, is deceptive. Over the long run, hoarding cash is a terrible way to increase net worth. Consider the math: Interest rates on savings are near zero while inflation is now 2%, which means that $1,000 in the bank today is objectively worth less in the future.Additionally, it pays to take advantage of compounding interest.Say you invest $500 tomorrow in a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500. Then add 50 bucks to that account every month thereafter. Say it grows by an average 8% every year. (Over the last 90 years, the average yearly return for the S&P 500 has been 9.8%, even accounting for crashes.) In 30 years, a no-interest savings account would have grown to $18,500. Your investment in the stock market would have amassed $73,001.26.Still, that's easier said than done for those who don't trust Wall Street. There's a whole generation of women and men who remain deeply distrustful of the stock market. Both the dot-com crash and the Great Recession blindsided them in their formative years.""In a short period of time, they saw two recessions and two market meltdowns,"" says Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride. ""Those memories are fresh. So a lot of (millennials) just never warmed up to equities and have taken a naturally risk-averse stance, detrimental though that may be to their long-term financial health.""Younger people prefer real estate and cash over the stock market, according to Bankrate surveys. And millennial women in particular are in a financially precarious position.""Here's my concern, and it's heightened for millennial women,"" says McBride. ""Millennials are going to have the biggest retirement savings burden in history,"" thanks to longer life spans, fewer pensions, more uncertainty around Social Security, and higher health costs than any generation before them. And holding on to safe-haven assets like gold, he says, is not going to cut it.""To accumulate retirement savings, you need the power of compounding to do the heavy lifting.""Michelle Trejo, a 29-year-old quality assurance engineer in Los Angeles, says that her main vehicle for retirement is her 401(k), though she isn't sure how much she's contributing. Once she saves more money, she is looking to invest in real estate, and then potentially in the stock market.""I wish I knew how to play (the stock market),"" says Trejo, who has dabbled in cryptocurrencies, a far higher-risk investment than stocks. ""I know there's a lot of money there. I just don't know how to get started.""Some experts venture that women get a one-sided directive about what to do with their money: Spend it.""Generally speaking, if you look at who's spending money on clothes and keeping up with the trends,"" says Barrett, ""it's not men. It's women.""Think about how many magazines or style blogs talk about buying ""investment pieces"": a classic necklace, a blazer that will never go out of style. An analysis from purse reseller Baghunter will have you believe that a Birkin bag from Hermes is a better purchase than gold. Of course, that assumes you hold on to the bag for 35 years and keep it in mint condition.""When we talk about buying a handbag as an investment, it makes me cringe,"" said Barrett.That mindset extends beyond the investing gender gap to the venture-capital world.Men with wealth are encouraged to amass more wealth, said The Helm CEO and co-founder Lindsey Taylor Wood at the recent United State of Women conference. Her venture fund invests in female entrepreneurs.""Their buddies are like, 'Get in on this deal, invest in this company, buy this stock,' "" she said. By contrast, ""women with wealth are invited to give their money away. 'Chair this gala, join this nonprofit, be on this board.' ""A notable 61% of women would rather chat about their own death (!) than talk about money, according to Merrill Lynch/Age Wave data.""In our society, talking about money is pretty taboo for women; we learn this from childhood,"" says Ellevest's Krawcheck. ""If you're not talking about money, how do you know what raise to ask for, or how to invest? The answer is: You don't. And women are the poorer for it.""That deep-rooted behavior is encoded early on. In fact, 63% of millennial women vs. 53% of their male peers learned from their parents about saving money at an early age, according to a recent PNC Investments survey. But only 29% of those same women said their parents showed them how to grow wealth, vs. 37% of men.""(There are the) stories that we tell ourselves and the stories that we've heard and internalize,"" says Acorns' Barrett, who is writing a book about the wealth gender gap. ""That investing is hard, that you need to be wealthy to invest. Women in particular get that message a lot. And if you look at the research — even the way parents talk to their sons and daughters about money is different.""Kathy Mirescu, a 40-year-old director of product design, is far from the norm when it comes to enthusiasm for personal finance. It is a quality the Los Angeles resident learned from her mother, a self-taught commercial real estate investor with an accounting background who ""was always looking for investment opportunities and would talk about them"" openly with her three children.""I just grew up not really thinking about it, until I became a lot older, and I started realizing that a lot of my friends, a lot of my peers, who are college educated — a lot of them have advanced degrees — didn't know a lot of the things that I just knew"" about finance, said Mirescu.She bought her own condo at just 29. The down payment came from cash and proceeds from the sale of blue chip stocks that her mother bought for her early on in life.Now Mirescu wants to start an investing club that will help her friends and other women become more financially literate. ""To just simply have a place where we all get in a room,"" she said, and ""help each other set up Roth IRAs.""Acorns' survey found that 42% of women chose Oprah as the person they'd be most likely to take investing advice from. More than half of men chose Warren Buffett.That likely speaks more to women's trust in Oprah than the gender gap, says Barrett. But it also serves to highlight how few female investors are well known on Wall Street.""If you think about really famous investors — can you think of a woman?"" she said. ""We don't have a lot of female role models."" (According to the Merrill study, 45% of women don't have a financial role model, to be exact.)Krawcheck, who took the stage at the United State of Women conference to hearty applause, is an emerging rock star in the realm of financial feminism. At the mention of the Ellevest founder, Mirescu starts ""fan-girling."" (Her words.)She, too, sees money as a ""feminist issue.""""It's about having choices, and money gives you the freedom to have choices,"" says Mirescu.

531,KEY,"Netflix (NFLX) and Square (SQ) are clear stock market leaders, with both extending gains Wednesday to hit new all-time highs. But if you have a position in one of these surging top stocks, you might consider locking in some of those gains – even with Netflix stock up 2.9% and Square stock up 2.5% in the stock market today.Video streaming giant Netflix is up a whopping 117% so far in 2018, while Square has surged 97%. Not only do these all-star stocks have strong technical action, their fundamentals are equally strong.While Netflix and Square still have compelling growth stories, the extended nature of their stocks may warrant taking some profits.FANG stock Netflix is now extended 23% past the 338.92 flat-base buy point cleared on May 23, after reaching the 20% profit milestone in Tuesday's session.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSquare stock is nearing a profit zone, with a 15% gain from a cup-base buy point of 58.56. A slightly earlier handle entry, which is technically too short and doesn't show up on the weekly chart, puts the stock at a 19% gain from a 57.29 buy point.It's important to note that both of these bases are late-stage bases, further underscoring the huge moves these hot tech stocks have already seen. Late-stage bases can work, but are more prone to failure.We identify the profit-taking zone as a 20%-25% gain from a buy point. The rule states that once a stock becomes this far extended past a proper entry, that's usually a good time to sell part of your position to secure some gains.Investors may want to take partial profits at this stage because our research shows that top stocks typically pull back once reaching these levels.Square stock, for instance, gained 22% from a cup-with-handle breakout in March, and then the stock dropped as much as 23% before starting to rebound higher.And Netflix stock pulled back as much as 18% after a powerful breakout in January before continuing its move higher – though the stock gained some 40% from the buy point before that correction.The latter is an example of why you wouldn't want to sell your entire position simply because the stock hits that 20% profit mark. Make sure to look at other key indicators, such as price and volume action and broader market conditions, when making buying and selling decisions.Taking profits all comes down to your level of conviction in a stock, and whether you're willing to sit through declines in order to give winning stocks room to run. But sticking to buy and sell rules is a sound strategy that helps prevent you from making poor investing decisions. It's key to remember that the bright side of pullbacks is they can result in fresh buying opportunities.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Micron Earnings Lift These 5 Memory-Chip PlaysNetflix Stock Is On Leaderboard, IBD's Curated List Of Leading Growth StocksFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, GoogleThese 2 FANG+ Stocks Are In Buy RangeStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Meanwhile, Google owner Alphabet and PayPal are staging new breakouts, providing growth investors a set of new proper entry points.Alphabet (GOOGL) rose nearly 2% to 1,199.90, clearing a 1,178.26 buy point in a 4-1/2-month double bottom. This is one of the eight key chart patterns that IBD identifies as platforms in which leading stocks jump off and rise into new highs.The 5% buy zone for Alphabet goes up to 1,237.17.As noted in this earlier Stock Market Today column, Alphabet also formed a nice seven-day handle on the double-bottom pattern. This provided a slightly lower entry point at 1,161.20.PayPal (PYPL), noted in today's new IBD Stock of the Day column, rallied 2% to 86.14 and is still in buy range after clearing an 84.09 buy point in its double-bottom base.In a double bottom, a stock suffers two major sell-offs. The second sell-off must be deeper than the first one. In other words, PayPal's low of 70.22 undercut the first low of 71.63. That's good. It means that a strong shakeout of weak holders has occurred.The Nasdaq got as high as 7794, good for a new all-time high.

The stock jumped more than 5% to 67.74 in heavy trade but is more than 19% below 52-week highs. Walgreens also trades beneath its downward-sloping 200-day moving average, a sign of underperformance.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the next-generation payment provider sports a strong Composite Rating of 97 on a scale of 1 to 99.

Eventually, the slice of U.S. imports hit with EU tariffs could more than double.Yet at the same time, German automakers are moving to head off an expanded Trump trade war threat of a 25% tariff on U.S. imports of European cars. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Daimler (DDAIF), BMW (BMWYY) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) have pitched the idea of both sides killing their auto tariffs, which stand at 10% in the EU vs. 2.5% in the U.S. Daimler has good reason to want a deal.Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross responded positively to the idea, but it comes with a big catch: The German automakers also want the U.S. to kill a 25% tax on imports of pickup trucks and SUVs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

540,KEY,"The first half of 2018 has been a dichotomy between the haves and the have-nots among biotech companies, a Wall Street brokerage says.But in this case the haves aren't large-cap biotech companies like Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — all of which have struggled with negative clinical studies or regulatory delays for key drugs. Instead, it's the small- and midcap biotech companies that are leading the pack.RBC Capital Markets analysts call it ""a tale of two biotechs.""Multiples among large-cap biotech companies have slipped and sales projections have taken a beating. Meanwhile, prices for quality assets among small- and midcap biotech companies ""have never been higher and the competition fierce.""""Generalists who are able to hold smaller-cap companies are tending to invest in the (iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB)) rather than just a handful of large-caps,"" RBC wrote in a note to clients this week.

The Street isn't entirely hopeful for one of Biogen's potential Alzheimer's disease treatments. Biogen is developing the drug called BAN2401 with Eisai.At the same time, other potential catalysts have left biotech stocks wanting. Clinical studies from Gilead, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Aimmune Therapeutics (AIMT) were ""anticlimactic,"" RBC analysts wrote.Celgene suffered a massive hit when the Food and Drug Administration delayed its experimental multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.The news is ""fueling continued questions about these companies' abilities to succeed in a second or third 'act' before their cash flows expire from patent cliffs,"" the RBC analysts said.They noted some biotech companies appear to have good launches for new drugs. They list Amgen's (AMGN) migraine prevention treatment Aimovig and Gilead's Biktarvy, an HIV medication. But even those aren't enough to offset underlying revenue issues, analysts say.Investors are seemingly taking a dim view for large-cap biotech stocks.""Our investor survey suggests worsening generalist sentiment with reticence to come back to the space, and our anecdotal feedback suggests frustration with challenges at companies like Celgene has led many to rotate out of the sector, through we sense a few may be looking to dip their toes back in,"" they wrote.However, the small- and midcap space ""could not be behaving more differently.""Innovation in gene therapy and cellular therapy resulted in the acquisitions this year. Novartis (NVS) bought AveXis and Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics.This is helping to send other ""cutting-edge"" biotech stocks like Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) and Sage Therapeutics (SAGE). Sarepta is now flying high on data from its gene therapy in a form of muscular dystrophy. Sage is working on a number of depression drugs.""In fact, 2018 biopharma M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity (in terms of dollars) has nearly tripled that seen up to mid-June 2017,"" the RBC analysts said. ""IPO (initial public offering) and secondary activity has remained vibrant with 23 biotech IPOs so far this year, raising $2.5 billion in aggregate.""Takeouts could occur among small- and midcap biotech companies.

The Russell 2000 dived 0.5%. But the latter has a bigger year-to-date return. The Russell, at 1694, boasts a 10.3% advance. The Dow, at 24,919, is up just 0.8%.Fellow Dow Jones component Microsoft (MSFT) edged up less than 0.2% to 102.01 but is now within spitting distance of hitting new highs.

NYSE volume edged slightly higher, according to early data. Defensive sectors including food and utilities, as well as cyclical groups such as semiconductors, homebuilders, steel and automakers, paced the advance. Roughly eight of IBD's 197 industry groups rose 1% or more. (See the entire list of 197 IBD industries and the six-month relative strength rankings here.)The banking and transport sectors fell, losing some of their recent big gains. The Dow transports fell just 0.3%, but IBD's truck transport industry group skidded 1.7% lower. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) halted a three-day win streak, losing 0.6% to 106.62 and failing to close back above its 200-day line.As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, Apple cleared the 5% buy zone from a 179.04 correct entry in a narrow double bottom.Apple, rising to as high as 191.28 on Wednesday before closing off just 0.1% at 190.35, is now up 6.3% past the proper buy point.

The Nasdaq stock is now up more than 9% past a cup-without-handle entry point of 30.17.Volume zoomed to triple its usual level of 2.1 million shares per day. The stock did suffer a sell signal after falling more than 8% from the entry, yet has recovered.San Francisco-based Stitch Fix notched $977 million in revenue in 2017, up 34%. This year, the Street sees the top line bulging 26% to $1.23 billion, then rising another 20% to $1.47 billion in 2019. However, earnings are seen slipping 41% to 19 cents a share in 2018 and falling another 26% to 14 cents a share in 2019 as the company invests aggressively to expand its services.The company shows excellent operating cash flow, coming in at $1.38 a share in 2017.

Volume surged five times above its 50-day average.For three sessions in a row, the stock tried to clear a 35.28 buy point in a narrow cup with handle. But some funds have used the opportunity to dump shares. Cactus went public at 19 a share on Feb. 8.A good cup with handle typically shows a minimum length of seven weeks. Think of it this way: The left side of the cup may form over three weeks, the right side in three weeks, and a downward-sloping handle over one week. That all adds up to seven weeks.However, IBD research has found that in some rare cases, a stock with extraordinary fundamentals can bolt out of a six-week cup with handle so long as it shows excellent price-volume action, has glowing fundamentals, owns a leadership spot in its industry, and is rising along a confirmed market uptrend.In his 2004 classic, ""The Successful Investor,"" IBD founder Bill O'Neil wrote that the cup with handle ""should be at least six to eight weeks in length, starting with the first week closing down off the stock's top.""On the positive side, the expert in wellheads and oil rig-related gear found buying support near its 50-day moving average. Cactus has rallied as much 97% from its IPO price.Notice how sell-offs in early and mid-June sent the stock briefly below the 50-day moving average.The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) ETF cooled off after rising sharply the past few weeks. The popular exchange-traded fund edged 0.4% lower to 43.97 in quiet trade. EEM is down nearly 7% year to date, hurt in large part by its 32% weighting in China.Notice how EEM posted a key sell signal on Feb. 5 as the ETF sliced through the 50-day moving average in huge volume. EEM eventually tested institutional buying support at the long-term 200-day moving average, bounced sharply and briefly flung above the 50-day line, and tried to build a new base.Yet since March, EEM has continued to struggle as the 50-day line became a level of resistance. The 50-day moving average has also been sliding for more than three months, indicating a negative intermediate-term trend.Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura Securities, noted in a new monthly global economic outlook that his team believes ""global growth has peaked and, as it slows, we are most cautious in EM (emerging markets).""""We are specifically forecasting that global growth will slow from an annual rate of 4.0% in 2018 to 3.7% in 2019,"" he added.RELATED:The IBD Stock Of The DayDividend Stocks: These 6 REITs Crush The Yield Of The S&P 500 by 350%-475%Which 9 Stocks Currently Join IBD Leaderboard?Investor's Corner: Make Sure Every Breakout Has This Vital ElementWhich Way Is The Stock Market Headed?

543,KEY,"Qualcomm and Apple face off this month in what could wind up being the most significant intellectual property dispute this nation has seen in decades.It boils down to this: The company that pioneered global smartphone connectivity — Qualcomm (QCOM) — and the company that currently holds 15.2% of the world's smartphone market — Apple (APPL) — are embroiled in a multibillion-dollar battle over the technology that makes these devices tick.The long-running dispute is actually multiple cases — approximately 50 separate legal actions filed in 16 jurisdictions across six countries, including a key hearing this month before the International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington, D.C. Qualcomm is asking the ITC for what's known as an exclusion order — or a ban on the importation of certain iPhones that use inferior Intel modems.Its argument? That Apple is using Qualcomm's innovations without a license to do so.""Given their enormous market presence they think they can infringe (upon) our intellectual property with impunity,"" Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg said last week. ""But we have the rule of law in our favor and so we're hoping to get their attention by asking a court to stop them from infringing.""Rosenberg is right. The rule of law is in Qualcomm's favor. And it is essential for our nation's economic future that it be upheld.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMost of the media coverage related to this case has focused on its potential impact on smartphones (and the broader smartphone market) — and that's important. But it is much bigger than that.At the heart of this case is a fundamental question that could define the next century of technological advancement in this country: Do we still believe in innovation in America? Or, conversely, are we becoming a nation where patented technology can be stolen whenever a corporation decides it doesn't want to pay for it anymore?Qualcomm is the company that connected cellphones to the internet. It is responsible for 3G, 4G and is currently pioneering 5G — a ""new era of connectivity"" that will provide consumers, networks, businesses and smartphone manufacturers with super-high speed, ""fiber like"" wireless solutions. According to one economic impact study, 5G will add more than $3 trillion to our nation's gross domestic product and create upward of three million new jobs.Earlier this year, I advocated against, and President Trump ultimately blocked, a threatened takeover of Qualcomm by Broadcomm because the importance of the U.S. being the leader in 5G was widely recognized, and Qualcomm's integral role in developing 5G is indisputable. Without Qualcomm's innovation, the U.S. would cede its dominant position to other nations. It is clear that Qualcomm reinvests its licensing fees into critical research and development and Apple's continued refusal to compensate Qualcomm for its innovation could also hinder the company's (and thereby the country's) ability to advance 5G.Licensing the use of its patented innovations is the heart of Qualcomm's business. It is also what keeps the company and its nearly 40,000 employees in business. Qualcomm's patented modems and other innovations are so indispensable to the operation of smartphones and other mobile devices that the manufacturers of these devices have agreed to not only buy the company's chips — but pay Qualcomm for the right to use the underlying technology.Well, everybody pays except Apple — which is currently delinquent to the tune of up to $4.5 billion when it comes to licensing fees owed to Qualcomm.Apple insists it ""believe(s) deeply in the value of intellectual property,"" but its actions tell a different story. Not only is the company refusing to pay what it owes, it is being accused of infringing Qualcomm's intellectual property (the basis of the ITC complaint). The company is also trying to stonewall the courts in an effort to keep its conduct from coming to light.Last December, a federal judge in San Jose, California issued sanctions against Apple after it refused to turn over evidence related to one of the cases in this dispute.Qualcomm's position remains simple: Licensing agreements are an essential component of incentivizing innovation in this country.Without them, innovation dies.Or to put it another way: Do we want to kill off trillions of dollars in economic activity, and risk no longer being the leader in 5G, because one of the world's richest companies doesn't want to pay what it owes?Samsung Threatens U.S. Prosperity By Disregarding Intellectual-Property RightsHow Dodd-Frank Stole The Recovery By Killing Small-Business GrowthThe Economy Is Not An Engine — So Stop Describing It Like One

The People's Bank of China opted not to follow the Fed in raising borrowing costs, and the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its stimulus when it meets on Friday.Draghi will provide updated economic projections at his news briefing, which may help him address any questions over whether policy makers have acted too hastily given a spate of disappointing data in recent weeks.

The iPhone, iPad, and digital services giant rose 0.5% to 186.31 and is now up 4% from a breakout point of 179.04 in a well-formed double-bottom base.Apple cleared that proper entry on May 4, just days after reporting accelerating growth in both quarterly sales (up 16% to $61.14 billion) and earnings (up 30% to $2.73 a share).Please read this recent Stock Market Today column on three reasons to continue holding Apple shares despite the current downdraft in U.S. equities. Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating improved to 81 on a scale of 1 to 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. This means that over the past 12 months, the largest company by market value in the U.S. exchanges has outperformed 81% of all companies in IBD's database.Four weeks ago, Apple's RS Rating was 76.Other leading stocks rising in heavy volume include the following:RPM International (RPM): The specialty paints and coatings firm cleared a 56.79 entry point in a five-month saucer base following news that it's going to take several initiatives to boost operating and financial performance. Activist fund Elliott Management is a key investor in the Medina, Ohio, company.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): The expert in treating cystic fibrosis rallied nearly 14% to 168.09 in volume running more than triple usual levels. The stock has now taken a serious step in forming the right side of a potential cuplike or saucer-style base.In a saucer, the decline from head to toe can be just as deep as a short cup base. However, they tend to stretch over many months, wearing holders out rather than shaking them out.Read this Investor's Corner on the concepts of the saucer base, one of eight important chart patterns that every growth investor can use to gain an edge on Wall Street.In other financial markets, U.S. Treasuries showed small moves. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond edged up 1 basis point to 2.85%. Three-month T-bills yielded 1.91%, 1 basis point below 1.92% on June 1.West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures rallied 1.2% to $74.32 a barrel, hitting fresh year-to-date highs.

550,KEY,"Age 65 is when Medicare becomes part of many Americans' lives. That's the age when most people — including many in or near retirement — become eligible for the federal health insurance program. Learning how to sign up for Medicare can be a lifeline for anyone coping with disappointing or expensive private health insurance coverage.But you must pay for parts of its coverage, which may not be cheap. So not everyone should sign up right away. Here's advice about how to decide whether you should join the program, when and how.A good start is critical. David Littell, retirement income program co-director at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Penn., says that the biggest mistake that individuals can make under Medicare is not signing up for Parts A and B on a timely basis.""This could result in catastrophic losses for people who end up in a hospital with an accident or illness, then discover that they have inadequate health insurance coverage,"" Littell said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIBD'S TAKE: Read this IBD report for practical, easy, real-world advice about how to save an extra $20 per week for retirement, even if you have a very tight budget.What is a timely basis? The key date is four months before your 65th birthday.Here's how it works. Say a hypothetical Joan Hall turns 65 in August 2018. If she was receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board benefits at least four months earlier, in April 2018, Hall does not have to do anything.Hall's Medicare enrollment will start automatically. Usually, it starts the first day of the month someone is 65.Coverage does not start automatically for people who are not receiving federal retirement benefits at least four months before age 65. They must take action: signing up for Medicare. When you're first eligible, there is a seven-month window.Say Hall was not receiving Social Security in April. Her time window runs from May 2018 through November 2018. That's three months before her 65th birthday in August through three months after.During this time, Hall can apply for Medicare Part A. That mainly covers hospital costs. Most people get coverage for free.Hall also can sign up for Medicare Part B. That covers medical costs such as doctors' visits.Not everyone signs up for Part B at 65, even if they get Part A. If you get your health insurance through an employer with 20 or more employers, check with the benefits manager. Why? If you have coverage by a so-called qualified group plan whose costs and benefits compare well with Medicare, stay in the group and delay signing up for Medicare Part B.The same is true if your health insurance is through your spouse and the coverage's costs and benefits are better than Medicare's.Otherwise, consider switching to Medicare.Medicare advises people who get health insurance through a smaller firm to sign up for Parts A & B when first eligible. The same typically goes for seniors without employer coverage.There is no built-in benefit for delaying Medicare as there is for waiting to start Social Security. The advantage to postponing Part B is to avoid paying the premiums until you begin.In 2018, the standard monthly premium for Part B is $134 per person. Enrollees with high incomes pay as much as $428.60 a month. (This year's premiums are based on 2016 income.)For people who delay Part B, there may be a penalty. Your premium rises by 10% for each full 12-month period that you put off enrolling.So you have a year after the seven-month initial enrollment period ends to get Part B and avoid the penalty. Other exceptions may apply, such as continuing coverage from a group health plan.If you won't start Medicare automatically, you must take steps to enroll. One possibility is to go online to (https://secure.ssa.gov/iClaim/rib). You can go through the process and choose Medicare only.You also can call Social Security at 800-772-1213. Or visit your local Social Security office.During your initial enrollment period, there are other choices. You can sign up for a Medicare Advantage Plan, known as Part C.Those Part C Advantage plans, run by private companies, generally have networks of doctors and hospitals. If you stay in the network, you may pay less to insurance companies for coverage and to health care providers for their services than you would with basic (""original"") Medicare.One reason: you won't pay for a Medigap insurance policy. Medigap is supplementary health insurance that covers some health care costs not covered by original Medicare, such as co-payments and deductibles. Medigap policies sold after Jan. 1, 2006 aren't allowed to provide prescription drug coverage, which is offered by Part D plans. Plan F, the most popular of Medigap's many versions, has a national average annual cost over $1,700.And Advantage plans usually have prescription drug coverage.Without an Advantage plan, you may want Medigap as well as a Part D plan that covers drug costs. With Medicare Advantage or original Medicare, you'll still owe the Part B premium.So check local Advantage plans as well as the available Medigap and Part D policies. Don't worry if you're not happy with your first choice — you can change your selection each year, during the annual Medicare open enrollment period from mid-October to early December.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Four Ways You Can Cut Retirement Costs — With Little SacrificeHow To Apply For Social Security Benefits: What You Need To Know

552,KEY,"Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) stock jumped Tuesday after it and Celgene (CELG) reported a second win in as many weeks for their blood-disease drug called luspatercept.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Acceleron shares rose 2.9%, to 48.76, after earlier popping as much as 5.4%. Celgene advanced 0.9%, to 84.56. Shares of biotech companies broadly dipped less than 1%.Luspatercept could stoke more confidence in Celgene, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said. The firm's biggest cancer drug, Revlimid, will soon face a patent cliff. But Celgene is working other angles in cancer drugs. It acquired Juno Therapeutics and is partnered with Bluebird Bio (BLUE).""We view this as another positive development that, after recent successes with (Juno's drug called) JCAR017 and (Bluebird's drug called) bb2121, could begin to re-instill investor confidence in the pipeline beyond Revlimid not substantially reflected in shares at current levels,"" he said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe study, called Believe, tested luspatercept as a treatment for patients with beta thalassemia who are dependent on regular blood transfusions. These patients don't produce enough of a protein that carries oxygen throughout the body.Luspatercept showed a ""highly statistically significant"" improvement in red blood cell response. The goal was to reduce red blood cell transfusion burden by at least 33%. Researchers also looked for an absolute reduction of at least two transfusion units from week 13 to week 24 of the study.In addition, luspatercept also met all key secondary goals of the study. Side effects were consistent with previously reported data, the biotech companies said in a news release. The firms now plan to ask regulators in the U.S. and Europe to approve the drug in the first half of 2019.The news was largely expected. About two weeks ago, Celgene and Acceleron released positive data for luspatercept in another study. That late-stage test looked at the drug's ability to improve red blood cell response in patients with what are called myelodysplastic syndromes.Analysts had varied models on these two markets for luspatercept. Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster calls for $2 billion in peak sales for both disorders. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges sees $2.6 billion in peak 2025 sales for both uses.RBC's Abrahams models just $1.2 billion for luspatercept — a small fraction of the $12 billion in peak sales for Revlimid. But that could still help Celgene to fill its future Revlimid-shaped hole.""We see this, coupled with other positive pipeline developments for JCAR017 and bb2121 as putting the company (Celgene) on track to reach $10 billion in probability-adjusted sales for its current pipeline,"" he said.Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff was more bearish on partner Acceleron. He downgraded Acceleron stock to a neutral rating and cut his price target to 52 from 55.Tenthoff acknowledged the win for luspatercept but said Acceleron is ""not a buy at this valuation.""He sees sales of $20 million in 2020 after U.S. and European officials likely approve luspatercept. The biggest opportunity for the drug is in myelodysplastic syndromes where it could replace current, less effective therapies.But the tail will be short, Tenthoff said. Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are working on a potentially curative treatment for beta thalassemia. Their therapy could get approval by 2020, he said.""While not all patients will be appropriate for or able to afford gene therapy/CRISPR (a form of gene editing), we anticipate significant competitive pressure to impact Acceleron's market share,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

The outrage is mostly about power — or rather, the utter and unexpected loss of it.In 2009, Obama seemed to usher in a progressive revolution for a generation.Democrats controlled the House. They had a supermajority in the Senate. Obama had a chance to ensure a liberal majority on the Supreme Court for years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDemocrats had gained on Republicans at the state and local levels. The media, universities, professional sports, Hollywood and popular culture were all solidly left-wing.A Republican had not won 51% of the popular vote in a presidential election since George H.W. Bush's 1988 defeat of Democrat Michael Dukakis. Before 2016, Republicans had lost the popular vote in five of the previous six presidential elections.And then visions of a generation of progressive grandeur abruptly vanished.Obama left behind a polarized nation. Democrats lost both the House and the Senate. During Obama's tenure, Democrats lost more than 1,000 seats at the state level.Presumptive winner Hillary Clinton blew the 2016 presidential election.Foolishly, Clinton tried to ensure a landslide victory by wasting precious campaign time in unwinnable red states such as Arizona and Georgia. Meanwhile, she too often neglected winnable purple states such as Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which Obama had won in 2008 and 2012. Clinton apparently forgot that the Electoral College, not the popular vote, elects a president.After his election, President Trump did not implode as predicted. By following the Obama precedent of relying on executive orders, Trump began recalibrating everything from immigration enforcement to energy development.Abroad, Trump did what no other Republican president would have dared, bombing ISIS into submission, canceling the Iran deal, seeking to denuclearize North Korea, pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The U.S. economy took off with new tax cuts and deregulation. Radical improvement in unemployment, economic growth, and oil and natural gas production created new consumer and business confidence.Despite his frequent crudeness, Trump is inching toward a 50% approval rating in a few polls. That has only made an impotent opposition grow even more furious — both at the other half of the country for supporting Trump, and at a buoyant Trump himself for baiting and ridiculing progressives in the fashion of no prior president.Worse still, much of the loss of progressive power was at least partly self-inflicted.Former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid foolishly dropped the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster for executive appointments and most judicial nominations in 2013. That blunder ensured Republicans the chance to remake the Supreme Court when they took over the Senate in 2014.Obama chose not to try to win over his opposition, but to alienate it by veering hard left in his second term. Hillary Clinton foolishly got herself into a number of personal scandals that embarrassed her party and helped lead to her defeat.In reaction to the sudden loss of political power, Democrats would have been wise to run to the center, as did Bill Clinton, who all but ended the era of the Reagan Republicans.They could have dropped their obsession with identity politics and instead attempted to win over blue-collar voters with more inclusive class appeals rather than racial appeals.Instead, Democrats have endlessly replayed the 2016 election. In Groundhog Day fashion, Hillary Clinton repeatedly offered tired excuses for her loss.To progressives, Trump became not an opponent to beaten with a better agenda, but an evil to be destroyed. Moderate Democrats were written off as dense; left-wing fringe elements were praised as clever.Voters in 2016 bristled at redistribution, open borders, bigger government and higher taxes, but progressives are now promising those voters even more of what they didn't want.Furious over the sudden and unexpected loss of power, enraged progressives have so far done almost everything to lose even more of it.And that paradox only leads to more furor.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate MongeringTurns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsAfter Its Hard Left Turn, Will Democratic Party Officially Admit It's Socialist?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

561,KEY,"Evercore Partners (EVR) saw a positive improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Tuesday, with an increase from 79 to 82. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.IBD's proprietary RS Rating identifies market leadership by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of other stocks on the major indexes. Decades of market research reveals that the market's biggest winners typically have an RS Rating of at least 80 in the early stages of their moves.Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineEvercore Partners is working on a consolidation with a 103.15 buy point. See if the stock can clear the breakout price in heavy trading. Be aware that it's a third-stage base. Such patterns can work and do sometimes launch nice runs, but they're more likely to fail than first- or second-stage consolidations. The company saw both earnings and sales growth rise last quarter. Earnings-per-share increased from 0% to 8%. Revenue rose from 5% to 21%. The company is expected to report its latest earnings and sales numbers on or around Apr. 26.The company holds the No. 12 rank among its peers in the Finance-Investment Banking/Brokers industry group.

562,KEY,"Sellers still held the upper hand in stocks today as the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average fell between 0.6% and 0.7%. At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 dropped 0.5% and is poised to make its first weekly loss after rising four weeks in a row. But New York Times defied the sell-off with a new breakout.Hot new China IPO iQiyi (IQ), meanwhile, sold off sharply. The video streaming firm fell more than 10% to 39.51, showing its biggest single-session point loss since breaking out of a narrow IPO base at 20.60.When stocks have made many months of gains and are in a climax run, that would be a sell signal. IQiyi's advance doesn't quite fit that profile, but its slide today is reason to take at least some profits in an offense-minded way.IQiyi also gave short-term traders a potential sell signal after the stock dipped below its 10-day moving average near 38.78 for the first time since its breakout. At one point, iQiyi fell as much as 14.5% to a session low of 37.80. You can see the 10-day moving average as a thin green line on a Leaderboard chart.Among fast-rising growth stocks, the 10-day line often acts as a better indicator of when a leader is ready to take a pause. When a stock has risen more than 10% from a proper buy point, then sharply undercuts the 10-day moving average, it can act as a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The small-cap S&P 600 did slightly worse than the major averages, falling roughly 0.8%. But at 1044, the S&P 600 continues to outmatch the S&P 500 in year-to-date gains, up 11.5% vs. a 3% advance since Jan. 1 for the large-cap benchmark.With less than hour to go in stocks today, volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Wednesday and roughly 5% lower on the NYSE.One small cap in the media space broke out. New York Times (NYT) rallied nearly 5% to hit a high of 26.50. Shares cleared a four-month flat base, a key chart pattern for growth stock investors, at 25.80 in average trade. The permissible buy zone goes up to 27.09.Buying too far extended in price puts an investor at higher risk of being shaken out during a normal pullback by the stock after it breaks out.According to IBD Stock Checkup, NYT's Composite Rating has improved to a respectable 86 on a scale of 1 to 99. Plus, that score is tops within the Media-Newspapers industry group. The next best company is New Media Investment Group (NEWM), owning a mediocre 71 Composite score.NYT logged an 8% increase in the top line to $1.68 billion in 2017. That marked only the second time in at least nine years that the company's sales increased on a year-over-year basis. More recently, NYT has shown a big turnaround in earnings.Profits grew 64%, 117%, 30% and 70% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Easy comparisons helped the cause. Revenue grew 9%, 6%, 10% and 4% over the same time frame. That falls well short of the C factor in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment paradigm. The best stocks tend to show earnings and sales increases of 25% or higher in recent quarters.New Media Investment recently broke out of a 10-week flat base with an 18.05 buy point. At 18.82, the small cap is 4% past that correct entry, or still within the proper buy zone.New Media has grown revenue by 18% and 11% in the prior two quarters, the biggest gains since the first quarter of 2016.Retail internet companies got thumped after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have broad authority to enforce the collection of sales taxes by online retail companies doing business in their jurisdiction. Stamps.com (STMP) slid more than 11% in quadruple normal share turnover and briefly undercut its 50-day moving average.Leaderboard name Etsy (ETSY), the global online marketplace for arts and crafts entrepreneurs, hit a new high of 45.88 but reversed to a 1.6% decline. Volume is running twice its 50-day average.Big declines in heavier than normal volume are a telltale sign of pronounced institutional selling.Etsy, which holds a top-notch 99 Composite Rating, has already rallied more than 45% since vaulting off its 50-day moving average near 29.18 in late May.Shares are also up more than 108% since clearing a cup without handle at 21.96 on Feb. 21, one week after the market staged a Day 4 follow-through and signaled a new market uptrend was possibly in play.The automaker group fared among the 10 worst performers in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups.Ferrari (RACE) gapped lower at the open and skidded 2%. At 140.32, the maker of luxury sports cars is now slightly below a 141.66 buy point in a five-week flat base.Tesla (TSLA) fell nearly 3% but is still finding a floor of potential support at the 350 level. Shares of the electric-vehicle pioneer continue to sail well past its rising 50-day moving average, which has recently risen back above 300.The stock continues to work on a large first-stage base.While the Street sees the company losing $6.82 a share this year, it also expects Tesla to turn a profit of $2.52 a share in 2019.In other financial markets, investors bought back long-dated U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 2.90%.Ahead of the OPEC meeting on Friday in Vienna, Austria, WTI crude oil futures edged 0.1% lower to $65.62 a barrel.

563,KEY,"A new threat by President Trump to apply 10% tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imported goods put the U.S. stock market on a slicker path to a potential market correction on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average and the NYSE composite battled to stay above their key 50-day moving averages.Volume rose on both main exchanges vs. Monday, according to early data readings. That implied unusually heavy institutional selling.The Dow industrial average and the NYSE composite slid 1.1% and 0.6% in stocks today, respectively, but both rebounded off their session lows. The Dow industrial average, finishing at 24,700, is now down about 0.1% since Jan. 1.Those losses, however, were not as frightening as the sell-offs among China mainland indexes. Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark dropped 2.8% overnight  and cut its long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since December 2016. The Shanghai composite skidded 3.8% lower, hitting lows not seen since June 2016.Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) and other high-octane growth stocks that are leading the digital transformation of the global economy continued to flex strength.Netflix, the eighth largest company on the Nasdaq exchange by market cap, jumped 3.7% to a new high of 404.98 in brisk volume, 84% above its 50-day average. The big move helped the Nasdaq composite cut its early 1.4% drubbing to less than a 0.3% decline by day's end.Netflix joined IBD Leaderboard on Dec. 6, 2016, as the stock was forming a base next to a much larger set of bases. Then the stock broke out past a correct entry point at 129.39 in early January 2017. The stock has since advanced 208% and is currently extended from a proper buy point.At 7725, the Nasdaq holds a 12% year-to-date gain. The Nasdaq 100 also hustled off its intraday low, slipping just 0.3%. Both the Nasdaq composite and the Nasdaq 100 are trading less than 1% below their all-time highs.The S&P 500 chopped its early decline to 0.4% as strength in defensive stocks, including utilities, offset weakness in automaker, steel, construction and farming machinery, chemical and coal stocks. Biotech, movie, drug store chain and auto parts firms also rallied.The small-cap S&P 600 outperformed, losing just 0.1%. At 1044, the index is up 11.5% since Jan. 1.Also within IBD Leaderboard, at least three top-shelf retailers seem to be feeling less of an impact on the escalating tit for tat between the world's two largest economies.Discount and variety store chain Five Below (FIVE), premium yogawear retailer Lululemon (LULU) and online marketplace Etsy (ETSY) are all holding up well since their excellent breakouts in recent months.All three Leaderboard names show strong double-digit earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Etsy soared 28% last week on news that it's adding new services for sellers while also raising transaction fees.Etsy grew its top line by 19%, 21%, 24% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street expects Q2 revenue to jump 25% to $127.1 million and earnings to rise 150% to a nickel a share. The Brooklyn-based company has 119 million shares outstanding and a float of 116 million.The stock has rallied 103% since bolting out of an eight-week cup without handle at 21.96 on Feb. 21.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen searching for excellent stocks, be sure to check that a company meets the C in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investing paradigm. C stands for current earnings growth of 25% or more in the latest quarter. An acceleration in the rate of year-over-year growth? Even better. Institutional investors highly prize companies that are able to post bigger profit gains vs. recent quarters.Lululemon, a member of the IBD 50, still sees the majority of its revenue coming from North America. The Vancouver-based firm has posted EPS increases of 3%, 19%, 33% and 72% in the past four quarters. In other words, it's shown growth acceleration in the bottom line for three periods in a row.The Street sees earnings rising 26% to 49 cents a share in the July-ending fiscal second quarter.Financial payment, credit history and transactions-related firms are also holding up well. TransUnion (TRU), Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) are keeping their solid long-term uptrends intact. The former, also in IBD Leaderboard, reversed from mild losses to gain 0.6%.Square (SQ), the innovator in point of sale technology and financial services for small and medium businesses, doesn't seem to be perturbed by Trump's aggressive tariff policy. The San Francisco-based company dropped 4% in the early going before shaving the loss to less than 0.4%.At 65.94, the stock is holding on to a 15% gain past a 57.29 entry in a nine-week cup with handle.That base also shows elements of a double bottom, one of the eight key chart patterns that growth investors can use to time their market buys during a confirmed uptrend in the stock market.Wall Street forecasts Square increasing its earnings by 70% to 46 cents a share in 2018, then doing it again to 78 cents in 2019.No doubt, commodities are being targeted by Chinese government officials with less than six months to go before critical midyear U.S. elections take place in November.Nucor (NUE), the largest U.S. steelmaker by market value, dropped as much as 4% and flirted with its rising 50-day moving average before rebounding some to end at 65.47.The Charlotte, N.C., firm has been locked in a trading range of 59 to 70 since January. Yet the stock is also building a new base and stands just 7% below the 70.48 peak.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings vaulting 86% to $6.67 a share this year, then easing 7% to $6.18 in 2019. Sales growth has been powerful lately, rising 14%, 30%, 22%, 21%, 29% and 16% in the past six quarters.Tesla (TSLA) led the automakers down more than 4% as a group on a price-weighted basis. Autos finished worst among all 197 industry groups tracked by IBD each day.But Tesla, the electric vehicle pioneer, actually needed to catch its breath following strong gains the past three weeks.Shares closed down nearly 5% to 352.55 in heavy turnover. Watch to see if the 350 round number level offers a floor of support. Tesla also now has a nice air cushion above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.For now, Tesla continues to work on a huge base that stretches all the way back to September 2017. In the week ended Sept. 15 that year, the stock broke out of an 11-week cup with handle at 370.10, but reversed sharply lower the next week. The negative action triggered the golden rule of investing — keep your losses small in every investment, preferably at 8% or less.In other financial markets, crude oil rallied amid some hopes that OPEC and Russia will agree to either no change in their production quotas or raise output only by a little. Investors will be watching the results of a Friday meeting closely.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 2.89%. Yields fall when bond prices rise.

565,KEY,"Oil prices careened lower Friday as several key pieces of news preceded what promises to be a critical OPEC meeting on June 22.Weekly rig count data showed a mild decrease in overall U.S. drilling activity. But gas drilling accounted for the pullback. Oil-focused drilling actually added one rig for the week. But oil and energy stocks began their sell-off long before the data were released. The cause appeared to be a raft of early news potentially affecting the oil supply outlook.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate dropped 2.9% to below $65 a barrel, snapping a four-day rebound from its early-June lows. Europe's Brent crude benchmark dived 3.5%. Even so, WTI oil prices had climbed 0.2% for the week through Thursday. The advance came despite concerns that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries planned to increase its production quota.The Times of India reported on Friday that India and China had launched discussions in Beijing exploring the idea of a buyers' cartel. The partnership reportedly aimed at countering OPEC's market manipulation. The two countries accounted for nearly 17% of global oil consumption last year, the report said.

The always-volatile Canadian Explorers and Producers group fell hardest, with the International E&P and U.S. E&P groups not far behind.Among international E&P names, Calgary's Encana (ECA) and ConocoPhillips (COP) were among the hardest hit Friday, down 4.3% and 4.1%, respectively.

567,KEY,"Like psychologists, advisors can find themselves in intimate conversations with clients. To do their job, they need to listen raptly and gather highly personal information.Some clients speak freely about the most sensitive issues. Others prefer to avoid certain topics altogether.By building trust and not passing judgment, advisors learn more from even the most reluctant clients. The key is making individuals feel comfortable opening up and revealing their innermost secrets.""Advisors need to create a safe atmosphere,"" said Lynn Dunston, a certified financial planner in Denver, Colo. ""We're letting them know we want to interact on a human level.""When leading these get-to-know-you meetings, Dunston begins by making three points. He assures them of confidentiality, emphasizes he won't judge what they say and thanks them in advance for sharing.""They usually respond with a sigh of relief and say, 'That's good to know,' "" he said.His third point — thanking them for confiding in him — wields a special power. Many clients appreciate a sincere expression of gratitude and feel less guarded as a result.""I want them to know that I'm honored to hear their stories,"" Dunston said. ""And when they share their stories, I thank them again. It shows I don't take that for granted. And that brings us closer.""Dunston has learned that by remaining quiet, clients are more apt to talk. Even if they veer off-topic, he stays silent and does not interrupt.Because financial planners spend much of their day dishing out advice, it's natural to want to offer guidance to clients grappling with difficulty. But if they feel hesitant opening up, it's often best to restrain the urge to advise.Clients may need time to weigh whether to broach a painful subject, such as their troubled marriage or a family tragedy. Advisors who strike an attentive pose signal that they are ready to listen.""I learned early in my career to match and mirror clients' body posture,"" Dunston said. ""If they lean forward, I lean forward. It signals, 'I hear you. I'm with you. I want to hear more.' ""The setting also plays a role. If clients feel relaxed in your environment, they're less likely to withhold sensitive information.Shelly Terzolo, an advisor in Syracuse, N.Y., meets with clients around a table rather than from behind a desk. She offers them a beverage and lets them steer the conversation.""I don't start off by opening a folder with a long questionnaire,"" she said. ""I just have a notepad and a pen, and I'll move it aside to set the stage for them to feel comfortable in the space.""She has found that some clients are less inclined to open up if they see her writing notes as they speak. By maintaining friendly eye contact, she strengthens her bond with them.Part of the challenge for advisors is prompting clients to flesh out their thoughts and feelings on a delicate matter. In many cases, individuals will not tackle a tender subject head-on; instead, they will hem and haw until they feel ready to address the core issue.With a compassionate nod of the head, Terzolo shows her sympathy while allowing clients to elaborate. Her goal is to assure them that she cares and wants to help.""I don't want them to feel bad that they brought it up,"" she said.Flexibility pays off as well. Advisors may plan for a meeting to focus on investment strategy, but a preoccupied client may raise an entirely different and more personal concern.""You can't say to someone who talks about some trauma or horrible situation with their family, 'Oh, that's too bad. Let's get back to that $4 million in your 401(k),' "" said Nancy Coutu, a certified financial planner in Oak Brook, Ill. ""I might be the first person they've told this to.""At the same time, Coutu knows not to press clients to divulge more. Observing their nonverbal cues helps her build rapport and avoid awkward moments.""I read body language,"" she said. ""If they're wrestling in their seat and not making eye contact, I'll move on and not keep asking about that. I may come back to it later.""Coutu lays the groundwork for more searching conversations by having new clients complete a questionnaire and bring it to their first appointment. Glancing at their responses might trigger an icebreaker such as, ""I see you have five kids.""""Rather than dive into money, I start by acknowledging the information they've already shared,"" Coutu said. ""What's important is do they have a problem that I can solve?""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:When Clients Acquire Vast Wealth, Advisors Are A Priceless ResourceIf You're Going To A Conference, Get The Most Out Of Every MinuteBuilding A Successful Financial Advisory Practice?

568,KEY,"Stock futures pointed to solid early gains Friday, after banks received a positive report card from the Federal Reserve and Nike (NKE) swooshed higher after its fiscal fourth-quarter report.Other hot performers in Friday's premarket session included JPMorgan (JPM), KB Home (KBH) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Despite Thursday's rebound, the major indexes were down for the week. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were tacking toward their second straight weekly slip, and the Dow was set to extend its losing streak to three weeks. Markets may hang back a bit before personal income and spending numbers for May come out before the starting bell on Friday. And China's markets will remain in sharp focus, as the yuan descends to near a critical level vs. the dollar.Constellation Brands (STZ) and Greenbrier (GBX) are among the notable names set to report Friday morning.S&P 500 futures traded 0.6% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures jumped 0.8%.  Dow futures strengthened to 0.8% above fair value.Nike surged nearly 10%. A late banking rally spurred by release of the Federal Reserve's most recent round of stress tests lifted JPMorgan (JPM) nearly 2% and Goldman Sachs (GS) more than 1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Instead, the Fed held the banks' payouts to levels from prior years, saying that the companies, in effect, needed to save more money.Wells Fargo shares received the largest boost among big banks from the Fed's stress-test report. The San Francisco-based bank, which spent years in the hot seat regarding its practices during the financial crisis, received approval from the Fed for its balance sheet and capital spending plans. As a result, the company late Thursday raised its quarterly dividend to 43 cents from 39 cents, and announced plans to throw an additional $15 billion into its share-buyback program. Shares rose nearly 3% in after-hours trade.Citibank (C) rose 2.2% as it boosted its dividend 41% to 45 cents and launched a $17.6 billion share buyback.JPMorgan climbed 1.6% in Friday's premarket trade. It hiked its quarterly payout 43% to 54 cents and said it would buy back up to $20.7 billion in stock.Nike was the Dow's heavy hitter after hours. It scrambled up nearly 10% after reporting its North American sales had turned around after a three-quarter slide. Revenue and earnings growth topped analyst consensus targets, and the company announced a $15 billion share buyback.Nike shares ended Thursday in a test of the 10-week moving average and it's creating a buy range at that level. The new buy zone coincides with the buy area from a 70.35 buy point. Nike's retail wingman, Foot Locker (FL), also gained, rising 1.4% in late trade. Shares ended Thursday in a buy range above a cup-base buy point at 53.27.KB Home narrowed its gain to 1.7% early Friday, following fiscal second-quarter results that handily topped analysts' consensus views. Deliveries, new orders and backlogs rose in low single digits. The stock is trying to pull up from a six-month decline.Vertex Pharmaceuticals had vaulted more than 8% to lead the Nasdaq 100 in Thursday's after-hours trade, but was inactive early Friday. There was no immediately apparent news on Vertex late Thursday. Earlier, the company announced that Canadian regulators approved its cystic fibrosis treatment, Symdeko, after positive Phase 3 trial results. The stock cut below key levels of support this week, complicating a three-month base formation.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Nasdaq Finds Support At 50-Day Line; Stocks Play Successful DefenseNasdaq Leads Bounce With 0.8% Gain; How Amazon.com Roiled Pharmacy StocksBeer Giant Near A Buy With Earnings Due; Fed's Favorite Inflation Gauge On Tap: Action PlanBanks Set Big Buybacks, Dividend Hikes; Fed Curbs Morgan, Goldman Payouts

571,KEY,"If you are new to buying or selling growth stocks when they break out, you might wonder what to do when this happens: A leader crosses above a proper buy point, then falls below it by day's end. This is exactly what the biotech stock Biogen, a former true market leader, did back in early 2013.Should you sell and hit the ejector button?Not always. Even if the stock is below your purchase price and beneath the proper entry, such action is not an absolute reason to exit the position. IBD research has found that as many as four out of 10 great winners will test the buy point after a breakout. Some stocks do so a few weeks after the start of a big move up. Others simply do so the same day as the breakout itself.The time to sell quickly? When you have to cut losses at 7% to 8%. You could also get out if the price-and-volume action is repeatedly poor, as noted in an Investor's Corner published on June 29.A close below the breakout point could highlight worsening market conditions. Do you check IBD's current outlook regularly? See it in Market Pulse, found in each day's The Big Picture column. If the market is selling off and the outlook is weak, consider raising some cash. Is it still a confirmed uptrend? If yes, then hold the stock.It's always vital to check that you've picked a true industry leader in a top-performing sector. Let's review Biogen (BIIB) as it vaulted past a 155.40 trigger point in a well-formed base on Jan. 28, 2013.At one point, shares rallied 7.3% to as high as 156.94. Yet by day's end, Biogen had risen 2.6% to 149.99, nearly 6 points below the breakout point. Volume bulged 130% above the 50-day average, a good sign.On Dec. 31, 2012, IBD upgraded the market outlook to ""uptrend resumes"" just as the Nasdaq gained 2% in heavy volume. By the time Biogen broke out, the Nasdaq marked only two distribution days, or significant declines by key indexes in higher volume. Therefore, the market was acting right.Biogen rallied more than 80%, peaked at 157.18 on Sept. 26, 2012 (1), then formed the 18-week cup with handle. A 14.8% drop within the base hinted that large funds weren't selling en masse. Biogen bottomed at its 200-day moving average, then rebounded within 2 points of the cup's left-side high. (See a historical chart on MarketSmith to view the 200-day line.) The handle was long, yet Biogen didn't undercut the 200-day line again.A 10% drop from the handle's high (2) to low met the maximum allowed decline of 12%. The handle slanted lower along the lows. Perfect. Why care about a good handle? Think of it as one final brief and light shakeout of uncommitted holders right before the stock muscles out of the base.After the wild breakout day, big sellers hid in the shadows. Biogen rose in six of the next seven sessions. On Feb. 6 (3), the stock traded 7.6% past the proper entry, leaving the 5% buy zone. At the time, the firm was building its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera into a revenue powerhouse. Biogen's sales jumped 26% in 2013 to a record $6.93 billion. Earnings grew 37% to $8.96 a share.Two years later in May 2015, Biogen peaked at 480.18, up 209%.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:How To Use Stock Charts And Find The Correct Buy Point For Virtually Any StockThe Latest Changes To IBD's Growth Stock Lists: Go HereGlobal Stock LeadersThe Best Large Caps Today: Inside IBD Big Cap 20This Should Happen In Every Stock Breakout

572,KEY,"When Kris Bakowski was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2002, the Georgia resident felt relieved to finally put a name to the fog that was slowly enveloping her brain, even if there was no viable Alzheimer's treatment.For months, she would forget her own phone number. She had trouble with colleagues' names. Mapping out her route home from work became a chore. One day she found herself alone at the mall without any recollection where she was or how she got there.Biopharma companies believe they might be able to help soon. Analysts say Biogen (BIIB) could be first to crack the code on a disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment that slows the disease's progression. Indeed, Biogen and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase 2 tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease after 18 months. The news sent Biogen stock soaring by more than 23% at one point Friday.Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN) and others also are developing potential Alzheimer's drugs, along with a number of development-stage biotech companies.Victory is not certain, though. A number of Big Pharma companies, including Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), have been down this road and abandoned planned Alzheimer's treatments. But at least one expert sees success in the next decade, which wouldn't come too soon for Bakowski and other Alzheimer's patients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBakowski, now 62, has been blogging about her Alzheimer's experience for 15 years. In a blog post for the Alzheimer's Association, she describes the eight months of testing that led to her diagnosis and subsequent relief. She's hopeful for a cure in her son's lifetime, but her family isn't so optimistic.""My husband likened it to the Titanic — that the ship was sinking, and he and my son were going to survive and I wasn't,"" she wrote. ""My son reflected that it was like his mother was on death row, but innocent of the crime.""The potential Alzheimer's market is massive. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. Without a way to intervene, the Alzheimer's Association expects the cost of caring for people with these diseases to hit $1.1 trillion by 2050, in today's dollars. That would be up from an estimated $277 billion in 2018.But, like Bakowski, many experts are hopeful.Privately held Proclara Biosciences is among a cadre of biotech companies aiming to develop an Alzheimer's treatment. Chief Medical Officer David Michelson calls the field ""pretty vibrant.""Michelson, who has held positions at Merck and Lilly, says the steady drumbeat of ""bad news"" in Alzheimer's treatments reflects not so much a failure to affect their specific targets in the brain but issues such as side effects in specific tests. He recently spoke during a webinar hosted by Endpoints News.""There's a lot of really tremendous work that's ongoing and it's enabling new approaches that are becoming possible and generating promising new targets,"" he said. ""I am actually very hopeful and optimistic about what the next five to 10 years hold for research in Alzheimer's.""Several drugs have been approved in the U.S. to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type, including Aricept from Eisai and Namenda from Allergan (AGN). Both treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Neither can cure the disease.Elliot Goldstein, chief executive of ProMIS Neurosciences, can count these types of treatment on one hand. None of them slow the progression of the disease, he told Investor's Business Daily. ProMIS is also working on an Alzheimer's treatment. It trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange for under 1 and doesn't have any sales or earnings yet. Goldstein previously worked at Novartis, which is also developing Alzheimer's drugs.Biogen's strongest hope is a drug now dubbed aducanumab. Goldstein predicts the drug will come to market in 2020.""Aducanumab has a high potential of approval because it has showed a small improvement on decline"" of patients into Alzheimer's symptoms, he said.Biogen did not respond to a request for comment for this article.Visit the IBD Stock Checkup to see how Biogen rates now on key fundamental and technical metrics.In total, Biogen has six potential Alzheimer's treatments in its pipeline. Aducanumab is farthest along, with a late-stage study likely to have data in 2019 or 2020, analysts say.Biogen and Eisai's Thursday announcement involved another drug known as BAN2401. Tests involved 856 patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. The companies said the drug, an antibody, achieved ""statistical significance on key predefined endpoints"" that evaluated effectiveness at 18 months. Biogen stock jumped 19.6% to close at 357.48 but had surged to an intraday high of 367.89 for a gain of 23.1% at one point.Still, it's a messy field. Biogen stock plunged 6.6% on Valentine's Day this year after it added 510 new patients to an ongoing study of aducanumab. That move caught investors off-guard. Also that week, Merck scrapped a late-stage Alzheimer's treatment study as the risks looked likely to outweigh benefits.""It can be a volatile area,"" Canaccord analyst Sumant Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily. ""There have been very spectacular failures in the past. There's a component of the investor who thinks, 'What if the next one works?' That can help from a stock point of view.""Then again, he said, ""Nothing else has worked in the past.""The trouble in Alzheimer's treatment research is that scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the disease. One prevailing theory ties the disease to the buildup of toxic plaque in the brain. That happens when a protein called beta-amyloid structurally changes. Beta-amyloid is sticky and clumps together, becoming plaque.Pharmaceutical companies are looking at two approaches to beta-amyloid that essentially boil down to either removing it or preventing it. BACE inhibitors work to prevent the buildup, while monoclonal antibodies — like Biogen's aducanumab — aim to remove it.ProMIS' Goldstein notes adverse events also must be sidestepped. Some Alzheimer's treatments come with a side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. This refers to swelling in the brain. Goldstein says ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment, set to begin clinical studies in 2019, doesn't cause that.But Mizuho analyst Salim Syed says it's possible to help patients get past ARIA. A common idiom of the industry is, ""If you don't get ARIA, are you really treating the plaque?"" he told IBD.Then, there's the trouble of determining whether a study is designed well, Proclara's Michelson says. First, evidence must show the drug engaged the intended target, like beta-amyloid. Second, patients must be proven to actually have Alzheimer's. Third, the study must be big and of appropriate duration.""It turns out when you look back across history, there aren't that many studies and that many drugs that have been studied in a way that really fulfills all three of these elements,"" he said.He argues that only two studies have hit all three design goals. They are Merck's now-failed BACE inhibitor known as verubecestat and Biogen's aducanumab.In February, Merck scrapped a study of its Alzheimer's treatment in patients with prodromal, or very early-stage, Alzheimer's disease. A year earlier, it said the same drug had ""virtually no chance of finding a positive effect"" in patients with mild or moderate forms of the disease.Meanwhile, the field is thinning. J&J stopped a midstage test of a BACE inhibitor in a group of patients in May because of liver safety concerns. In January, Pfizer (PFE) stopped all research in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment failure in late 2016 was acutely painful for the company. Its monoclonal antibody called solanezumab lost out in three late-stage studies. The last study was in patients with a mild form of Alzheimer's.ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment binds to several toxic misfolded proteins causing Alzheimer's, Goldstein says. It functions on the theory that there are other targets in Alzheimer's disease outside of beta-amyloid. Some drugs are also testing the theory that tangles of a protein called tau could be the root cause.Privately held United Neurosciences hopes to come in with a vaccine for Alzheimer's. The goal is to use the drug as both a treatment for early Alzheimer's and as a preventive measure. Physicians must administer the drug before ""it's too late to rescue the brain,"" United Neurosciences Chief Medical Officer Ajay Verma told Investor's Business Daily.Verma's background is at Biogen, where he directed the development of drugs, including aducanumab. Before that, he was at Merck and Novartis.Verma expects aducanumab to get approval. Several sell-side analysts model around a 35% likelihood that aducanumab can appease the Food and Drug Administration.But Verma sees a possibility that aducanumab could be expensive, since it would be the first treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. ""I think the challenge is, will it be a solution or just for the rich?"" he said.Verma ultimately expects the solution to treating Alzheimer's disease to lie in combinations of drugs. That's been key in treating cancer, HIV, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and high cholesterol, he says.Without intervention, the number of Alzheimer's patients will triple by 2050, James Hendrix said in Endpoints News' webinar. Hendrix is the director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association.""We need better therapies and we need them sooner rather than later,"" Hendrix said.But Alzheimer's treatment studies are tricky, United Neurosciences' Verma says. A barrier between the blood and the brain makes getting a drug to the brain difficult. Plus, animal models aren't particularly predictive, and studies must run for long periods of time.Further complicating matters, science isn't sure which stage is the best to treat.Those reasons are at the center of a 0.5% approval rate from the FDA for Alzheimer's treatments, according to a 2015 paper presented by Hendrix. The industry average is 4.1%.Research is improving, though, Hendrix says. Scientists are aware of the potential impact of beta-amyloid and tau, as well as a number of approaches targeting different stages. In the end, it could be enough for an Alzheimer's treatment to just delay the beginning of the disease by several years, he says.""It might be possible to delay the onset for us to die of something else,"" he said.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What You Should ExpectHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

574,KEY,"President Donald Trump's imminent decision on whether to hit China with tariffs starting Friday could easily make this the best or worst week of the year for the stock market. The implications of the Trump China tariff decision are that big: Either we're at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing, or — more likely — Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.The big Wall Street fear is that the Trump China tariff decision won't just trigger retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, but will provoke Beijing to find additional ways to hinder U.S. multinationals like Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL) in Chinese markets. Beijing has already held the merger of Qualcomm (QCOM) with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) hostage.The Dow Jones industrial average — which includes Apple, Boeing and Caterpillar — opened solidly lower on the stock market today, but rallied to close slightly higher. The Dow Jones remained just below its 200-day moving average after undercutting that key support last week. The S&P 500 index rose Monday after undercutting its 50-day line once again intraday. The Nasdaq composite led with a 0.8% gain.But if the Trump China tariff threat is put to rest — or at least put on hold — the relief could be palpable. In a Sunday note, Morgan Stanley warned that President Trump is likely to follow through on his tariff threats.""We no longer doubt that the U.S. administration's proposals signal the direction of trade policy.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""An escalatory cycle of protectionist actions, not just rhetoric, has begun and will continue,"" wrote Michael Zezas, chief strategist for U.S. public policy at Morgan Stanley.Growing alarm over Trump trade policy should give way to a major relief rally if the president calls a cease-fire with China this week.Trump is set to hit Beijing with 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of mostly tech-related imports on Friday, July 6. The same day, China is ready to hit back — dollar for dollar — with tariffs aimed primarily at autos and agriculture. Chinese imports from Ford and Tesla would be hit with an extra 25% tariff, more than reversing Beijing's cut in auto import tariffs from 25% to 15%, effective July 1. Daimler has already warned that it expects Chinese tariffs on its Alabama-built Mercedes-Benz SUV to hit sales and profits.Here's why the deadline is so important: Trump has already bent over backward to appease Beijing. If the two sides can't make enough progress toward a trade cease-fire this week to avert the imposition of tariffs, then a deal will become even less likely as threats turn to outright hostilities, which may quickly escalate. The U.S. has tariffs on another $16 billion worth of goods from China, including semiconductors, nearly ready to go, and China is ready to retaliate. Beyond that, Trump has directed trade officials to draw up tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.But there's good reason to expect a deal, or at least a delay in the Trump China tariff deadline. If Trump really intended to launch a China trade war, he probably wouldn't have gone to bat to save 70,000 Chinese tech jobs.First, he pledged to reverse sanctions that had forced Chinese communications gear firm ZTE out of business, pushing back against a Senate move to reject a lesser punishment. Then, last week, Trump dropped a plan for emergency China investment and export rules, including a 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology. Trump instead took a less combative tack, backing legislation in Congress to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.Reading between the lines — and threats — Trump has already made pretty clear that he wants a trade deal, not a China trade war, and he came close to reaching one in May that would have had Beijing buy an additional $70 billion in U.S. goods. Even though it would have done relatively little to narrow the trade deficit with China, Trump touted the emerging deal, tweeting that China would ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.China appears open to such a deal, if it can avert tariffs and trade restrictions that jeopardize its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy. Signs of an economic slowdown in China and financial fragility only raise the importance of a trade cease-fire.If Trump reaches an accord with China, Wall Street may begin to relax about Trump's threat to hit U.S. auto imports with tax of 20% to 25%. The European Union has reportedly threatened to retaliate with tariffs on $300 billion worth of imports from the U.S., the equivalent of a full-scale trade war. But General Motors (GM), Toyota (TM) and other automakers have warned that Trump's plan could sink U.S. auto sales by 2 million vehicles a year and deliver a hit to manufacturing employment. Like Trump's threat to launch a full-scale trade war against Beijing, a big tax on auto imports looks so potentially disruptive to world trade that it may begin to be seen as lacking credibility.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trade War Fireworks Burn These 2 SectorsRetail, Energy Among Top Stock Plays As Sector Rotation OccursStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchChart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart Patterns

575,KEY,"Today, it would be true to report many of the well-known large-cap biotech stocks are showing ""disappointing"" or ""downright awful"" performance in 2018. Just witness the damage lately in shares of Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).XIt would also be true to report that some companies in IBD's biotech industry group have been fantastic winners.Select gene therapy firms have been rising fast since breakouts in the second half of 2017. And blood disease expert Bioverativ, a Biogen spinoff, had a nice rally going before it soared 62% on Jan. 22. Make sure you see the big price gap in the accompanying chart below. Bioverativ soared in mammoth volume on news that it's being acquired by French pharmaceuticals titan Sanofi (SNY) for $11.6 billion.Could an investor have used good stock charts to find a breakout by Bioverativ before it made that giant single-day gain? Yes. Bioverativ crafted a double-bottom base, helping to set up the big move.If you don't use stock charts, you're trading at a disadvantage. Without charts, it's very tough to determine two keys about the market: 1) the current psychology of buyers and sellers; and 2) the balance of supply vs. demand in any given stock.When did Bioverativ break out? Jan. 9, while the stock market itself was in a confirmed uptrend. A confirmed uptrend is the best time to buy top-performing growth stocks. You have greater odds of making money when you invest with the larger trend.The specialist in therapies for hemophilia and rare blood disorders established an excellent prior uptrend, running from 44.98 on the close of its Feb. 2, 2017, market debut to a peak of 64.41 more than five months later. The stock corrected 16% in four weeks and carved out a three-month saucer with handle (1), but never broke out.Then Bioverativ really began to sell off.On Oct. 27, the midcap swooned 12% and hit as low as 50.50 (2). This created the first low in the base. In a proper double bottom, a stock will rebound back near its highs, then sell off a second time. And during that decline, the stock must undercut the first low.Why? You want to see an authentic shakeout of uncommitted shareholders. Find signs that shares move from weak hands to strong hands.The correct buy point? When the stock rises a dime over the middle peak in between the two lows.Bioverativ did exactly that. The stock rebounded up to 58.19, less than 3 points off the base's left-side peak of 60.74, then nose-dived again. This time, the sell-off took Bioverativ all the way to 48.28. A fine undercut of the first low (3).A double bottom forms over a minimum seven weeks. Corrections of more than, say, 30% to 33% are not ideal. The deeper the correction, the more a stock has to work just to get back to its highs.Look for signs of symmetry within the base. It should look like a ""W"" except that the second low undercuts the first.Bioverativ possessed all of these bullish traits in its 11-week double bottom. On Jan. 9, 2018, the stock gapped up 7%, surpassing the 58.29 buy point (middle peak of 58.19 plus 10 cents).  Volume gushed 75% above normal levels. Seven sessions later, Bioverativ traded at 64.11, up 10% from the proper entry, right before the acquisition news sent shares vaulting 62%.Prior to its breakout, the Waltham, Mass., firm notched quarterly earnings-per-share gains of 64%, 73% and 31%.

576,KEY,"Stocks staged a solid open Wednesday, as the Trump Administration eased some China-trade threats, and strong gains across Europe halted a sell-off begun earlier in China. The morning's backdrop showed China's bear market worsening, and oil prices rising as markets assessed whether U.S. sanctions threatened against buyers of Iranian oil had opened a new chapter in the global trade war.China trade-sensitive names Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) vied with oil names Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) to lead the Dow. ""Smackdown"" owner World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) scored one of the market's strongest early wins. Conagra (CAG) fell hardest among S&P 500 stocks, after announcing its acquisition of Pinnacle Foods (PF).The Nasdaq Composite popped 0.4% at the start of trade. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each gained 0.3%.Markets in the U.S. and Europe strengthened after the Trump Administration backed away from threats to use executive authority to impose sweeping restrictions on China-based companies investing in U.S. technologies and businesses. Instead, news reports quoted senior administration officials saying the administration would rely on Congress to update existing laws, rather than assessing arbitrary restrictions based on national security threats.The official said the White House would work with Congress to update the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. rules, in a way that ""maintains the open investment climate"" in the U.S. That was a sharp change in tone from Monday's announcement that the administration would seek to halt further technology exports to China and block targeted Chinese investments in U.S. technology firms.On the Dow, Caterpillar and Boeing rose in tandem, up 1.7% apiece.  Caterpillar has fallen in nine of the past 10 sessions, Boeing has dropped in eight of the past 11 days. Both stocks have broken below key levels of technical support, causing significant damage to their base-building efforts.Exxon and Chevron (CVX) were also among the Dow's early leaders, up 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively, as oil prices jumped to six-week highs. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday threatened sanctions against countries and companies who failed to end purchases of Iranian oil by November. Oil also was squeezed higher by industry data showing a 9.2 million barrel draw on inventories in the week ended June 22. Economists had projected a 2.6 million barrel decrease. Official weekly supply numbers are due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude vaulted 1.5% higher, to near $72 a barrel, in early trade.Conagra opened 6.8% lower — and Pinnacle Foods fell 4.1% — after Conagra said it would acquire the Parsippany, N.J.-based competitor in a cash/stock deal valued at $10.9 billion. Conagra owns the Chef Boyardee, Marie Callendar's and Healthy Choice Brands. Pinnacle's brands include Bird's Eye, Duncan Hines and Mrs. Paul's.The loss sent Pinnacle back below a 66.76 buy point in a 12-month saucer base. Conagra's tumble sent shares below their 10- and 40-week moving averages, snuffing a long-term basing effort.Also in the packaged food space, General Mills (GIS) notched an early 0.7% advance. The Minneapolis-based owner of Cheerios, Wheaties and Betty Crocker reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Revenue met analyst targets, and company management issued upside full-year earnings guidance.World Wrestling Entertainment jack-hammered an 6.7% gain in opening trade. The Stamford, Conn.-based company announced a five-year deal placing its ""Monday Night Raw"" program on Comcast's (CMCSA) USA channel, and its ""Smackdown"" series on Fox Networks on Friday nights. The company said the deal would more than triple the annual value of its U.S. distribution rights. WWE shares are up 132% since the start of the year,In other earnings news, AeroVironment shook of its premarket loss and traded with narrow gains. Fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, reported late Tuesday, declined much less than expected and a 1% revenue gain that eked past the consensus target. The maker of remote-controlled drones remained in a buy range, after breaking out on Tuesday past a 61.25 cup-with-handle buy point in heavy volume.Drive-in burger joint Sonic (SONC) tanked 9.6%. The Oklahoma City, Okla.-based chain reported, after Tuesday's close, fiscal third-quarter revenue and earnings narrowly above analyst consensus targets. Same-store-sales and drive-in margins declined, and management trimmed is full-year earnings guidance. The dive narrowed Sonic's gain from a June 7 breakout to 8%.China's markets rebooted Monday's sell-off as the yuan slid below the 6.6-per-dollar level, a key technical level. The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.1%, digging deeper into bear market territory. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index swooned 1.8%, putting it more than 15% below its February high.Japan managed to buffer the selling somewhat. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 held to a 0.3% decline, despite the yen's safe-haven advance vs. the dollar.Stocks in Europe shook off early losses and rallied in afternoon trade. London's FTSE 100 jumped 1.1%, Frankfurt's DAX leapt 1.3% and the CAC-40 in Paris surged 1.4% higher.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Stocks Bounce Modestly But Hold At Key Levels; 3 Rules For A Weaker MarketStock Futures Fall; 4 Trade-War Resistant Watchlist StocksThis Dividend Stock And Gas Pipeline Play Faces Big Q2 ExpectationsIBD Stock Of The Day Forms New Base After 62% RunTime To Buy This China Growth Stock Again?

577,KEY,"Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) rocketed to a two-year high Friday after it and Celgene (CELG) reported strong results for a partnered anemia treatment called luspatercept.On the stock market today, Acceleron soared 42.8%, closing at 48.52. Celgene lifted 3.6%, to 79.42. Meanwhile, shares of other biotech companies rose. The ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology (BIB) exchange-traded fund lifted 3.5%, to 57.20.Late Thursday, the two biotech companies said luspatercept met both its key goals in a study. They tested luspatercept vs. a placebo in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. In these disorders blood cells are poorly formed or don't work well.The two biotech companies are now preparing the necessary documents to ask regulatory officials across the globe to approve luspatercept, Celgene Chief Medical Officer Jay Backstrom said in a written statement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This result from the Phase 3 (study called) Medalist demonstrates the potential clinical benefit of luspatercept as an erythroid (a red blood cell) maturation agent for the treatment of chronic anemia in patients with low-to-intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes,"" he said.Patients tested in the Medalist study had chronic anemia. Their disease also had progressed, or they were either intolerant or ineligible for another anemia treatment called an erythropoietin-stimulating agent, or ESA. Before luspatercept, they required frequent red blood cell transfusions.Luspatercept-treated patients experienced at least eight straight weeks without red blood cell transfusions during the first 24 weeks of treatment. The study also met its second goal. Patients were able to go at least 12 consecutive weeks without transfusions.Celgene and Acceleron will likely grab approval and launch in 2019, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a report to clients. He calls for worldwide sales of $170 million in 2020, increasing to $1.5 billion by 2023. Analysts, meanwhile, see $326 million and $1.2 billion, respectively.RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay boosted his expectations for luspatercept success to 95% from 90%. He calls for peak sales of $770 million in this specific patient group. Under the deal with Celgene, Acceleron will receive royalties on sales in the U.S.Though numerical details were lacking in the press release, this ""does not indicate lack of statically significant improvement,"" MacKay said in his note to clients. The biotech companies said they plan to offer more detail on the study at a future medical conference.Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster noted even reducing the frequency of transfusions for these patients would be an improvement, ""especially considering the lack of treatment options for patients with this condition.""Auster boosted his price target on Acceleron to 60 from 55. He sees a 90% likelihood luspatercept will get approval as an anemia treatment for this group of patients.The biotech companies also are considering testing luspatercept in low-to-intermediate risk patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who have never undergone ESA as an anemia treatment. Soon, the firms will also have data for luspatercept as a treatment for patients with beta-thalassemia.RBC's MacKay sees a ""high likelihood of success"" in using luspatercept to treat beta-thalassemia, a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin. This can lead to a lack of oxygen in many parts of the body, according to Genetics Home Reference.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

578,KEY,"Cutting losses quickly is critical to success in swing trading. You must have a set stop loss and the discipline to act if it hits. With China trade war headlines jostling stocks, you need to know where to put your stop loss for the protection it provides.Baozun (BZUN) had a lot to offer as a swing trade opportunity. It's a member of the computer enterprise software group, one of the top-performing groups of this year. Its last earnings report acted as a catalyst for a strong breakout (1), vaulting 20% move in the next few weeks. Rather than fretting over the missed opportunity in Baozun's move, you can look for a new opportunity in a pullback. In this case, a bullish reversal presented itself as the stock fell below 60 then powered back above it in a single day (2).Typically in a reversal, we look for the price to surpass the previous day's close to confirm the strength. The reversal day fell short in that regard. But the next day, the stock opened above the reversal day high and started making progress early in the trading day (3). Baozun joined IBD's SwingTrader at an early entry of 62.36. But before entering a trade, you need to determine where to put your stop loss.For reversals, we often look to the low of the reversal day as our stop loss. In this case, that would amount to an excessive risk for a swing trade at nearly 10%. Using the low of the entry day would normally be an acceptable alternative, but that was too tight.There seemed to be an area of support around 60 from a few weeks back on the daily chart and this matched up nicely with an area of support on the intraday chart. At over a 3% risk percentage it was on the higher side but still reasonable. You could also reduce the risk to your portfolio by adjusting your position size.Two days later, short-term market conditions worsened and Baozun hit our stop loss (4). It's not fun taking a loss, but it is a part of trading. Sure, by the end of the day the stock was above our stop loss but you don't know if it will come back when your stop loss triggers. You have to protect yourself from the loss potentially growing.The China trade war rhetoric continued the next week and Baozun fell 10% the day after we removed it from SwingTrader. It continued falling throughout the week. If you don't respect your stop loss, you set yourself up for devastating losses.It's bad enough that you reduce the capital in your portfolio. It means starting with less money for your next opportunity. But even worse is what a large loss can do to your emotional capital. You can get more timid at the next move, investing less or investing late. That's the hidden cost of big losses. Cut losses short, respect your stop losses and it will save you from a lot of costly mistakes.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED: What To Do When A Swing Trade Doesn't WorkCutting Losses Quickly Is Key To Long-Term Stock ProfitsSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

582,KEY,"I'm tired.Done in by network and cable news alike.Fried from frequenting online publications and opinion sites.Pooped in perusing breathless alerts on my devices.I've had it. And I'm not alone.A Pew Research study recently found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans suffer from ""news fatigue"" — a phenomenon even more pervasive among Republicans. The survey focused on the volume as much as the quality of the offerings.But why wouldn't the public be emotionally expended from the anger and accusations, bullying and backbiting, ""fake news"" and ""fact checks,"" insults and innuendo, posturing and protests, threats and trolling, and virtue-signaling and violent rhetoric and imagery spewed from every direction today?The truth is that an endless assault on our senses and sensibilities via the media has been a feature, not a bug, of political discourse for some time now.And my educated guess is that the reason news fatigue affects one party more is that for most of that time, one side — progressives, abetted by allies in the media — has dominated this ""perpetual outrage cycle"" to wear down opposition to once-radical ideas and erode adherence to traditional American values.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn fact, as I once observed (presciently, if I do say so myself) in the same-sex marriage context, the whole idea of the left's unabated and uninhibited assault is not to win debates. It's to extend them ad infinitum, ad absurdum and ad nauseam, alongside extortion and intimidation — until opponents lose their grip on certainty and collapse in confusion, exhaustion and disarray.It may seem that the objective in this unyielding, any-means-to-an-end onslaught is the triumph of liberal ideas. But it's really power. Progressives recognize that by deploying rage to sow social and economic chaos, they open the door for Big Government ""solutions.""Shrill put-downs of traditional sexual mores and family structures — and eternal insistence on free birth control and unregulated abortion — spawn single-parent families trapped in poverty and lacking health care. Hence extended welfare programs, expanded Medicaid and that ultimate power grab, ObamaCare. (It's no coincidence that single females frothed into perpetual frenzy over these ""women's issues"" — think ""pussyhats"" — are among the most reliable Democratic voters and the leading edge of ""Le Resistance."")Perpetration of school massacres and the transformation of inner cities into war zones by the resulting fatherless youth leads to pressure for tightened gun laws — featuring high-schoolers openly dissing elected officials on national television and in viral videos.Surrender of control of our borders — demanded by shrieking mobs waving foreign flags and scaling walls for the cameras — drives calls for even further liberalized immigration laws to accommodate children (read: future Democratic voters) smuggled here illegally. Unsurprisingly, the latest extended liberal hissy fit is over youngsters separated from parents who deliberately flaunted the law.Even worker bonuses handed out in response to the recent tax cut bill — which returns money and power to the people from Washington — prompted faux liberal fury.Not to mention high-minded sowing of gender confusion, protests over ""cultural appropriation,"" campus riots, and portrayals of ""wrong"" thinkers as heartless, bigots, racists, chauvinists, defenders of ""patriarchy"" and increasingly, as murderers. All intended to pound the ""Silent Majority"" into lethargy, lassitude and ultimately, capitulation and conformance.Admittedly, none of this is new news. So what's making my media consumption that much more exhausting these days? The adoption of these same tactics by a leader supposedly representing the opposite flank: a modern media virtuoso continually on the attack and keeping the other side — and often his own — off-kilter and out-of-sorts with a steady stream of slights, slurs, abuse and affronts to ""norms.""While it may be welcome in some quarters, to many of us on the right, the ascension of the first ""shock jock"" president is yet another jolt to already jangled nerves. And making it worse is that this ""conservative"" chief executive's triumph in occupying the progressives' rhetorical space has forced some further to the oratorical fringes — and sadly, over the edge.Hence Robert DeNiro's bleeped, out-of-context reference to the commander in chief. Samantha Bee's uncensored description of the first daughter employing decidedly unfeminist terminology. Michelle Wolf's sick White House Correspondents' Dinner monologue. Even appalling public utterances of the Raging Bull's phraseology of choice by Democratic Party leaders and elected officials. All mind-numbingly defended as a necessary response to Trump and Trumpism.I wish someone could stand athwart this downward definition of deviant speech and shut down the ugliness. But as with negative political advertising, it works: for progressives in achieving nearly all of their political and social aspirations — and for Donald Trump in seizing near-complete command of the media cycle.The only ones it doesn't seem to be working for are those 7 in 10 ""news-fatigued"" Americans — and me.So my suggestion?

585,KEY,"When's the best time to buy stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Nvidia (NVDA)? In a strong market uptrend as they break out of the kind of chart patterns that launch virtually all major moves.In this third installment of the Stock Chart Reading For Beginners series, you'll learn to spot the three most profitable chart patterns (AKA, bases): cup with handle, double-bottom and flat base.To understand what's in a stock chart and the concept behind bases, buy points and breakouts, be sure to also read the first two parts in this series:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.So as you learn to spot bases, remember that the chart action (AKA, technical analysis) is just one part of the stock-picking puzzle. Be sure to use a buying checklist to make sure all of the pieces are in place before you invest.TIP: For an even deeper understanding of how chart patterns work, read more about the concept and psychology behind bases.From IBM (IBM) in 1926 and Walmart (WMT) in 1980 to Nvidia in 2016, countless big winners have made large gains from a cup with handle in every market cycle for decades.The name comes from how the pattern looks like a teacup viewed from the side. It may be a quaint name, but it's an extremely powerful pattern. Here are the basic elements to look for:In the second part of this series on chart reading, we learned about support and resistance. The bottom of the cup with handle is an area of support (a floor), and the peak in the handle is the most recent point of resistance (a ceiling).The buy point is based on the most recent area of resistance (i.e., the peak in the handle) because it's a testing ground. Can the stock punch decisively through that resistance in heavy volume? If it does, it's a sign of strength, and a sign that large investors are buying aggressively and therefore pushing the stock higher.Note that we add 10 cents to peak of the handle to determine the buy point. We do that just to make sure the stock is pushing through that ceiling, and not just bumping its head against it.On the day of a breakout, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than the stock's daily average. Such a spike in trading is a sign of conviction. A breakout attempt on below-average volume shows a lack of enthusiasm, which could mean it's just a head fake.Nvidia Breakout From Cup With HandleWhen Nvidia delivered a classic cup-with-handle breakout in 2016, the first two pieces of the stock-picking puzzle were already in place. The stock market was in a confirmed uptrend, and Nvidia's innovative self-driving car and video-graphics technology was driving strong earnings and sales growth.The final piece — the chart action — fell into place when Nvidia formed and broke out of a cup with handle. In the chart below, note how the relative strength (RS) line was at a new high as Nvidia broke out. That is a bullish sign of market leadership that you like to see as a stock clears a buy point.Also note that Nvidia was featured in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks just before it launched that run.From the breakout, Nvidia eventually rose more than 700% over the next 27 months, forming multiple bases and additional buy points along the way.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can identify the cup with handle that Amazon formed from October 2016 to February 2017.Learn More About Cup-With-Handle PatternsThe double bottom is another pattern that repeats in every market cycle. It resembles a W, and has a choppy, seesaw look to it. Not surprisingly, double bottoms typically form when the general stock market is showing similarly volatile, roller-coaster behavior.Here's what to look for in a double bottom:Like with the cup with handle and, indeed, all chart patterns, you want to see volume come in at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a double-bottom breakout.Facebook Breakout From Double BottomLike many big-buzz IPO stocks, Facebook got off to a rocky start following its May 2012 market debut. But the social media giant bolted out of a double bottom in July 2013 as its earnings growth rebounded. In the chart below, note the huge spikes in volume as Facebook launched what eventually became a nearly 600% move over the next five years.Can You Spot The Pattern?Look at a weekly chart for Micron Technology (MU). Can you see the double bottom it formed from June to August 2017?Learn More About Double BottomsAs the name implies, a flat base is shallower than a cup with handle or double bottom. It's also shorter, taking just five weeks to form. You'll often find stocks will form a flat base after breaking out of a cup with handle or double bottom. Think of it like a brief resting period after a quick sprint. A stock jumps out of a cup with handle or double bottom, then pauses to form a flat base before resuming its climb.Here are the key elements of a flat base:Netflix Breakout From Flat BaseNetflix formed a six-week-long flat base beginning in June 2017. The streaming giant flew out of that pattern the next month, but quickly pulled back to form a cup with handle.

592,KEY,"Oil dropped the most in almost three weeks Thursday after a surprise increase in American stockpiles and moves by Saudi Arabia to cool a rally that's drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.XFutures fell 1.6% in New York following a government report showing U.S. crude inventories climbed 1.25 million barrels last week as imports rose and exports fell. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had been expecting a median 5 million-barrel decrease as supplies typically decline this time of year amid strong demand from refiners.At the same time, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. lowered August pricing for most crude grades in Asia and Europe and cut them all in the U.S. a day after Trump called on OPEC to ""REDUCE PRICING NOW!"" in a tweet Wednesday. The kingdom was also said to have increased daily output by about half a million barrels in June.The market was expecting ""higher exports and lower imports, but we got the reverse,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise, which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets.Crude hit a three-year high of $75.27 on Tuesday as the outlook for less supply from Iran, Libya and Venezuela overshadows a pledge by OPEC and its allies to boost output by 1 million barrels a day. Inventories at the key U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, have declined for the seventh straight week.West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery fell $1.20 to settle at $72.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close in a week. There was no settlement Wednesday due to the U.S. holiday.Brent for September settlement slid 85 cents to end the session at $77.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a $6.76 premium to WTI for the same month.In the U.S., crude imports rose to the highest level since February 2017, with crude coming from Canada at the highest on record. Meanwhile, crude exports fell by the most since mid-May. The EIA also reported refinery utilization ticked lower for the first time since early May. Gasoline supplies declined, while distillate stockpiles rose.In addition to cutting prices, Saudi Arabia told OPEC it pumped about 10.5 million barrels of crude a day last month as the kingdom sought to cap rallying prices by ramping up output, according to people familiar with the matter. The June figure would represent an increase of about 500,000 barrels a day from May.As OPEC and its allies implement their new agreement, the market will have to see how much oil Saudi Arabia will send onto the marketplace, said James Williams, president of London, Arkansas-based energy researcher WTRG Economics.

595,KEY,"Less than a month after the Trump administration declared that the China trade war was ""on hold,"" it appears to be back on. And this time, there may be no turning back.President Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of mostly high-tech imports that will be subject to 25% tariffs. Some $34 billion will go into effect on July 6. China on Friday announced tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods, including agricultural goods. It's vowed to match U.S. tariffs swiftly and dollar for dollar.Trump had threatened more tariffs if China retaliates.What happens next will determine how big of a deal Trump's China trade war is for the economy and stock market. Yet there's clear risk that the conflict will escalate into a technological cold war.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow Jones, down more than 1% at one point, pared its loss to 0.3% on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index slid 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite 0.2%.Tariffs on $34 billion in goods will take effect July 6. The other $16 billion are still subject to review.Once shots are fired, trade talks will get more difficult. The Trump administration says it has almost finished drawing up a list of another $100 billion of Chinese goods that could also face tariffs.Commodities prices for soybeans, corn and wheat have taken a hit ahead of the expected imposition of tariffs, while shares of Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers are doing well, slid close to 5% in the past two days. That's quite a reversal after Trump's May 21 tweet touting an emerging trade deal that would see China ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.So what happened? Trump may have concluded that the deal would have done relatively little to meet his goal of shrinking the U.S. trade deficit. After his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, Trump might feel his denuclearization push isn't so dependent upon China.Here's another possibility: Trump may have been bullied into the trade war. While the Trump administration has insisted that the enforcement action against Chinese communications equipment supplier ZTE was separate from the trade negotiation, it's not clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed.The brief but favorable turn in China trade relations came after Trump tweeted that he and Xi were working to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" That's after U.S. sanctions forced the Chinese telecom gear maker to cease operations. As punishment for continuing to doing business with Iran and North Korea in defiance of U.S. sanctions against those regimes, the Commerce Department ordered ZTE's key U.S. component suppliers to cease doing business with the firm.But Trump's leniency prompted a backlash. The Senate appears certain to attach a provision denying relief to ZTE to a defense funding bill. While the White House opposes that provision, it's unclear that Trump would veto must-pass defense legislation over the matter.With the fate of ZTE hanging in the balance, Chinese trade negotiators have frustrated their American counterparts. That, in turn, has strengthened the hand of Trump administration officials who have advocated taking a hard line against China and had the tariffs all ready to go.One ray of hope that a damaging trade war can be averted: China has reportedly granted approval to Qualcomm (QCOM) to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Chinese regulators appeared to delay approval amid the ZTE furor. But some reports said that China hasn't yet OK'd Qualcomm-NXP Semi.Qualcomm rose 0.7% Friday while NXP advanced 0.1%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Jones Futures Fall As Trump Steps Up China Trade War; Watch These Key StocksIBD Stock Of The Day: Dropbox Breaks Out As Software IPOs SurgeWhy This Biotech Is Bounding Closer To A BreakoutChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

596,KEY,"A tweetstorm from the tarmac of the Quebec ""G-6+1"" summit has escalated the U.S.-Canada trade war to a new level, and the snark since then from both sides of the border seems headed for DefCon 1. Thus far, the focus has been on U.S.-imposed trade tariffs on Canadian-made aluminum and steel, and their economic impact. Of potentially greater concern: the damage the tariffs may do to the U.S. defense industrial base.The linkage is more than metaphorical; it's enshrined in U.S. and Canadian law. Unlike any of America's other allies, Canada has long been part of a special relationship, linking the two country's defense industrial bases as one.The defense union dates back to the months preceding America's entry into World War II: In 1941, FDR and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King agreed to allow American-made war materiel produced in Canada to flow to embattled Britain under Lend-Lease. As the war wore on, Canadian aluminum production ramped up at the massive Saguenay, Quebec, complex, eventually accounting for 40% of all allied aluminum production.U.S.-Canada industrial collaboration continued through the Cold War and beyond. Twenty-five years ago, the U.S. federal code formally recognized Canada as a part of the U.S. National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) for national security and defense planning purposes.As a result, our two countries share the world's most integrated defense industrial base. And in a nod to our long alliance, the Canadian air base at Bagotville, Quebec — built in 1942 to protect the aluminum production facilities during World War II — is today part of the joint U.S.-Canadian North-American Air Defense network, better known as NORAD.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut with the imposition of aluminum and steel tariffs on Canada, all of this rich history raises a question: How is it that the Trump administration has chosen a path that threatens a trade war with our closest defense ally — at precisely the time that the president has rightly shined a spotlight on American shortfalls in 35 critical minerals and metals essential, in the words of the White House executive order, to the ""U.S. economy and national security""?And aluminum is clearly one. Not only alphabetically, as on the newly promulgated U.S. Government Critical Minerals List, but as the No. 1 material by annual DoD usage. Even more concerning, a shortage of aluminum metal was cited in a nonclassified defense study as having ""already caused some kind of significant weapon system production delay for DoD."" Subjecting U.S. aluminum access, when China possesses more than half the world's aluminum smelting capacity, to trade tensions with our ally Canada is a national security crisis waiting to happen.Strong supply lines with our core allies are essential to the surge capacity the U.S. would need in time of rising tensions or outright conflict.Take bauxite ore, the essential precursor for aluminum production. While the U.S. has no bauxite deposits, Australia — added alongside Canada in 2017 as part of the U.S. defense industrial base — hosts five bauxite mines, and outpaces China as the world's largest bauxite producer. In other words, the production progression from bauxite to aluminum to steel depends on a defense industrial base supply chain running from Australia to Canada to the U.S.In our interconnected world, keeping open and unencumbered supply lines with our key allies for critical materials should be a bedrock principle for U.S. national security.So by all means, U.S. trade officials should sort out new rules for tariff reform and fairer trade. But let's make sure critical national security materials like aluminum don't get caught in the crossfire. With Canada's integral place in the U.S. defense industrial base, the U.S. can't afford to damage our joint ability to defend the peace by triggering a trade war with our closest defense ally.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

""We've only just scratched the surface here.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAladdin is the linchpin of BlackRock's fast-growing technology business. Chief Executive Larry Fink has said he hopes technology will power 30% of the firm's revenue by 2022, though he said last year that would be a ""giant reach."" Winning over brokers and investment advisors will give the firm a huge platform from which to sell mutual funds and ETFs — and expand its already vast, some say alarming, influence in finance.BlackRock has a long way to go in wealth management. While about 20% of the top 200 global asset managers use the software, it's only reached 2% of the global private wealth industry, according to the company.The creation of Aladdin — short for Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network — dates back almost as far as BlackRock itself. At first, the firm used it solely as an internal tool. It's often called the firm's ""central nervous system"" because the software analyzes the $6.3 trillion investment firm's every move. It monitors all of BlackRock's portfolios, weighing what-ifs and worst-case scenarios, and even handles tasks like tracking corporate head count.Today, outside firms and competitors license the software to 30,000 users in 50 countries, according to the company. In addition to asset managers, other clients using Aladdin include the largest U.S. pension funds, CalSTRS and CalPERS, and some of the top insurers. Even competitor Vanguard Group uses Aladdin to supplement some of its in-house risk-monitoring tools, according to a Vanguard spokesperson.The asset manager first got the idea to start licensing the product in the 1990s, during the U.S. recession, according to Goldstein, a 24-year veteran of the company. Wall Street firms asked BlackRock to examine their portfolios, giving the company an idea: it could sell the technology to other industry players and competitors.""We had built an X-ray machine, and there were a lot of people who felt like something didn't feel right and they needed an X-ray,"" Goldstein said in an interview.In total, Aladdin watches over a vast sum, rivaling the U.S. gross domestic product of more than $18 trillion.BlackRock's more recent plan grew out of an internal hackathon about three years ago. Engineers paved the way for a new product, called Aladdin for Wealth, which flipped the business model. While the traditional Aladdin software examines data on millions of securities for large accounts, the wealth product helps brokers and investment advisors analyze client accounts invested in a more limited pool of securities, such as mutual funds.Andy Saperstein, co-head of Morgan Stanley's wealth-management unit, has said that using the software will help scour client portfolios for ""risks that they didn't even know they were taking.""That's an area it can mine for opportunity. If Aladdin spots gaps or undue risk in a portfolio, BlackRock can be in a good position to promote — and sell — its products, especially low-fee ETFs and index funds that clients on Main Street crave.""This is something more holistic, which is where the industry's going,"" said Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""There's more demand for that now than there was five or 10 years ago.""BlackRock has also decided for the first time to open up part of the platform to engineers within its client organizations too, in an effort to further embed the software in their day-to-day business. Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, sells financial software that competes on certain fronts with Aladdin.Competitors say Aladdin is becoming its own kind of risk. One recurring criticism of the software is that it could lead to a kind of groupthink about risk. With hundreds of clients relying on it, Aladdin could gravitate toward similar conclusions or fail to recognize common blind spots, critics contend.SimCorp of Copenhagen sells risk software that competes with Aladdin. Its chief executive, Klaus Holse, said some of his clients shun Aladdin because they ""don't want to enter into the systemic risk of being with BlackRock. If that for some reason fails, then everyone fails.""Some SimCorp clients have raised concerns about BlackRock because they ""don't want to fund a competitor,"" he said.BlackRock's Goldstein said such criticism is unfounded as Aladdin isn't a one-size-fits-all risk tool. Each customer uses it in distinctive ways and rather than dictating behavior, it functions more like ""a dashboard, in terms of how people drive a car,"" he said.The software is crucial to the asset manager's future, he added. Hoping to impress that upon shareholders at investor day, Goldstein stood in front of a giant projection screen that displayed the words ""ALADDIN IS BLACKROCK.""""Aladdin and technology are core to everything we do,"" he said.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Amazon, Netflix Lead Tech Stocks As Key Index Hits Record High7 Key Ways To Check If The Stock Market Is HealthyWall Street Wants To Know If The Fed Will Boost Bank Stocks

599,KEY,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Friday: What you need to know as an investor for the coming day. The June jobs report, often a stock market mover, could take a back seat to big news of the day — possibly the first big shots in the China trade war as Trump tariffs are set to hit at the stroke of midnight.If the Trump tariffs do kick in at midnight Eastern Time, adding 25% to $34 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports, Beijing is set to immediately retaliate — dollar for dollar — with tariffs on U.S. autos and agriculture.Stocks have fallen in recent weeks on Trump trade war fears. So it's unclear how the major averages and key sectors will react if the China tariffs go into effect, or not.But the broader implications are huge. If the tariffs take effect, then the U.S. will be at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing from which there may be no turning back. If they're off the table or on hold, then Wall Street will heave a sigh of relief, knowing that Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChina right now is set to slap a further 25% tariff on U.S.-built cars and SUVs. That will hit Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA) and others. Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) already warned that profits on Alabama-built SUVs will suffer. Chinese tariffs on U.S. agriculture, including soybeans, would indirectly hit Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers rake in profits.LED maker Cree will be among the U.S. companies hit by the Trump tariffs after the Trump administration turned down its request for an exemption. Cree (CREE) warned that the tariffs would limit its R&D spending and planned manufacturing expansion.Trump tariffs hitting U.S. semiconductor makers will come in the next batch of $16 billion worth of goods targeted. Those tariffs still face a final review, but their likelihood will rise markedly if the first round of tariffs takes effect.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL). China has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Economists expect the June employment report to show the U.S. added 190,000 jobs last month as the unemployment rate held at 3.8%. The Labor Department report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.Average hourly earnings is the big number to watch. Expect annual wage growth to tick up to 2.8%. That would match the best pay gain since 2009.Costco (COST) boosted its starting wage by $1 and other wages by 25-50 cents an hour effective June 11. That followed wage hikes earlier this year by Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Kroger (KR) and more.Rising wage growth would offer more evidence that the historical link between lower unemployment and higher pay is still intact. Higher wages, in turn, are expected to fuel higher inflation. Any upside surprise in wages will boost odds of a third and fourth Fed hike this year, as long as rising trade war fears don't curb economic enthusiasm.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:As Trump Tariffs Hit, The U.S. Is Losing The China Trade War — Big TimeThese Auto Stocks Rev Higher; Is Trump Tariffs 'Ploy' Working?Breakout Watch: IBD 50 List Stock With 171% Growth Stock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchChart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart Patterns

600,KEY,"Leadership isn't about being the person who has all the answers. Quite the opposite. There's nothing wrong with asking for input, seeking help and admitting you don't know it all. It pays to show you're vulnerable.""A leader who acts like he has all the answers isn't approachable,"" said Steve Arneson, who runs his own Boulder, Colo.-based executive coaching and leadership consulting firm. ""But if you're open-minded and not afraid to ask for help, then people know they have the opportunity to weigh in.""Here's how to build that environment.Get participation. Make sure your people are involved in key decisions. Seek help, input and feedback. Say you're looking at both sides of an issue and want to hear what they think.""You have to get past, 'I have all the answers,'"" Arneson said.Set aside ego. Confidence is vital for a leader. But that doesn't mean you know everything. Arneson said the most confident leaders are also often the most likely to show they're vulnerable. They're not afraid to open up, even about their faults.Gain strength. The power inside people can only truly be unleashed if they bring everything they have to their role, says Barry Kaplan, a partner in New York-area executive coaching firm Shift 180. Openness plays a big role.""That includes talking about things that might be dangerous or risky,"" Kaplan, co-author of ""The Power of Vulnerability,"" told IBD.Be clear. Build an open and trusting environment by first talking about it. When Kaplan works with companies, he often has people write down something they haven't shared before but that's important to the business. It might be about saving money or why one person hasn't been fired. Then talk about that point in a forum where there is no fear of retribution.""There's a lot of pent-up truth that's ready to be unleashed,"" Kaplan said. ""There's courage involved in being vulnerable and speaking my truth. But if I'm authentic it makes me feel good about myself.""Stay true. Be consistent in how you act and treat people. And stick to your values while doing that.""That produces a track record of behavior that people can bank on,"" Arneson said. ""Then when they walk in on Monday morning, they know who they're getting.""Spread the word. Build authenticity into your group's culture by displaying it yourself, so others see it starts at the top. Talk about it every chance you get: in meetings, through a CEO blog and at employee celebrations.""The cool thing about authenticity is you don't have to think about it,"" Arneson said. ""It just comes naturally.""Win faith. If you're open about your weaknesses, you'll earn trust among your team.""Then you'll create a powerful team because people will have each other's back,"" Kaplan said.Take the lead. If the company chief doesn't show vulnerability and authenticity, others won't either. But if she does, it'll spread fast.Kaplan once worked with the leader of an auto parts company who was at a crossroads about whether to shut the doors or keep investing. The boss spoke openly to his people about his dilemma. They opened up about their fears and their staunch belief the company could recover from its slump. The boss decided to invest more in the company.""His people believed more in him because he was willing to say, 'I don't know,'"" Kaplan said. ""He couldn't have been more real. And they ended up having their best year ever.""Reap rewards. Once you open up to the point that you build trust, the benefits pour in.""Then you have an environment that's going to lead to improved performance,"" Kaplan said. ""One new idea leads to creativity and innovation, or you can cut your losses earlier if your company was going to do something that doesn't work.""

603,KEY,"Baozun, a May 2015 new issue, has waged a terrific run-up ever since it cleared a super-deep bottoming base at 9.99 during the week ended Aug. 26, 2016. How long can its rally last?And more importantly, how much impact could the China-U.S. trade dispute have on the company's fundamentals?To answer the first question, it's really key to learn how to count bases.After a stock breaks out of a sound chart pattern, watch to see if rises 20% or more. If it does, the next serious decline begins the process of a new base.What if a stock rises just 15% from the proper buy point, then settles into a new base? Put another way: You find a stock that launches out of a cup with handle, breaks out, goes up 15%, but then forms a flat base on top of that cup? In most cases, both bases count as one entire base. IBD calls it simply a base on base.Going back to Baozun (BZUN), the stock nearly doubled in price and hit all-time highs after that first breakout in 2016. Base No. 2 was also quite deep, but Baozun cleared a 17.68 entry during the week ended May 5, 2017. That breakout spawned a 130% advance.Baozun formed two more bases, one from September 2017 and another from March 2018. These two bases showed big weekly price swings. But the breakout from these bases showed hefty volume, a good sign.Some late-stage breakouts can work, even if there's higher risk of failure, when a company has truly excellent fundamentals and solid institutional sponsorship.This week, the stock has fallen to the 10-week moving average for the first time since its May 17 breakout. A first or second rebound off the 10-week line offers investors a fresh opportunity to buy shares. Risk is higher now with the market's outlook downgraded by IBD on Monday to ""uptrend under pressure.""During a rally off the 10-week line, look for a swell in turnover. A strong price gain in heavy volume signals solid institutional demand. Try to buy as close as possible to the 10-week line, or in this case, near 55.70.Contrast Baozun's action to fellow Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW). The latter dropped briefly below its 50-day moving average on Friday, then closed beneath the line on Monday. Volume hasn't been overly intense, however. On Monday, ServiceNow saw trading volume increase merely 3% above average.To answer the second question, on the U.S.-China trade dispute, it's key to study recent numbers.Baozun, the expert in e-commerce markets in the second largest economy, has superior earnings gains. According to IBD Leaderboard, the average EPS increase over the past three quarters is 58%. The Street sees earnings rising 27% in the second quarter.In Q1, the Shanghai-based firm reported a profit 0f 9 cents per share, a penny above the consensus forecast. Revenue has jumped 24%, 19%, 31% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.According to a May 17 news release, Baozun said the number of its brand partners rose to 156 as of March 31 from 125 the same time a year earlier. Officials do not make clear how many of those partners are American corporations. One can surmise that many of its brand partners are East Asian companies. For instance, Baozun established a wholly owned subsidiary in October 2014 to expand its e-commerce services to the Taiwan market.In October 2015, Baozun started a 100%-owned unit aiming to introduce more Japanese brands to Chinese consumers. And in September 2016, it launched a joint venture with a division of the South Korean culture and lifestyle conglomerate CJ Group ""to introduce highly sought-after Korean brands to Chinese consumers,"" according to a filing with the SEC.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:The Bull Market Gets A Bloody Nose; Watch For This Critical Sell Signal5 Reasons Why This Market Uptrend Is Still StrongThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner: This Should Happen On Breakout DayHow Many Chinese Companies Make The IBD 50 Today?

606,KEY,"The monthly IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a collaboration of Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, gauges how confident consumers, workers and investors are in the pace and direction of the U.S. economy. As with all of IBD/TIPP's proprietary monthly indexes, a reading above 50 signals optimism, below 50 pessimism.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is made up of three subindexes, including one for the respondent's outlook six months into the future, the respondent's personal financial outlook, and how the respondent views current federal policies. The goal each month is to give as accurate a reading of the current state of the economy as possible.The average for the index over the past 17 years has been 49.4, or slightly pessimistic. The index high of 62.9 was reached in March of 2002, six months after the 9/11 attacks, as Americans rallied behind the U.S. response to the terrorist attacks and confidence grew that the post-9/11 economy would not go into recession as widely feared. The index bottomed in August 2011 at 35.8, as the economy struggled to emerge from the financial crisis and key initiatives to boost economic growth had yet to have an impact.IBD/TIPP also produces the Presidential Leadership Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index saw a sharp 4.6% gain to 56.4 in July.  This is the third straight gain for the index, and the second highest it's been since October 2004. It also marks the 22nd straight month that Economic Optimism Index has been over 50 — which signals overall optimism about the economy — a record run for this index. It is also well above its long-term average of 49.4. The index stood at 44.4 in December 2007, the month that the U.S. officially entered a recession.The Six-Month Outlook is a forward-looking gauge that looks at how consumers feel about the economy's prospects over the next half year. The index climbed 4.3% to 53.4. in July. The volatile gauge surged 11.4% in January, and then bounced up and down for several months. The reading for this index remains in optimistic territory and well above its long-term average of 46.3. This index stood at 32.1 in December 2007, the month the economy fell into recession.The gauge of how Americans feel about their own finances in the next six months rose another 1.1% in July to 62.8, which marks the third straight monthly increase. The index's all-time high of 65.3 was set in January 2004, when the Bush-era tax cuts began to kick in. It jumped this January, the month President Trump's tax cuts went into effect. The Personal Financial Outlook is the most consistently optimistic index in the IBD/TIPP data set. It remains above its long-term average of 57.1.A measure of Americans' confidence in government, the Federal Policies component shot up nearly 10%, from 48.3 in June to 52.9 in July. That's the highest it's been in nearly 12 years and well above its 17-year average of 44.8. This index briefly moved into optimistic territory in February 2017 for the first time in 10 years, and in March of this year returned to that feel-good zone. Intended to gauge how Americans view government policies put in place by the president, Congress, the courts and the Federal Reserve, the Federal Policies Index has consistently been the least optimistic of the three subindexes that make up the Economic Optimism Index.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Presidential Approval IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsJune 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016Media ContactTerry Jones

614,KEY,"There are lots of short-term solutions to address the wave of immigrants who have swarmed the border in an effort to enter the U.S. illegally.Why not use the thousands of currently half-empty residence halls at American colleges and universities to help house families from Central America and Mexico who await adjudication of their asylum claims? The federal government could contract out to universities such as UCLA, Stanford, Cal-Berkeley and large public universities in Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico to offer migrants temporary summertime shelter and sustenance. Law schools could offer pro bono legal counseling, and medical schools could offer health services.Such multifaceted help from institutes of higher education would be particularly apt — and far better than using military bases. The vast housing, recreational and meal-service infrastructures of colleges are often underutilized in summer. Campuses are also bastions of liberal activism, proud both of their diversity and their expertise in dealing with sensitive matters of acculturation.What better first glimpse of America could be offered to immigrants than the energy, pastoral beauty and hospitality of a quiet college quad or well-maintained residence hall?It also makes no sense for college students to venture far and wide for internships when they could be enlisted on campus over the summer to tutor children from Central America and to monitor their safety and treatment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIf progressives believe that sovereignty and border enforcement are passe notions, then they should at least match their rhetoric with concrete solutions. In California, there are ongoing existential crises with homelessness, unaffordable housing and dismal public schools that rate near bottom of national surveys.How could California square its present circle of being both the most impoverished and affluent of states — the most callous in fact, the most caring in theory?Why not cease the current stampede to private academies that has left the public schools of the greater coastal corridor non-diverse and near-apartheid?The huge Los Angeles Unified School District is now over 70% Latino, as whites and Asians have fled the arrival of immigrant children. It's much the same in Silicon Valley, where private prep schools are expanding enrollments to meet the demand from the affluent members of the tech industry.Yet scholarly studies show that immigration works best when new arrivals are fully ingratiated into diverse schools, neighborhoods and social activities.The huge, multibillion-dollar market capitalizations of West Coast giants such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Yahoo have so far not led to more affordable housing, more diverse top-flight public K-12 schools, or a growing middle class energized by new arrivals from Mexico and Central America.Instead, despite the rhetoric of inclusion, and televised and tweeted fury at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the progressive left coast is among the most exclusionary of all American communities.Zoning and environmental laws drive immigrants into enclaves and ghettoes. Gentrification ends up in the eviction of the first-generation immigrant poor from already overpriced rental units.It is almost as if the louder one rails about unfair border enforcement, the more likely one is to avoid encounters with illegal immigrants. Outrage has become a safe way for elites to signal their virtue, acting out in theory what they are uncomfortable doing in fact.One of the strangest scenes in impoverished rural Fresno County, where I live, is the epidemic of substandard housing. Almost every small old farmhouse now has trailers and shacks tacked on to them — all substandard and not meeting codes — to accommodate recent waves of new immigrants from Mexico and Central America.Yet the media often showcase the huge gated homes and enclaves of Silicon Valley, Hollywood and the journalistic elite. Surely some of all that unused square footage and those guest houses could be used to offer at least temporary hospitality to those in need.Actor Peter Fonda could do far better to help immigrants than by tweeting threats to 12-year-old Barron Trump from his most non-diverse ranch in Paradise Valley, Montana. Instead, Fonda might advocate that Hollywood actors live among newly arrived immigrants, associate with them as equals rather than as the help, and promote public schools by ensuring that their own children and grandchildren attend them.Better yet, why doesn't Fonda invite a few of the immigrant families awaiting word on their legal status to the open spaces of his Montana ranch? Media accounts of his expansive and tasteful digs show an infrastructure that easily could accommodate a few needy immigrant families.It is easy to invoke the Nazis and the Holocaust to express anger at the temporary detention of children and their families who have entered the U.S. illegally. It would be far more meaningful if marquee journalists, actors, academics and activists knew immigrants not just as a distant abstract cause, or as nannies and landscapers, but as their neighbors, their children's school friends — and as their social equals.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate MongeringSeparating Families At The Border: The Hysteria Overlooks Some Key Facts

615,KEY,"You can take this to the bank: Millennials are optimistic about how to become rich. Exhibit A? Fifty-three percent of millennials expect to become a millionaire — or are one already. That self-confidence about how to become rich is even more pronounced among male millennials. An astounding 73% of them expect to become millionaires or already have reached that goal. Still, there's nothing wrong with aiming high. So the key question is, How can millennials achieve their aim of amassing $1 million?Experts do in fact offer roadmaps for how to become rich. One way that millennials — who range from 21 to 37 years of age, brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) says — can build their wealth is by investing in assets that grow — not just park them in a piggy bank, where they do nothing. Another step millennials should take, one expert says, is to limit how much advice they take from the, you know, ""experts.""""You can learn a lot from your peers, not just from older 'experts',"" said Ian Rosen, CEO of StockTwits, an online community of nearly 2 million investors and traders, the bulk of whom are millennials. StockTwits members help educate each other by sharing more than 200,000 messages per day about markets and investing.Rosen says that many millennials are jaded about so-called experts, who were the high priests of the financial industry and nearly broke the global economy during the Great Recession, enriching themselves while financially hurting millennials' parents and grandparents. ""Given those things, younger people have taken the opportunity to learn on their own (about personal finance and investing) and from each other.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""Retirement is more important than vacations. It's that simple.""Why does that matter? ""Time is money,"" Benjamin Franklin said. One reason that's true is because of compound earnings. The more time something can grow, the more it can compound. ""Time is one of your easiest and most powerful investment tools,"" Kinahan said. ""Don't waste it.""""Paying off debt is essential to becoming a millionaire,"" Kinahan said. Since credit card debt charges very high interest, shop around for a balance-transfer card that would charge you less. Also, pay down the balance on whichever credit card charges the highest interest. And if you pay off debt in minimum monthly installments, be sure to pay down principal as well as interest so that you eventually get rid of the balance.Yet 50% of millennials don't invest in the stock market. ""Many millennials don't realize that investing in an equity mutual fund means you're investing in stocks,"" Kinahan said. ""And broad ETFs and mutual funds are a good way to start.

616,KEY,"Governance: Conservatives are celebrating a number of important victories at the Supreme Court, as well as the chance to replace moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy. But none of these wins would have been possible if the Never-Trump crowd had its way. How about a mea culpa?Over the past few days, the Court ruled against forced union dues that fatten public sector unions and provide a gravy train of campaign cash to Democrats. It ruled that President Trump's restrictions on travel from terror-prone countries was constitutional. The court upheld Ohio's right to clean up its voter registration rolls. It said that states can't force pro-life organizations to advertise abortion services.All were landmark decisions that upheld core conservative principles. And each came down to a 5-4 vote, with Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch casting the deciding vote.In fact, of the 13 cases decided by a 5-4 margin this term, Gorsuch himself wrote five of the opinions.Liberals currently freaking out about these cases understand the importance of Gorsuch's appointment, as well as Trump's role in getting him there.Recall that when Justice Scalia died suddenly in 2016, President Obama named liberal Judge Merrick Garland as his replacement. Senate Republicans blocked Garland from getting a hearing, arguing that voters should have the chance to weigh in when they voted in the presidential elections.So, everyone knew the stakes in the November election. A vote for Hillary Clinton meant a liberal majority on the court. A vote for Trump at least provided the hope that conservatives would retain their tentative majority.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet despite the importance of replacing Scalia with another conservative, the Never-Trump crowd refused to support his presidential campaign. The list, by the way, is surprisingly long (Wikipedia has an entire page devoted to it) and includes hundreds of governors, senators, congressmen, state and local officials, and conservative pundits. Many of them outright backed Hillary Clinton.What's more, just after the court ended its session, Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his plans to retire. That means Trump can replace moderate Kennedy with a more reliably conservative justice. Before his first term is up, Trump may also be able to replace the ailing liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.In other words, Trump has the chance to decisively shift the balance of the court — something most Never-Trump Republicans have been dreaming about for decades.We admit that we, too, had our doubts about Trump during the primaries. Our concern was that, given his past positions and writings, Trump was one of the least reliably conservative candidates among the huge field of contenders.Once he won the nomination, however, it became clear that, for all his faults, he'd be far preferable to Hillary Clinton.Then, to our surprise — and many on the right — Trump went on to achieve more for conservatives in just over a year than President Reagan did in his first term, or George W. Bush in eight years.Trump secured huge pro-growth tax cuts, embarked on an aggressive regulatory rollback, neutered the out-of-control EPA, achieved a swift victory over ISIS, named a huge number of conservative judges, tried to gain some measure of control over the country's borders, chipped away at ObamaCare, and partially rolled back the disastrous Dodd-Frank act.He's been unwavering in his willingness to stand up to partisan hacks in the media — another huge win for conservatives. And, free trade aside, Trump continues to aggressively push a free-market conservative agenda against increasingly fierce and violent liberal attacks.Despite all this, legions of Never-Trumpers still wish he weren't in office. George Will even penned a column last week urging Republicans to hand control of Congress over to Democrats, to ""protect"" the country until Trump is out of office.This is madness. You don't have to like Trump — or agree with everything he does — to be glad that he's calling the shots in the White House today, and not Hillary Clinton.Separating Families At The Border: The Hysteria Overlooks Some Key FactsThanks To Tax Cuts, Companies' Overseas Profits Now Flooding Back To U.S.The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate Mongering

617,KEY,"Homebuilder stocks could be set to take another battering after an analyst warned of a slowdown in housing sales.XSpring selling season has got off to a weak start, a bad sign as it is a key period for the housing industry for both new- and existing-home sales.CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon believes the fact that home orders are not breaking new highs amid a strong economy could lead to lower revenue growth for homebuilders in the second half of 2018 and 2019.""While the spring selling season lasts through June, the data points we see so far are not encouraging,"" Leon said in a research note. ""In fact, the most recent releases confirm our key take-away that homebuilders are seeing higher pricing gains, but lower order unit growth.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe singled out KB Home (KBH), Taylor Morrison Home Corp. (TMHC) and Toll Bros. (TOL) as stocks that could struggle amid market challenges. The sector's recent struggles also saw LGI Home (LGIH) drop out of the prestigious IBD 50 stock list.However, D.R. Horton (DHI), due to its more diversified offerings and geographical markets, could flourish.Homebuilder stocks were the top market group in 2017, nearly doubling in value. But they've been stock-market laggards in 2018 as mortgage rates have climbed along with Treasury yields, which are getting a boost from expectations for faster inflation.The Building-Residential/Commercial group now sits in 184th place among the 197 industries that IBD tracks, after topping the list in 2017.According to Leon, order growth will have to rebound from mid-single digits to high-single-digit-to-low teen range in both units and order value to suggest the market is as robust as 2017. However, he is skeptical due to the late stage of the economic cycle.Government data suggest new-home sales are slowing down. In addition, confidence among homebuilders is falling, despite higher pricing gains helping to at least partially offset lower order unit growth.Mortgage rates are another headwind. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has hit 4.6%, an eight-year high.There is still a chance the booming jobs market could help buck the trend. Since President Donald Trump took office, the economy has added 2.7 million jobs, and since his tax cuts took effect there has been an average 200,000 new jobs each month. There has yet to be an accompanying jump in wages though.""Risks to our more cautious views on the housing market and new home starts would be strong job and wage income growth with mortgage rates flat to down, near 4.5%, in the next twelve months,"" Leon said. ""A slower rate of price increases would also be relief to affordability, especially in more expensive coastal markets like Seattle and (California).""And while homebuilders are skeptical, last month consumer confidence in housing was at an all-time high, according to Fannie Mae.The government-sponsored mortgage provider's Home Purchase Sentiment Index showed the confidence of those who think home prices will move even higher rose the most, while those who think it is a good time to sell came in second.The only group that reported a drop in confidence was those who think it's a good time to buy.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Analysts Bullish On Homebuilder Stocks Despite Dip — Here's WhyLGI Homes Crushed Earnings Views With Stock Already In Buy ZoneStill Bullish On Bitcoin?

This means they could become resistant to the drugs.""We think concerns over potential for resistance emergence with real-world use will limit the adoption of this dual regimen,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.

Virological failure occurs when the treatment doesn't sufficiently suppress the virus.But ""key details such as the rates of virological failure, which would be important to understand how competitively this regimen behaves, were not yet disclosed,"" Abrahams said. Glaxo said to expect further data at an upcoming medical conference.From a real-world perspective, it will be important to look at patients who didn't always take their medicine, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a report.Abrahams notes it's in ViiV's best interest to push a two-drug regimen. The biotech previously tested a three-medicine combination that included abacavir. Abacavir had safety issues including hypersensitivity and the potential for cardiovascular risks.""Gilead's triple regimens, such as Biktarvy, do not share these liabilities,"" he said.

It's hitting price levels not seen since January 2007.Judging from Monday's action, the buyers aren't tired yet.While the stock is now extended sharply past a 13.95 buy point in a large, deep double-bottom base, it may be worth keeping the stock on the watch list. Here are two reasons.One, a stock that rises that many weeks in a row is showing something special. Fund managers are serious about accumulating the stock. No wonder that AMD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has also shot up to an A+ as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.Two, fundamentals are getting white-hot at the Intel (INTC) rival in CPUs.Advanced Micro, which incorporated in 1969, ended two years of red ink by earning 13 cents a share last year. The Street sees earnings soaring 246% to 45 cents a share this year and rising another 33% to 60 cents in 2019.What's powering that solid profitability? Big sales. In the first quarter, Advanced Micro posted a 40% jump in revenue to $1.65 billion. That increase topped growth of 19%, 26% and 21% in the prior three quarters.Q1 gross margin jumped 400 basis points vs. the year-ago quarter to 36%, and the Santa Clara, Calif., company cut its operating expense as a ratio of sales from 33% to 29%.""PC, gaming and datacenter adoption of our new, high-performance products continues to accelerate,"" CEO Lisa Su said in a news release. Advanced Micro is clearly gaining traction in the area of GPUs, or graphics processors. The firm's computing and graphics segment vaulted 95% to $1.12 billion, offsetting a 12% slide in sales in the enterprise, embedded and semi-custom business unit.At this point, it would make sense to watch for the stock to take a rest and flash a follow-on entry point. Wait for the stock's first pullback to the 10-week moving average. This could take a while. The 10-week moving average is rising rapidly. But at 13.40, it's sharply below the current share price.A three-weeks-tight pattern would offer another potential follow-on buy point. But so far, there's no such formation.Elsewhere in stocks today, Estee Lauder (EL) cooled off on Monday after gaining more than 3% in each of the prior two weeks. Those gains enabled the cosmetics giant to rise past a 151.85 buy point in a nicely symmetrical cup with handle.The 5% buy zone goes up to 159.44.Autodesk (ADSK) muscled past a 141.36 buy point in a 14-week flat base that showed a mild correction of 14% from head to toe.

While such a deal might still happen, trade tensions with China are likely to intensify this week as the U.S. gets set to announce investment restrictions meant to keep key technology out of Beijing's hands.Meanwhile, Trump is threatening to slap 20% tariffs on U.S. auto imports from Germany and the rest of Europe, which would dramatically escalate the conflict.Harley said in a Monday filing that EU tariffs on its motorcycles built in the U.S. just jumped from 6% to 31%, adding roughly $2,200 to the cost of each. To avoid harming dealers and undermining its business, Harley said it will swallow the cost.""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden.""The company noted that ramping up production in international plants will require incremental investment and take nine to 18 months.The EU is Harley's most important market outside of the U.S., accounting for 40,000 sales in 2017. The company didn't note how U.S. workers would be affected but plans to detail financial implications as well as ways to mitigate the impact of retaliatory EU tariffs during the company's second-quarter earnings conference call on July 24.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Dow Jones Futures Fall As U.S. Plans China Tech Curbs: These 5 Top Stocks Are Near Buy PointsIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisThree Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals; China Plays Keep TumblingStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

625,KEY,"Recent days in the global Trump trade war have seen President Donald Trump go to bat to save Chinese tech jobs, while Harley-Davidson (HOG) shifts some production out of the U.S.The cognitive dissonance doesn't end there. Trump has lashed out at Canada for its high tariffs on dairy products. That's despite American dairy farmers pleading with Trump to lift steel tariffs on Mexico, or else Mexicans will cut U.S. cheese out of their diets. Daimler (DDAIF) warned that Chinese tariffs will sap demand for its Alabama-made SUVs, while Trump threatened to hit imported German luxury cars with a 20% tax.The Trump trade war is full of contradictions that are partly a function of fighting on so many fronts. The end result looks likely to undermine U.S. interests, U.S. companies and U.S. jobs, while playing into the hands of America's top trade adversary: China.Trump wants to bend the rules of trade to get foreign manufacturers to produce goods for Americans in the U.S., attacking American companies for deciding to set up shop overseas to meet local demand. Yet Trump is shooting himself in the foot. Retaliatory tariffs by U.S. trading partners and Trump's own tariffs on steel and aluminum are raising the cost of doing business here.Trump accused Harley-Davidson of waving the ""white flag"" after the motorcycle maker said Europe's extra 25% tariff on American-made Harleys — in retaliation for Trump's tariffs — would add about $2,200 to the cost of each motorcycle.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump argued that U.S. companies that stay strong will be rewarded when trading partners like the EU scrap their tariffs, including a 6% duty on Harleys. But companies have no reason to think Trump's strategy will work. While German carmakers are willing to give up a 10% tariff on imports, they're demanding that Trump cancel a decades-old 25% U.S. tax on imported SUVs and pickup trucks.Even when the U.S. could take the principled high ground, Trump is alienating U.S. allies and acting as if economic might makes right.Trump wasn't wrong in calling out Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the country's dairy tariffs of 270%, yet the U.S. has its own sacred cows, so to speak. Overall, Canada has among the lowest tariffs in the world, even slightly lower than the U.S., according to the World Bank.Meanwhile, Trump's steel tariffs on Canada are so out of bounds that even the United Steelworkers union has called for Trump to drop the tariffs. Canada is the biggest steel exporter to the U.S., shipping 5.8 million metric tons in 2017. Yet, it's also the largest export market for U.S. steelmakers, importing 4.8 million metric tons. Trump tariffs ignore the latter.Harley-Davidson is hardly the only U.S. company mulling layoffs as collateral damage from the Trump trade war. Mid-Continent Nail of Missouri has reportedly laid off 60 workers and could cut hundreds more if it can't get an exemption from Trump steel tariffs that make its wares uncompetitive.Some 20,000 companies have sought exclusions. But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that fewer than 100 had been processed, with 42 accepted and 56 denied. Sixteen jobs could be lost for every steel and aluminum job added thanks to tariffs, a study by the Trade Partnerships Worldwide consultancy estimated.The latest survey of regional manufacturers by the Kansas City Fed found plenty of criticism of the Trump trade war. Statements from business owners included this: ""Bracing for the worst concerning China tariffs. We will move the last of manufacturing offshore. Loss of business due to tariffs will have a larger impact than interest rates.""Trump's tariffs on Chinese high-tech-related imports, due to take effect starting July 6, would make U.S. multinationals less competitive.How? Rather than target mostly finished goods that U.S. consumers buy from Chinese companies, the Trump tariffs hit so-called intermediate goods. U.S. companies import them from China to incorporate in finished U.S. products, which then become pricier vs. rivals.""That the tariffs fail to hurt Chinese firms directly should not be a surprise,"" wrote Peterson Institute researchers Mary Lovely and Yang Liang.President Xi Jinping's Made In China 2025 agenda aims to close the technological gap and end the dependence on advanced tech from non-Chinese companies. But that's an aspiration, the researchers noted, while current Chinese tech still lags that of the U.S. and others.""It is impossible to hit tomorrow's exports with today's tariffs.""The Semiconductor Industry Association says much the same thing: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""The chief Trump trade war target is China, which has a $375 billion trade surplus with the U.S., limits market access and systematically conspires to gain access to the intellectual property of U.S. firms.The U.S. could try to isolate Beijing by creating a broad united front to keep China honest or make it pay a price. This is what President Obama had in mind with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.But four days into his term, Trump scrapped that 12-nation trade deal, which included intellectual property protections. This spring he briefly toyed with rejoining the TPP.Instead of major U.S. trading partners uniting against China, the U.S. is drawing fire from all sides for Trump tariffs. China is widely seen as the prime culprit in global steel overcapacity that is at the root of Trump's 25% steel tariff. Yet China has been a minor steel exporter to the U.S., so Trump has picked a fight with Japan, the EU, Mexico and Canada.If the biggest trade threat to the U.S. is China and its world-dominating tech ambitions, why is Trump out to save 70,000 jobs at Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE?Trump decided last month to overturn Commerce Department sanctions against ZTE that banned key U.S. component suppliers from doing business with the firm, forcing it to cease operations.This week, Trump dropped a plan for emergency investment and export rules, including a 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology. Instead, Trump backed legislation in Congress to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.Trump could have gone as far as banning chip equipment sales to Chinese firms, Moody's said this week. That would have been a bitter pill for Xi and could have derailed trade talks.Trump appears to view America's big trade deficit as low-hanging fruit for an easy trade-war win. He largely declared victory a month ago, when China agreed to boost U.S. purchases by $70 billion. Trump touted the emerging deal as a big win for American farmers. The loser wouldn't be China, but other countries that supply it.That may explain why the Trump trade war appears to be more diplomatic with China than with traditional U.S. allies.With no allies to join in pressuring China to change its state-subsidized technology strategy, Trump seems to be settling for low-hanging fruit. He appears to be taking a softer line on export controls, pushing the seemingly inevitable technological cold war with China down the road.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Don't Panic: Here's Why Trump's China Trade War Won't HappenDow Jones Futures Try To Rally: This Key Tech Sector Flashes Big WarningIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

626,KEY,"American Airlines (AAL) on Wednesday cut its second-quarter unit revenue outlook on weaker domestic pricing power on airfares. The announcement appeared to surprise Wall Street, denting airline stocks and leaving analysts searching for reasons after rising fuel costs and strong demand have given airlines more leeway to charge passengers more to fly.One analyst, in wondering about reasons for the cut, said ""most fingers are being pointed at"" competition from Southwest (LUV). Others said American's less upbeat view on unit revenue was unusual because many airlines had suggested the worst fare discounting was behind them.American Airlines said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to increase around 1%-3%, lower than an earlier outlook for a 1.5%-3.5% gain. The carrier said the cut was due to ""lower than anticipated domestic yields."" Yields measure how much money an airline can get out of passengers when they book flights.Shares of American tumbled 8% to close at 35.96 on the stock market today. The carrier's stock has been at lows not seen before the 2016 election. Airline stocks this year have suffered due to higher jet-fuel costs and President Trump's trade-related provocations.Other airline stocks retreated as well. Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports second-quarter earnings on Thursday, slipped 1.5%. United Airlines (UAL) lost 3.4%. Southwest fell 0.9%, touching its 50-day line.When fuel costs rise, investors prefer that airlines push fare costs higher. In a solid demand environment, higher fares usually translate into higher unit revenue. Unit revenue gauges how efficiently an airline operates by measuring sales in relation to an airline's overall flight coverage.""In an environment with higher fuel prices and what by all accounts seems to be very strong demand, it's curious that domestic yields would be weaker than expected,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.""We have some theories but no concrete explanation. It seems like most fingers are being pointed at American's neighbor,"" he added, referring to Southwest.American on Wednesday also said it would lose $35 million in pretax income as a result of computer-system problems at PSA Airlines, a regional airline the carrier owns, that forced the cancellation of some 3,000 flights last month. But it said costs at non-fuel units would only be up 2.5%. That's less than the 3.5% bump expected earlier, due partly to lower-than-expected maintenance costs.The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would impose tariffs on an extra $200 billion in Chinese products. U.S. tariffs targeting $34 billion worth of Chinese products took hold on Friday. Some analysts worry that a full-blown trade war could force companies to cut spending. That spending pullback, in turn, could crimp corporate travel.As airlines prepare to report second-quarter earnings this month, Wall Street will be focused on how carriers can counterbalance rising fuel prices. American CEO Doug Parker said last month that customers could face rising airfare costs, as higher fuel expenses prompt carriers to pull back on the flights they offer. However, he said such a scenario was unlikely in the near term.Southwest, which reported June traffic results on Tuesday, has already pared back its full-year flight capacity.

628,KEY,"It's tough not to wonder what you might have left on the table when taking profits in that hot stock. But it's better to speculate after the fact, rather than to risk having all of those gains cycle into a loss.Of course, investors hope their latest purchase will double, triple or more in price. And some will, but such big winners are often few and far between.Most stocks will pause to take a breather once they've run up about 20%. So a prudent rule of thumb is to take profits when you're up 20% to 25% on most of your stocks. Even if you don't sell the entire position, it doesn't hurt to lock in some gains.You can then use those winnings to open a position in another stock on your watch list. But what if you're convinced the stock you own isn't ready to slow down?That's why a special hold rule exists. True leaders can sometimes score even bigger gains during a short period. So if a leading stock you own soars 20% or more in less than three weeks from a breakout or a rebound off the 10-week moving average, that warrants holding for eight weeks.When the hold period expires, evaluate the stock to decide if you should sell it or hang on to it for even longer.Whatever you do, don't take what's called a round trip. That's when a stock gives up everything it gained from the breakout.Let's say stock XYZ, which boasts sound fundamentals across the board, breaks out past a 20.10 cup-base buy point in heavy trade and rises as much as 20% to 24.12 over the next month. You know you should lock in some gains, but think the stock may have more legs, so you stay put.Now XYZ starts to slip. Soon your gain has been whittled down to 18%, then 16%, and so forth. But volume has been light, so you keep holding as the stock nears its 50-day moving average. Then it suddenly slices the key support line and falls below the buy point. You've just taken a full round trip — and it was anything but relaxing.RetailMeNot, which formerly had the ticker symbol ""SALE,"" came public with much fanfare on July 19, 2013, and closed 32% above its 21 offering price the first day. From there it rallied as much as 43% over the next two months before pausing to start its first base.The stock formed a cup-shape base with a 35% correction, on the deep end, but still within normal range. It broke out past a 39.60 buy point the week ended Feb. 14, 2014, in heavy volume (1). RetailMeNot extended its gains, soaring as much as 23% over the next two weeks (2). Such a strong advance normally triggers the eight-week hold rule.But on Feb. 28, 2014, the stock fell 11% in heavy trade, paring its post-breakout gain to 5%. Even though the hold rule was in place, that was an alarming drop. The next week, shares had dipped more than two points below the original 39.60 entry before finding support at the 10-week moving average (3).And by March 11, it closed 17 cents below the buy point (4). Had investors not gotten out by then, they would have suffered a round trip.While the market was in the thick of a bull run, RetailMeNot's fundamentals weren't pristine. Earnings fell 9% and 15% in Q2 and Q3 2013 before rebounding with a 73% gain in the fourth quarter. After-tax profit margins also narrowed during most of those quarterly periods.Then RetailMeNot reported five quarters in a row of falling profits.By February 2016, the stock traded as low as 5.52 a share before getting acquired by Harland Clarke Holdings in May 2017 at $11.60 a share.Editor's Note: A version of this column originally was published in the Sept. 16, 2014, edition of IBD.

629,KEY,"Dow Jones futures fell early Monday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures as Asian markets and crude futures retreated. Five notable chip stocks are near buy points: Micron Technology (MU), Texas Instruments (TXN), Broadcom (AVGO), ASML (ASML) and Entegris (ENTG). Micron Technology reports earnings on Wednesday.Micron stock also is the highest rated, with a 98 Composite Rating. Entegris has a 94 Composite Rating, Texas Instruments a 92 CR and ASML a 90 CR. Broadcom stock, which struggled for months amid a failed bid for Qualcomm (QCOM) and weak smartphone demand, has a lowly so-so 69 CR.Chip stocks tend to be a key component of a stock market rally, especially when the Nasdaq composite leads. Some chipmakers have broken out, including Intel (INTC). But in recent weeks retail, software and FANG stocks have led, with software and Chinese livestreaming IPOs soaring.Dow Jones futures slid 0.75% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.8% below fair value. Asian markets generally closed lower in the wake of an escalating U.S.-China trade war. European bourses also retreated. U.S. crude futures sank below $65 a barrel.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseKeep in mind that stock market futures often don't translate into how the Dow Jones and other major averages trade in the next regular session.Last week the Nasdaq composite rose 1.3%, the S&P 500 index was flat and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.9%. All the major averages fell modestly Friday as the U.S. and China announced tariffs on each other, with the risk of further escalation.Micron Technology is in a cup base with a high handle buy point of 64.76. Shares soared in May, with the memory chip specialist announcing strong earnings guidance early on May 21 and then a big buyback after the close that day. Shares hit an 18-year high, but failed to close above an entry. Micron stock has pulled back, forming a handle and closing Friday 58.23.Micron fell 0.8% before the open in Monday's stock market trading.Micron is expected to report a 93% EPS gain to $3.12 as sales pop 39% to $7.75 billion for fiscal Q2. The company has benefited from strong demand and high prices for memory chips. Some analysts question if those prices can be sustained, so the results and guidance will closely watched.Texas Instruments stock has been consolidating since late January. The stock has formed an 118.58 handle. The handle isn't visible on a weekly chart, which isn't ideal. But the handle shows up clearly on a daily. It's 7 days long so far with the pullback moderate but clear.Broadcom is working on a 273.95 double-bottom base. The wireless chipmaker has rallied since early May, closing Friday at 270.23. The stock hit resistance around this area a couple of times earlier this year.Broadcom stock has been consolidating since late November. Shares came under pressure as the chipmaker made a big bid for fellow wireless chipmaker Qualcomm. Even after President Trump blocked a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal on national security grounds, the stock continued to struggle as Broadcom warned of weak smartphone demand. That was seen as a sign of weak Apple (AAPL) iPhone X demand.ASML stock topped a 216.10 flat-base buy point on Thursday, but with a modest 1% gain and volume that was 10% below normal. You'd like to a stock truly break out, with a strong price and volume that's at least 40%-50% above normal. Shares dipped to 214.82 on Friday.ASML fell 2.2% before the open.Entegris stock crossed a 38.34 buy point several times, closing above that entry last Tuesday.

636,KEY,"The Federal Reserve on Thursday restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and shot down the capital plan of a Deutsche Bank (DB) U.S. subsidiary in its second round of stress tests. But the central bank largely cleared the big banks to deliver payouts to shareholders. Bank stocks largely rose for much of the day, but closed mixed as the major market indexes slashed gains.The Fed, in ""conditionally"" passing Morgan and Goldman in the tests, said the banks would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years, which will allow them to build capital over the next year.""The central bank said those banks' capital ratios, under the plans they originally submitted and with a one-time reduction resulting from tax reform, fell below the Fed's required levels in the test.The second round of the tests — the one Wall Street cares more about — evaluates banks' dividend and buyback plans, and the strength of their risk management practices and other internal controls. Many of the banks that passed the second test, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, dialed up their shareholder returns.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a statement.All the banks tested passed the first round of the tests last week, although Morgan and Goldman came close to falling short on a key leverage ratio. Still, passing the annual industry health checkup, implemented after the financial crisis a decade ago, has become easier for the big banks, even as the Fed each year tries to add harsher, or at least different, ingredients to the mix.But even amid a surging economy and loosening regulations, bank stocks have wilted over the last few months on concerns over the economy longer-term.After the Fed expressed reservations, Morgan Stanley said it would boost its quarterly dividend to 30 cents per share, up from 25 cents, and buy back up to $4.7 billion in common stock. Morgan Stanley stock rose Friday but remained near six-month lows.Goldman said that its capital plan included a boost in its dividend to 85 cents per share, up from 80 cents. The bank also said its capital plan allowed up to $5 billion in stock buybacks. Goldman rose modestly and was near nine-month lows.Goldman said the Fed did not object to its capital plan, ""conditioned upon the firm returning not more than $6.3 billion of capital beginning in the third quarter of 2018 and ending in the second quarter of 2019.""The Fed said it objected to the capital plan from the Deutsche Bank subsidiary, DB USA Corp., citing ""material weaknesses in the firm's data capabilities and controls supporting its capital planning process, as well as weaknesses in its approaches and assumptions used to forecast revenues and losses under stress.""The Fed also gave State Street Corp. (STT) a conditional pass. The central bank said its evaluation revealed ""counterparty exposures that produced large losses.""""The firm will be required to take certain steps regarding the management and analysis of its counterparty exposures under stress,"" the Fed added.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said it intends to raise its quarterly common stock dividend to 80 cents a share, up from 56 cents a share, effective in Q3. The bank also OK'd share buybacks of up to $20.7 billion between July 1 and June 30, 2019.Citigroup (C), meanwhile, announced an increase in its dividend to 45 cents a share, up from 32 cents. It also announced a buyback program of up to $17.6 billion during the four quarters starting in the third quarter.Bank of America (BAC) said its board plans to raise its dividend by 25% to 15 cents a share, starting in Q3. BofA said it had also been cleared to buy back roughly $20.6 billion in common stock.JPMorgan Chase bumped retreated 0.7% in the stock market today, reversing from solid gains intraday. Bank of America retreated 1.6%. Citigroup picked up 0.1%. Goldman Sachs lost 1.3% while Morgan Stanley slipped 1.8%.In the first round of bank stress tests, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley nearly missed clearing the minimum for what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio. The ratio measures how much capital a bank needs in relation to its assets.Morgan Stanley, in a statement last week, said those results ""may not be indicative of the capital distributions that we will be permitted to make"" after the release of the second round of results. Goldman said essentially the same thing, with a statement that it expected to discuss the first-round test results with the Fed.Banks can resubmit their payout plans if the Fed's results are too pessimistic for a bank's liking.""Despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year's test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession,"" Vice Chairman Randal K. Quarles said in a statement last Thursday.Under the bleakest economic scenario, the Fed last week concluded that the 35 banks subject to the tests would lose $578 billion total. The so-called ""severely adverse"" scenario, the harshest one laid out by the Fed each year, included a global recession and a six percentage-point rise in unemployment to 10%.The source of bank stocks' woes has been the tightening Treasury yield curve. The curve, which measures the difference between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, has narrowed sharply over the past several months to the flattest in years. The spread has narrowed further in the last few weeks.Rates on longer end of the curve tend to rise when expectations for the economy are brighter. The idea is that when the economy grows, prices rise, so investors demand a higher return on government debt to make up for the declining purchasing power of the dollar over that time. Borrowers are willing to pay up, because they expect a higher rate of return.But longer-term rates have waned. Meanwhile, the short end of the curve has risen, thanks to the Fed's recent hikes on overnight rates. That sluggish long-term yield reflects concerns that the Fed will raise rates too aggressively as the Trump tax cuts and fiscal stimulus boost economic growth in 2018 but then wear offBanks tend to borrow money according to short-term rates, while lending out money according to longer-term rates. The narrowing gap between short-term and long-term bond yields thus threatens to crimp banks' profits.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Blame The Fed For Dow, S&P Struggles, Not Just Trump Trade WarsThe Big Squeeze: New Risks For Fed Interest Rates, Recession And Yield CurveBanking Industry's Zelle Seen Outgrowing Square Cash, PayPal's VenmoBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis

637,KEY,"President Trump's China trade war, the biggest immediate threat to the stock market, may be off again, but the coast doesn't look clear. If you're looking for reasons why Wednesday's rally failed, the Fed is a good place to start. The clearest sign that the Fed is helping to hold back the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 from scaling new heights is the flattening of the yield curve since the last Fed meeting.XOn Wednesday, the gap between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields shrank to as little as 32 basis points, the narrowest since the yield curve inverted in 2007, meaning short-term yields exceeded long-term yields. The two-year yield, at 2.51%, isn't too far off its 10-year high of 2.6% hit last month. But the 10-year yield has slid from a recent peak of 3.13% all the way to 2.83%.The yield curve has gotten a lot flatter since the Fed meeting two weeks ago, with the gap between two-year and 10-year yields narrowing 12 basis points (from 44 basis points) on June 11. The next day, Fed policymaker projections indicated an expectation of two more quarter-point rate hikes this year, for a total of four in 2018, then three more in 2019.The flatter yield curve reflects investors curbing their expectations about the strength and durability of the nascent Trump boom, and tighter Fed policy is a prime reason.The flatter yield curve is more than a signal. Higher short-term borrowing costs courtesy of the Fed are putting upward pressure on the dollar, weighing on the profits of U.S. multinationals and squeezing bank lending margins. Since climbing back to its 50-day moving average on June 11, Bank of America (BAC) has fallen in 9 of 12 sessions as the yield curve has flattened. Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has fallen in 10 of the past 12 sessions, losing about 6% of its value.Tighter Fed policy, higher short-term rates and a stronger dollar also tend to tighten financial conditions in emerging markets, where companies often borrow in dollars, not their home currencies.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Fed is tightening policy on two tracks, both hiking rates and gradually reversing its quantitative easing asset purchases made to aid the recovery after the financial crisis.The Fed is preaching patience even as core inflation approaches its 2% target, but patience is in the eye of the bond holder, and right now markets seem to think that monetary policymakers are too hawkish.For now, the economy is zipping along and monetary policy, which operates with a lag, isn't much of an impediment. But it is still a risk to the value of financial assets. The problem is that a policy designed to tighten just enough to gently rein in an economy goosed by tax cuts and federal spending hikes could become much too tight by the second half of 2019, as fiscal stimulus levels out.""Once the impact of the fiscal stimulus fades, we expect economic growth in the U.S. to slow perceptibly,"" Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank, wrote recently. ""Accordingly, we anticipate that after the four rate hikes in 2018, the Fed will only raise its target rate one more time in 2019, before the growth slowdown puts an end to the central bank's policy normalization efforts.""If that's right, then the Fed's hawkish plan being priced into markets is holding short-term rates too high, unnecessarily dampening the growth outlook.Meanwhile, there are other clouds on the horizon that are dampening the global growth outlook. Italian bond yields have surged as Italy's new coalition government threatens to blow up its already-unsustainable debt trajectory. Meanwhile, China is also showing signs of slowing.""Aside from an escalation in trade tensions, there are several factors that are now combining to darken the outlook for the world economy cyclically and structurally,"" Nomura chief U.S. economist Lewis Alexander wrote in a Wednesday note.

638,KEY,"MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) is flexing its muscles. After topping 69% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar.com last year with a 26.29% return, the $3.1 billion portfolio is outpacing 86% of its peers with a 15.33% gain this year going into June 21.It's also topping the S&P 500's modest 4.46% advance. The fund's strong performance this year has been fueled by holdings that include such leading growth stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Netflix (NFLX), Lululemon Athletica (LULU), TransUnion (TRU) and Five Below (FIVE).Gains this year by those stocks range from 30% by TransUnion to 104% by Netflix and 118% by Abiomed.Relative performance has ramped up for this growth fund this year as many holdings have posted solid financial results. ""The first quarter was particularly strong for us with many stocks reporting good earnings and an unusually low number of misses (in comparison to analysts' forecasts),"" co-manager Paul Gordon said.Solid stock picking has been another factor. The market tide is no longer rising, lifting all boats. ""Volatility in markets has picked up and correlations have dropped,"" Gordon said. ""There is more separation between winners and losers.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmid tighter monetary conditions, investors have gravitated mainly into stocks posting the most attractive earnings gains, he adds.In addition, Gordon and his colleagues Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel aim to control risk. ""We construct the portfolio so no single sector, industry or security will be more than 500 or 600 basis points over or under our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Growth Index,"" Gordon said.The growth fund began its current stake in Abiomed in Q1. ""(It's) key driver is a heart pump called Impella, which is focused on an unserved part of the heart disease market,"" Gordon said. ""It has been extremely successful because it improves patient outcomes — fewer deaths, fewer re-hospitalizations — and lowers cost to the system.""Abiomed is only 10% penetrated in what they call their total addressable market, Gordon says. ""But that TAM could increase as they expand into other indications in the future,"" he added.Netflix's earnings per shares grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past six quarters. ""With 125 million paying subscriber base, there's a significant long-term runway for that number to go higher, based on the number of people in the world paying for TV and connected to the internet,"" Gordon said.Also, Netflix share price — which set all-time highs above 400 in June — got a boost when the company demonstrated pricing power in a series of price hikes. ""What the market really liked was that there was no significant change in the number of people who unplugged because of price increases,"" Gordon said.IBD'S TAKE: Keep your eye on Netflix by checking in to IBD's online page devoted to news and analysis focused on the content provider.Athletic apparel maker Lululemon's quarterly EPS growth has accelerated, growing 3%, 19%, 33% and 72% the past four stanzas. Share price is up more than 60% so far this year. Are there that many people taking up yoga? Or is the stock's jump due to an increasing number of people who want to wear stylist exercise garb even when they are nowhere near a yoga studio? Or is it a combination of the two?The stock's uptrend is a recovery from the slide that occurred from mid-2016 to mid-2017. Gordon attributes it to getting past quality and assortment problems that weighed on company performance.""After several years of operational issues that distracted the company, they've come out strong on the innovation side, both in women's and men's apparel,"" Gordon said.The growth fund began to buy TransUnion in November after deciding to exit Equifax (EFX) in the wake of its data breach scandal. ""We think there is a need for their (credit reporting) product,"" Gordon said. ""We think the Equifax issues were isolated and that it's possible TransUnion could gain market share as a result.""The MFS team likes TransUnion in its own right. ""We believe TransUnion could have above-industry growth from innovation in its core credit (business) that will make credit decisions more accurate and thereby drive pricing,"" Gordon said.He also says the company should benefit from further penetration into the health care, auto and insurance markets, and from greater exposure to emerging markets.Five Below's price discounts and focus on a teen market help insulate it from the problems dogging many brick-and-mortar retailers. ""They are more isolated from the Amazon (AMZN) threat,"" Gordon said. ""Like other dollar-store or off-price concepts, they offer a treasure hunt to their younger skewed demographic. It also has one of the longest runways for store growth in all of retail.""The chain now operates more than 400 stores, ""and long-term they believe they could operate over 2,000,"" Gordon said. ""It will take longer than five years at their current rate of growth.""The chain benefited last year from strong sales of Fidget Spinners. Five Below posted strong comparable sales in its latest quarter, surprising investors who expected a letdown after the Fidget Spinner fad.

639,KEY,"Economists differ on how much blame the Smoot-Hawley tariffs deserve for the Great Depression. They also disagree on how much credit President Franklin Roosevelt deserves for the Reciprocal Tariff Act, which put the U.S. on a path to lower tariffs.But the stock market had no trouble choosing sides.A look back at two pivotal bills — the Smoot-Hawley Act and the Reciprocal Tariff Act — and the Dow's reaction, might serve as a cautionary tale for President Trump.Put simply, the stock market doesn't like tariffs, and if Trump pushes it too far, he could sink the stock market.Let's look at key news events surrounding the protectionist Smoot-Hawley bill that President Hoover signed in 1930 and the more free-trade oriented Reciprocal Tariff bill that FDR signed in 1934.The circumstances listed here do not prove causation. That's for economists and historians to settle. Stock analysts are interested in only one thing: How did the market react?Here's the evidence:May 28, 1929: House passes Smoot-Hawley legislation, (1) but it's not clear that it will become law.Oct. 21, 1929: Senate rejects move to limit tariffs to agriculture.Oct. 28, 1929: A delegation of senators urges Hoover to push through the tariffs. Hoover agrees.Oct. 29, 1929: Stock market crashes (2).March 24, 1930: Senate passes Smoot-Hawley bill.May 4, 1930: 1,028 economists warn Hoover against tariffs.June 17, 1930: Hoover ignores economists and signs Smoot-Hawley (3).The economy skids. GDP drops 8.5% in 1930, 6.4% in 1931 and 12.9% in 1932.July 8, 1932: With Hoover's policies failing, the Tariff Commission trims 18 tariffs.Sept. 19, 1932: Presidential candidate FDR calls tariffs ""the road to ruin.""March 4, 1933: FDR becomes president (4).June 12, 1934: President Roosevelt signs the Reciprocal Tariff Act to cut tariffs (5).The economy rebounds: GDP grows 10.8% in 1934, 8.9% in 1935 and 12.9% in 1936.What can an investor conclude from this? Expectations surrounding Smoot-Hawley affected the market. And the run-up to the Reciprocal Trade Act triggered a rally.Circumstances differ today. The U.S. economy is growing. Yet, other things are similar. In 1930, 1,028 economists warned Hoover in a letter. On May 3 of this year, 1,140 economists echoed history when they warned Trump not to take the tariff path.There's no sign the recent letter had any more effect on Trump than it did on Hoover.Trump still has time to correct the mistake. If he doesn't, the stock market could be headed for trouble.OTHER ARTICLES:Live With Purpose And Learn From The Best24 Quotes From The SuccessfulThe Artist Behind The MG Roadster

Earlier, the stock was down as much as 14.4%.

An IBD article on June 18 focused on the technology, which removes an entire ""village"" of supportive cellular elements to regrow full-thickness skin for burn victims and to lessen the visibility of scars.For the article, IBD asked to interview an expert familiar with the technology. A spokesperson for the company connected IBD with Dr. Mark Granick, a professor and chief of plastic surgery at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.Both the company and Granick failed to disclose that Granick is a paid member of PolarityTE's clinical board of advisors. That fact is listed on PolarityTE's website, but isn't listed on Granick's public profile with the medical school.A spokesperson for the company told IBD in a follow-up email that advisory boards are normal for biotech and medtech companies.""These are small companies that seek input from those in research of clinical practice,"" the spokesperson said. ""I know that we didn't present Granick as someone other than (one) of the first users of the product who can talk about his experiences.""The article has since been removed from IBD's Investors.com website.Citron describes itself as a stock commentary website.

646,KEY,"Diligent stock chart analysis is key to learning how to invest in growth stocks successfully. Those who take the time to learn the ascending base, one of the rarer patterns, will have a better chance of pinpointing new buy points and achieving bigger returns.If identified properly, this base can lead to big gains. While the definition of an ascending base sounds relatively straightforward — three pullbacks amid a series of higher price highs and higher price lows — context matters a great deal.Leading stocks create ascending bases during periods of market weakness. The stock continually hits a new high, but is dragged down by the general market.Ascending bases are typically nine to 16 weeks in duration, starting with the first week down within the first pullback. In ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" IBD founder William J. O'Neil notes that the depth of each pullback ranges from 10%-20%. The MarketSmith Pattern Recognition algorithm scans for three pullbacks that correct between 6% and 25% to help compensate for a stock's individual volatility.Small-cap stocks tend to trade with more volatility than large-cap stocks, but both can form these bullish base formations.OpenTable traded under the ticker symbol OPEN before it was acquired by Priceline Group — now Booking Holdings (BKNG) — in 2014 for $2.6 billion.In the first pullback, the online restaurant-reservation service dropped 17% from May 18 to June 8 (1). The next pullback was 12.4% deep, from June 18 to July 1 (2). Finally, the last pullback showed milder action, as the stock slid just over 9% from July 13 to 16 (3).Check out the relative strength line — inked in blue on every IBD daily and weekly chart. It makes a new high during two of the three pullbacks, indicating that the stock is ready to become a market leader, but an uncooperative general market is holding it back.Shares broke out on July 26 when it barely peeked above the 46.66 buy point. But the stock wasn't ready at that point to advance.Finally, on Aug. 4, the stock surged back above the buy point with a 217% increase in volume (4). Almost four weeks later, on Sept. 1, the general market would follow through to the upside, kicking off a solid uptrend. From there, the stock rose more than 150%. Shares peaked on April 25, 2011, at 118.66.But as quickly as the stock advanced, it fell even faster. On May 4, the stock crashed through its 50-day moving average in huge volume — a potential sell signal.

648,KEY,"Biotech funds tacked on $76 million this week, adding to more than $500 million in net inflows over the past two weeks — a phenomenon biotech stocks haven't seen in nine months.But activity within exchange-traded funds lent a heavy helping hand. Outside ETFs, the flow of biotech funds was negative, Raymond James analyst Laura Chico said. Still, overall biotech net assets increased 0.11% as ""all equities"" saw net outflows representing 0.13% in total assets.Chico questioned whether three weeks could make a trend. The once red-hot biotech group stood eighth out of 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily just 13 weeks ago. It slid to the 32nd slot four weeks ago and today it's ranked No. 17.""Staying in the black for yet another week,"" Chico said in a note.

The data represent 101 healthcare and biotech funds with $73 billion in collective assets.""As we see it, this is a key dynamic to monitor as periods of net inflows historically correspond with biotech outperformance while periods of net outflows correspond with sector underperformance,"" he said in a report.Amid the biotech stocks' performance, all equities saw outflows for the second week running, he said. This marks the third week of outflows across all equities out of the past nine weeks.But year to date, biotech funds remain negative with net outflows at about $2 billion, Raymond James' Chico said. Quarter to date, biotech funds have seen about $34 million in net inflows.""The second quarter historically has been a more variable period for biotech fund flows with $2 billion in net outflows in 2016 and $1.3 billion in net inflows in 2017,"" she said.Activity within biotech ETFs didn't change this week. Considering the breadth of ETF activity in the biotech group, this is ""a key metric to watch,"" Chico said.The ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (BIB) climbed 1.9% this week. It's consolidating with an entry point at 69.72. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) rose 1%, moving closer to a buy point at 119.40. Shares of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) were flat this week.On the stock market today, biotech stocks tracked by IBD were close to flat. Shares within three major biotech ETFs dipped less than 1%.Excluding the impact of ETFs, biotech funds have seen just four weeks of inflows since the start of 2018. None of those weeks were in the second quarter, Chico said.""We continue to see biotech sector being influenced by several drivers: data readouts, commercial execution, (mergers and acquisitions) potential and capital market accessibility,"" she said.

658,KEY,"SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft (MSFT) believes 2018 will be the year when blockchain finally goes mainstream.XMark Russinovich, chief technology officer for the software giant's Azure cloud platform, said a whole range of industries are on the cusp of introducing the electronic ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.""People have been saying for the last couple of years it will be the year of production blockchain for enterprises, and I think this year we're actually starting to see them go into production,"" he told IBD Thursday at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto.Blockchain stores information chronologically in ""blocks"" to allow for the efficient and nearly instantaneous processing and transfer of data. According to Russinovich, just about every enterprise will be using it in one way or another in the years to come.""I think this is the beginning of the point where now these technologies are becoming mainstream enough, people understand it enough, that they can begin to deploy it,"" he said. ""I expect this to grow pretty rapidly in the next couple of years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe sees the key benefits for businesses as being the reduction in the chance of fraud (as the technology is extremely difficult to hack), the reduction of waste and the elimination of middlemen.The executive said his firm has been working with ""dozens of companies""to develop usable applications for blockchain, including Wall Street giants such as Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). The company has now rolled out tools to simplify the process of deploying the technology for customers.And he highlighted two companies that have been making great strides in blockchain: industrial conglomerate 3M (MMM) and Australian travel firm Webjet.""3M are doing it to track the provenance of pharmaceuticals, to make sure that when a customer gets it they can verify it came from a reputable source. There's so much fraud in the pharmaceutical industry,"" Russinovich said during a speech at the Yahoo Finance event.Blockchain offered Webjet a way to streamline a typically cumbersome process. The firm found that during a single transaction, like a hotel room going to an end user, five smaller transactions are involved. And that is only the beginning of the problems.""They found that roughly 1 in 10 of those transactions require some kind of manual intervention because of a problem along the way. In roughly 1 in 25, someone on that chain doesn't get paid. So there's a lot of loss, and there is also a lot of fraud,"" Russinovich said. ""They've turned to operationalizing blockchain on top of an Ethereum platform on Azure and created a network called Reschain. It's a reservation blockchain network that they say reduces, for their internal properties, the level of intervention by over 90%.""Microsoft has two key products for the deployment of blockchain at the enterprise level. The first is the Workbench platform, which provides an interface that allows business users to construct solutions that suit their needs. It provides prebuilt networks and infrastructure.The second product is the Coco Framework, which allows companies to use blockchain while keeping their data private. This is important, as it allows companies to retain the confidentiality of their dealings with various suppliers and customers.Russinovich believes Microsoft is leading the way on blockchain over cloud space rivals such as Amazon.com (AMZN), and he said customers have provided encouraging feedback on their offerings.""Response has been great. It's been really resonating because this is exactly what they have been looking for,"" he said. ""It's Software-as-a-Service basically.

659,KEY,"Civil Society: When not worrying that its increasingly hostile anti-Trump antics might backfire on Democrats, the left is busy blaming President Trump's own incivility for the ferocity of their attacks. But this is exactly how the left treats all conservatives, rough-hewn or not.After a week in which a celebrity called for the abduction of the president's young son, a restaurant kicked out Trump's spokesman, and a mob harassed the Homeland Security secretary, Democrats are starting to wonder if their  ""resistance"" is getting out of hand — while refusing to take any blame for it.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi managed to perfectly encapsulate this when she said ""Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable.""The blame-Trump-first meme has been catching on fast.Writing in the Washington Post, Paul Waldman complains about having ""to hear, in the era of Trump, that liberals are the ones being 'uncivil'…. You've got to be kidding me.""CNN's Byron Wolf says today's lack of civility ""should surprise exactly no one in a time when the president uses the imagery of invaders and infestation to describe immigrants.""Writing in USA Today, Jason Sattler argues that we should ""stop defending decorum and do something about Donald Trump,"" who, Sattler says, is ""running a propaganda campaign against immigrants that incites comparisons to Hitler's early attacks on Jews.""But the suggestion that things would be better and tempers cooler if Trump weren't so abrasive is utterly and completely false.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

They burned Bush and other administration officials in effigy countless times.Jonathan Chait wrote a 3,600-word word piece for the New Republic in 2003 on ""the case for Bush hatred."" In it, he admitted that ""I have friends who … describe his existence as a constant oppressive force in their daily psyche.""Nobel Peace Prize winner Betty Williams gave a speech at a women's peace conference in Dallas in 2007 declaring that ""right now, I could kill George Bush."" The audience laughed, and she won praise for her ""bravery.""Pollster Geoff Garin told The New York Times that Bush hatred was ""as strong as anything I've experienced in 25 years now of polling.""The winning film at a 2006 Toronto film festival was a movie — Death of a President — that realistically depicted Bush's assassination.The left regularly compared Bush to Hitler, just as they are now with Trump.Playwright Harold Pinter said that ""the Bush administration is the most dangerous force that has ever existed. It is more dangerous than Nazi Germany.""Harry Belafonte called Bush ""the greatest terrorist in the world.""Writing in Time magazine in 2003 — just two years after Bush took office — Charles Krauthammer (a trained psychiatrist) noted that ""Democrats are seized with a loathing for President Bush — a contempt and disdain giving way to a hatred that is near pathological."" He coined a phrase to describe it: ""Bush derangement syndrome.""What was the left's excuse back then for its gleeful indulgence in hatred and incivility toward friendly George Bush? Simple: They didn't like his policies.That's always been the left's response to politicians they don't agree with: Harass, attack, belittle, demean, threaten, scream … and repeat. Unlike Republicans, however, the left never gets called on its hate-mongering.Sure, Trump's barbed rhetoric and insults fan the flames of today's incivility. And like most people, we'd prefer that he adopt a more presidential tone.But even if Trump had the temperament of Mister Rogers, Trump derangement syndrome would be just as virulent and widespread as it is today.Not because of anything Trump has said or tweeted.

Pacira tumbled 13.9%, to 34.25.

Across the board, HTX-011 and a combination using it proved better at staving off pain than a standard painkiller called bupivacaine.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich argued that puts Pacira's painkiller, Exparel, at risk. Heron has said it will target hospitals and physicians already using Exparel. Later, it will go after those who use bupivacaine.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We continue to view HTX-011, if approved, as a huge competitive threat that is likely to significantly alter the future trajectory for Pacira's Exparel,"" he said in a report.He noted Exparel is difficult to administer. It must be mixed with standard bupivacaine and diluted to fill six separate syringes, all of which are injected multiple times in the case of knee replacement surgery. This requires no fewer than 50 needle sticks, he said.""By comparison, HTX-011 is instilled into the surgical site via a needle-free syringe,"" he said. ""As a result, it is unlikely to require special training to achieve optimal results.""Chief Executive Barry Quart sees reducing opioid use as key to preventing addiction. The firm plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration to approve HTX-011  in the back half of 2018.""With postoperative opioids serving as a gateway to addiction, there is a large unmet need for non-opioid pain alternatives,"" he said in a written statement. Heron now plans to submit its application for approval of HTX-011 in the U.S. in the second half of the year.Heron split knee replacement patients into four groups to test the effects of HTX-011 — alone, in combination with painkiller ropivacaine, bupivacaine by itself and a placebo.In knee replacement patients, the HTX-011 combination and HTX-011 alone resulted in pain reductions of 23% and 19%, respectively, 48 hours following surgery. The results were nearly double that of bupivacaine, which cut pain by 11% vs. a placebo.At 72 hours following surgery, the combination reduced pain by 22%. HTX-011 cut pain intensity by 19% compared to a placebo. Bupivacaine reduced pain by 11%.Using a more conservative assessment of pain, the combination and HTX-011 cut pain by a respective 16% and 12% at 48 hours vs. a placebo. Bupivacaine resulted in a 4% cut. At 72 hours, the combination and HTX-011 cut pain by 15% and 11%, respectively.Researchers tested HTX-011 as a nerve block — injecting it near key nerves — at three doses in breast augmentation. They tested bupivacaine and a placebo. Another study compared HTX-011 as an instillation — administered drop by drop — vs. a nerve block.A day after undergoing breast augmentation, patients experienced 22% reductions in pain intensity after receiving 400-milligram doses of HTX-011 as either a nerve block or by instillation. Bupivacaine as a nerve block resulted in an 8% reduction.With a more conservative measure of pain, HTX-011 by instillation cut pain by 24% a day after surgery. As a nerve block, it reduced pain intensity by 23%. A nerve block of bupivacaine resulted in a 12% reduction.HTX-011 as a 400-milligram instillation was effective in reducing opioid use by 33%. As a nerve block it reduced the need for opioids by 26% compared to a placebo.

Meanwhile, red-hot Chinese livestreaming IPOs iQiyi (IQ), Huya (HUYA) and Bilibili (BILI) extended big gains from the regular session.During the regular session, the Nasdaq composite rallied strongly to a new high, fueled by strong gains in FANG stocks such as Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB), with software and internet IPOs (including iQiyi, Huay and Bilibili) continuing to shine.

The IBD 50 stock also guided higher for the current Q3.Despite the seemingly positive news, Adobe stock fell 3.4% in late trade. That action offers three lessons for investors.Don't buy an extended stock: Adobe has run up 38.5% since its January breakout. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has consistently hit new highs. While Adobe could keep running, it would not be surprising to see Adobe pull back for a short period or consolidate over a period of weeks or months.Be cautious about buying a stock into earnings: Earnings reports are high risk, high reward. A strong report can send a stock soaring, but huge losses are also possible. Adobe's after-hours action is relatively muted give the stock's recent run. But investors should consider buying call options to minimize the downside risk while reaping any upside gains.Don't trust after-hours action: Whether it's Adobe stock or Dow Jones futures, overnight action doesn't always translate into trading in the next regular session. Perhaps Adobe will pull back modestly on Friday. But the stock could show a sharper loss or close with a gain.The Justice Department won't seek a stay to Tuesday night's federal court ruling. That would let the AT&T-Time Warner merger close, though the DOJ later could appeal the ruling itself. Time Warner stock rose 2% after hours.

Ever been forced to do something you adamantly opposed.""After conducting that interview, Agent 1 texted: ""I'm done interviewing the President"" — referring to Clinton.There's also the fact that Agent 1 found what he believed to be instances of people lying to the FBI — including Hillary Clinton — but did nothing.The IG report says that Agent 1 interviewed ""a witness who assisted the Clintons at their Chappaqua residence.""

At one point she texts Agent 1 referring to Trump's ""supporters like the ones from ohio that are retarded"".On Election Day, she texted that Clinton ""better win ... otherwise i'm gonna be walking around with both of my guns … and likely quitting on the spot"". Later she sent a text saying ""f(---) trump.""The IG report unearthed other such nuggets, such as the text from ""FBI Attorney 2,"" who said after the November election: ""Viva le resistance.""So who are these FBI officials? Why do they get to remain anonymous when others, like Page and Stzork, are already public? Are they still at the FBI? If so, what are they doing?This week, eight lawmakers sent a letter to the IG demanding the names.""These individuals need to be held accountable and only transparency will ensure that action,"" the letter states.Naturally, when the IG confronted these FBI officials with their texts, they all denied up and down that their views about the investigation or about Clinton and Trump in any way, shape, or form colored their efforts.Right.Yet, somehow the IG swallowed their excuses so it could report finding no bias in the investigation, a claim that stretched credulity with increasing strength the closer one looks at the report itself.Which leads to the next burning question about this report: Was it watered down by officials at Justice and the FBI who were able to review it before it got published?Earlier this month, Rep. Andy Biggs sent a letter to the IG asking to see original drafts of the report.""We are concerned that during this time, people may have changed the report in a way that obfuscates your findings,"" the letter, signed by two other congressmen, says.Meadows says he believes the FBI officials also may have altered documentation of witness interviews.Given the recent track record of these highly politicized agencies, these lawmakers are right to want to see any such changes.Meanwhile, the IG says it found ""instances where FBI employees improperly received benefits from reporters, including tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events.""But the report simply states that an investigation into that troubling revelation is still ongoing.

671,KEY,"Retail sales rose in May by the most in six months, exceeding forecasts and bolstering expectations for an acceleration in economic growth this quarter.The value of overall sales advanced 0.8% from the prior month, double the median estimate of economists and following an upwardly revised 0.4% gain in April, according to Commerce Department figures on Thursday. So-called retail control-group sales — a key measure that excludes food services, auto dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations — rose 0.5%, also exceeding projections.The results add to signs that lower taxes, elevated confidence and a strong labor market are helping to cushion the blow to Americans' wallets from higher fuel expenses. Solid gains in household purchases — the biggest part of the economy — and steady business investment are among reasons growth is projected to regain momentum in the second quarter.Estimates for retail sales in the Bloomberg survey ranged from unchanged to a 0.6% gain. Excluding purchases of autos and gasoline, sales climbed 0.8%, also the most since November and topping projections.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits fell by 4,000 to a five-week low of 218,000 last week, adding to signs of a tight job market. Continuing claims for two weeks ago dropped to 1.7 million, the lowest since December 1973.The strong labor market and solid economic growth are among reasons why Federal Reserve policy makers raised interest rates Wednesday for the second time this year and projected two more hikes in 2018. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News earlier this month saw gross domestic product expanding at a 3.3 percent pace this quarter, up from 2.2 percent in the previous three months.Ten of 13 major retail categories showed monthly gains in May, according to the Commerce Department data. Clothing stores had their biggest advance in more than a year at 1.3% and building-materials vendors saw a 2.4% rise, the most since September, when demand got a boost from post-hurricane rebuilding.The only sectors to show declines were furniture and home furnishings, with a 2.4 % drop — the most since 2013 — along with sporting goods and hobby stores and food and beverage sellers.The Commerce Department figures aren't adjusted for price changes, so higher gasoline expenses boosted retail sales, which can be volatile from month to month. Filling-station receipts in May increased 2 percent, the most since November, reflecting a jump in fuel prices that are near the highest level since 2014.While costlier fuel leaves people with less money to buy other goods and services, the latest results suggest Americans are benefiting from steady job and wage gains, along with lower taxes enacted by the Trump administration.Purchases at automobile and parts dealers rose 0.5%, consistent with recent reports that showed May vehicle sales were surprisingly strong, with gains at automakers including General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F).Receipts at restaurants and bars climbed 1.3%, the most since January 2017.Non-store retailers, which includes online shopping, rose 0.1%, after a 1.5% gain in April.General merchandise stores stores saw the biggest gain in almost a year. The department stores subcategory soared 1.5%, the most since January 2017.Control-group sales, which are used to calculate gross domestic product, rose at a three-month annualized pace of 5%, up from 2.8% in April

672,KEY,"The U.S. and North Korea agreed to seek complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula following a historic summit between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, yet the accord set no deadline and left the path to disarmament undefined.Trump defended the two-page document he signed with Kim at the end of their meeting in Singapore earlier Tuesday, saying that he thinks his North Korean counterpart will live up to to it. ""It's very comprehensive,"" the president said. ""It's going to happen.""Even with Kim's promise to eliminate his nuclear arsenal, Trump said the U.S. will maintain economic sanctions on Pyongyang until North Korea's nuclear program is ""no longer a problem."" He praised Kim for entering into negotiations with the U.S., a longtime foe.""People thought this could never take place,"" Trump told reporters. ""It's a very great day, it's a very great moment in the history of the world.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe signing ceremony and Trump's news conference capped a four-hour summit in Singapore aimed at easing decades of tensions between adversaries that only last year seemed on the brink of nuclear war.For both leaders, the summit represented a major gamble, and its outcome was being dissected around the globe for a sense of whether one of the world's greatest security threats — Kim's nuclear stockpile — can be eliminated. The talks were seen as a key first step to formally ending the Korean War, which remains unfinished after a 1953 armistice.During the signing ceremony, Kim said the agreement ""heralds a new start, leaving the past behind."" He added: ""the world will witness a major change now."" He left the summit site before Trump's news conference and didn't address reporters on his own.Under their agreement, Trump committed to provide unspecified ""security guarantees"" to Kim, as the two sides promised to continue talks. It said nothing about how the two countries would reach the goals, and ""complete denuclearization"" — the key point of contention between U.S. and North Korean negotiators — wasn't spelled out.The document doesn't include the words ""complete, verifiable and irreversible"" — the baseline U.S. demand for denuclearization before lifting sanctions — and omits Kim's previous pledges to halt missile and nuclear testing. Trump insisted that their agreement will include verification.""It will be achieved by having a lot of people there,"" he said.Even as their accord left major questions unresolved, the two sides did succeed in striking a friendlier tone. Trump told reporters after the summit that Kim had accepted an invitation to visit the White House, and that he would be willing to make a trip to Pyongyang at the ""appropriate time.""""Our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to a very much different situation than it has in the past,"" he said.Trump added that the U.S. military would suspend some military exercises that North Korea has regarded as a threat to its security, but offered no specifics about which war games would be affected.Mintaro Oba, a former U.S. State Department official who worked on North Korean issues, said the declaration ""was the minimum necessary to consider the summit a success — no premature concessions, and no escalation of tensions.""China hailed the outcome of the summit, saying the talks should spur the United Nations Security Council to revisit sanctions aimed against Pyongyang.""Sanctions are a means not an end,"" said Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""We believe the Security Council should make efforts to support the current diplomatic efforts and contribute to the political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue.""Trump and Kim kicked off their summit with a handshake shortly after 9 a.m. local time Tuesday — 9 p.m. Monday in New York — marking the first face-to-face encounter between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader.As the meeting opened at the Capella Hotel on Singapore's Sentosa Island, the two men entered with somber expressions that quickly gave way to smiles. Moments earlier, Trump had announced his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, had been sent to the hospital after suffering a heart attack.""It's my honor, and we will have a terrific relationship, I have no doubt,"" Trump said in brief remarks to reporters moments after their history-making handshake.""It was not an easy journey,"" Kim said earlier. ""We've had a past that stopped us from advancing, and wrong behaviors and practices sometimes closed our eyes and ears.""Trump was joined in the talks by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who played a crucial role setting up the summit, National Security Adviser John Bolton and Chief of Staff John Kelly. Kim was accompanied by North Korean Vice Chairman Kim Yong Chol, Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho and former Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong.Just meeting with Trump marks a diplomatic accomplishment for Kim, who has emerged from isolation in recent months and rapidly increased his outreach to other world leaders.By sitting down with an American president — a longtime goal of North Korea's government — Kim's regime is advancing its effort to establish its ""reputation, respect, and credibility as a nuclear weapon state,"" said Michael J. Green, senior vice president for Asia and Japan Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Trump wants the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Kim is seeking a security guarantee — and possibly a peace treaty — and the removal of the U.S.'s nuclear umbrella protecting allies South Korea and Japan.Kim has rejected calls to unilaterally give up his weapons in return for economic aid, and instead has proposed a step-by-step denuclearization process. His public statements and state-run media indicate he wants a deal to ease sanctions, but that he won't give up his nuclear weapons until he feels safe enough to retain power without them.Shortly after agreeing to the meeting in March, Trump used grandiose language to describe its prospects — at one point saying that North Koreans had already agreed to give up their nuclear weapons.In recent weeks, however, Trump significantly scaled back his public expectations for what meeting Kim would accomplish — at one point he referred to it as a ""get-to-know-you situation."" He also began saying that it would likely take several meetings to accomplish his goal, downplaying the importance of the first summit.Yet Pompeo on Monday drew a firm line, saying the U.S. plans to keep sanctions in place until North Korea eliminates its nuclear weapons capability. Complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization, he told reporters, ""is the only outcome that the United States will accept.""Yet the top U.S. diplomat added Trump is ready to offer ""unique"" guarantees to ease the regime's concerns about giving up a nuclear arsenal that provides a deterrent against foreign adversaries while also serving as a key point of national pride.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Futures Dip After Trump-Kim Summit; These 4 Stocks Are Big Movers

673,KEY,"Tesla kept charging higher and continued to work on its new base, while software companies also helped sustain the Nasdaq composite's leadership in stocks today. Meanwhile, the market presents at least four new reasons why investors should stay bullish on growth stocks.The tech-rich Nasdaq composite gained more than 0.5%.At that level, the premier index for growth stocks has now climbed 509% from its March 2009 low of 1265.The S&P 500, hampered by sell-offs in the ship transport, meat, oil drilling, mortgage services, and aerospace and defense industries, was mostly flat after rising nearly 0.3% intraday. The Dow Jones industrial average edged about 0.2% lower. Volume was running mildly higher vs. the same time on Monday on both main exchanges.Kirby (KEX), part of IBD's fourth-ranked Transport-Ship industry group, sailed sharply lower.

This Investor's Corner discusses how a big undercut of the 50-day moving average (see a daily chart) or the 10-week line (weekly chart) can present a timely sell signal to lock in gains.The positive step forward toward a goal of a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula is hurting names such as Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and L3 Communications (LLL).Raytheon, down 2.5%, has been cooling off beneath its 50-day moving average. Watch for a new potential base to form.Meanwhile, futures traders are counting a virtually 100% probability that the Federal Reserve will execute another quarter-point hike in short-term interest rates on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank has been raising rates since December 2015, when the fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%.Tesla (TSLA), as noted in this recent Stock Market Today column, is still fashioning the right side of a brand-new base. However, the stock is still feeling the overhead supply of sellers near 350, a critical level of upside price resistance. At 341, the stock is now less than 13% below its all-time peak of 389.61.Sentiment appears to be warming to the high possibility that the electric-vehicle pioneer is getting past serious difficulty in ramping up Model 3 production. On Tuesday, CEO Elon Musk announced a 9% cut in total staff, centered on salaried employees. A company memo to employees said that no production associates got laid off.The company seeks to get profitable while also meeting the tremendous demand for its entry-level all-electric car. The planned staff cuts should reduce total headcount to 37,000.Tesla shares show a terrible Relative Price Strength Rating of 25 on a scale of 1 to 99. But as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B on a scale of A to E. A rating above the neutral C grade means that over the past 13 weeks, institutions have likely been accumulating the stock on net.In IBD's automakers group, only Ferrari (RACE) and General Motors (GM) show better Accumulation/Distribution ratings than Tesla at A- each. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Tesla swinging from a net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018 to a net profit of $2.46 a share in 2019. Both estimates have recently moved up.Meanwhile, the market is showing at least four new reasons why the stock market's six-year bull run (after a 20%-plus correction in 2011) may have more room to run.One, market breadth continues to improve. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been climbing for five straight weeks. This means that more stocks are advancing than declining. This also means that more high-rated stocks stand a chance of breaking out.Two, the new highs list remains robust. As seen in Monday's IBD-screened list, a total 325 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE hit 52-week or all-time highs, swamping the 42 names making new lows. More stocks hitting new highs boost the probability of breakouts.Three, leading stocks are outperforming the major indexes.Among the top 10-ranked names in the IBD 50, the average gain approached 3%.Four, investor sentiment is not wildly optimistic. On Tuesday, the put-call volume ratio stood at 0.68. During the March 2000 tech market top, this ratio of bearish put options to bullish call options sank beneath 0.4. Such a low ratio pointed to a severe evaporation of bearish sentiment among options traders.The Investors Intelligence report on newsletter editors also shows the bullish ratio at 52.9%, well below its mid-January peak of 66%.

675,KEY,"A trade war. Rising interest rates. Anti-EU sentiment in Europe. A nuclear showdown with North Korea. After a series of worries — or even shocks — to start the year, what jolts await in the stock market forecast for the next six months?After an unusually calm and productive 2017 for the major stock indexes, 2018 has been like a ride over sand dunes. The S&P 500 ended a 10-month winning streak in February. The market that seemed unflappable in 2017 became sensitive to headlines and faced new risks.The first tremors came Feb. 5. Stocks plunged as new inflation signs sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to a four-year high of 2.88%. The Nasdaq went on to slide nearly 12% in February, its worst decline in two years. For the first time since June 2016, IBD's market outlook was downgraded to ""correction.""The market recovered, but the volatility remains with the recent gyrations over the tit-for-tat trade drama.""We're in the late stages of one of the longest bull markets in U.S. history, and this year's volatility comes as investors wonder when and how it could end. Every potential threat is magnified,"" Christopher M. Hyzy, chief investment officer for Bank of America Global Wealth & Investment Management, said in a midyear review.Yet for all its mood swings, the stock market made progress in the first half comparable to the six-month mark of 2017. The Nasdaq is still the leader, up 8.8%, with the S&P 500 up just 1.7%. At the end of June 2017, the Nasdaq was up 14.1% and the S&P 500 8.2%. The Dow has lagged more. It's down 1.8% compared with a year-ago gain of 8%.Growth investors who have navigated the ups and down have found plenty of opportunities. Dozens of breakouts have resulted in sizable gains. Heart implant maker Abiomed (ABMD) soared as much as 125% from a breakout in early January. Adobe Systems (ADBE) climbed nearly 40% from a January breakout. Leaderboard, one of two IBD stock-picking products, is up about 18% in the first six months.But the current stock market faces big hurdles. Trade disputes with China, Canada and other nations threaten to raise costs for many industries and consumers. Some fear President Trump's tariffs may trigger a full-blown trade war and a recession. The Federal Reserve has signaled four interest-rate increases for this year, one more than was forecast at the end of last year. Foreign markets are much weaker than a year ago. Will these risks derail the market?Right now the IBD's Market Pulse puts the rally under pressure. Think of it as a caution flag in the wake of heavy selling in the latest week. But if the Nasdaq and S&P 500 can regain their footing yet again and push higher for the rest of year, the credit will likely go to four themes driving the current stock market.By asset class, small-cap stocks have been a big driver of the 2018 market. The Russell 2000 is up 7%. That's nearly as much as the Nasdaq, which has been dominated by major gains from Amazon (AMZN) (45%) and Netflix (NFLX) (105%). President Trump's push for import tariffs and retaliatory moves have made small caps relatively more attractive because of their domestic focus. In other words, small-cap stocks have less exposure to foreign markets.There are other reasons. Last year's tax cut reduced the effective tax rate of Russell 2000 companies from 33% to 21%, says Scott Hood, CEO and Portfolio Manager for First Wilshire Securities, a Los Angeles firm that specializes in small caps.By sector, technology, health care and financials have contributed the most to small caps' performance. This year's outperformance in small-cap stocks reflects a shift from a period that saw big caps dominate, Hood says.""Small cap returns are similar to large caps for the trailing five, four and three years, but small caps begin to pull ahead in periods of two years or shorter,"" Hood said.But value stocks have lagged among small-cap stocks. It's been the growth camp of small caps that shouldered the increase. The Russell 2000 growth index is up about 15% this year, vs. 8% for the Russell 2000 value index.Larger stocks show a similar trend. The S&P 500 Value index declined 3.5%, while the S&P 500 Growth index was more than 6% higher over the same period.Big earnings gains typically drive the best stocks higher. The same generally is true for the overall stock market. S&P 500 earnings growth in the first quarter topped 20% for the first since 2010, extending a sharp recovery in profits. S&P earnings rose 25% in Q1 as nine of 11 S&P sector posted double-digit gains, according to FactSet. Q1 also had a record number of profit surprises, with 77% of companies beating EPS estimates. That ties for the highest since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. Technology had the highest percentage of beats: 90% of companies exceeded earnings forecasts.But the excellent earnings didn't necessarily translate to big rewards for shareholders. Stocks often had a muted response to strong results, and data show it's getting harder to impress investors.S&P 500 companies that beat expectations in Q1 saw their share prices rise a modest 0.2% on average in the two days before and the two days after the earnings report, FactSet found. That's way below the five-year average increase of 1.1% for earnings beaters. That's the fifth consecutive quarter that profit winners lag the five-year average. In Q2 and Q4 of last year, the price reaction to positive profits was negative, on average.As profits expand, comparisons will become harder to beat. Some moderation in profit growth is expected. FactSet estimates that for the second quarter, companies are expected to report earnings growth of 19% and revenue gains of 8.7%. For Q3, earnings are expected to grow 21.4% and revenue 7.5%. For Q4, profits are seen rising 17.2% and revenue 5.8%. For the whole of 2018, earnings are estimated to rise 19.8% and sales 7.6%. Upward revisions to these numbers would push the market higher, while lowered expectations could become a serious drag.Among 67 stocks in IBD's database that went public this year, the average gain from the IPO price is more than 30%. That includes winners such as Huya (HUYA), DocuSign (DOCU) and iQiyi (IQ), which have given back big chunks of their advances.The IPOX index, which tracks stocks that have gone public in a trailing four-year period, is up 7.5% this year. That's in line with the Jan. 1-June 22 average for the past five years of 8.3%, according to Chicago-based IPOX Schuster. From a year-ago level, the index was up 21.7%.Pay special attention to new companies that are profitable and growing, or at least expect to turn profitable. Take Huya, which analysts expect will grow earnings in the triple digits the next two years.In 2017, foreign stocks and ETFs generally performed about as well as Wall Street. Many experts expected them to outperform in 2018 partly due to high U.S. stock valuations. But in fact, the U.S. is nearly alone, far outperforming major global indexes and emerging markets.Each region and country seems to have its own reason for flopping this year, whether it was corruption, trade squabbles, a populist wave or a commodity shock. But if there was a single factor that touched foreign markets, it's been the strength of the U.S. dollar, says Dina Ting, Head of Global Index Portfolio Management at Franklin Templeton's LibertyShares ETF family.In Asia, for example, Japan is a bedrock of good valuations, low unemployment and solid fundamentals, Ting says. Brazil, where the Bovespa's 20% drop this year, would qualify as a bear market, and Templeton sees an attractive market. The firm offers exposure to Brazil with its Franklin FTSE Brazil ETF (FLBR). Brazil's sell-off, Ting adds, ""has been priced into the markets already.""IBD's 2018 market outlook on Jan. 1 noted that since 1963, the S&P 500 averages a 7.5% gain in the years following a 15% or higher annual gain. So far this year, the S&P lags that average, but is still higher.The question is: Will this continue? The return of market volatility makes forecasting the second half of 2018 more difficult. Three factors loom large.Companies facing new tariffs were punished twice: first by the risk of higher costs and then by investors who sold off shares. On June 21, for example, Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) warned that Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made cars will likely hurt profits. Daimler's U.S. shares fell 4.5% on the news; Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) skidded 5.9%. Many Chinese stocks were bludgeoned in June as tariff issues intensified.Each headline on tariffs also shook the broad stock market. But with no clear direction on tariff policy, U.S. indexes often battled back from tariff-related selling. For example, on June 20, when the European Commission approved a 25% duty on $3.2 billion of imports on U.S. products, the Nasdaq made a new high.The looming trade war is the biggest uncertainty on Wall Street. While all-out conflict has yet to materialize, some economists sense a growing danger. President Trump's mercurial views on the subject only add to the uncertainty.""A decline in confidence and supply chain disruptions could amplify the trade shock, leading to an outright recession,"" Michelle Meyer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist, warned in a research note. ""We continue to believe that the probability of a full blown trade war is low, but the risks are rising and it remains a key uncertainty to our outlook.""As the Federal Reserve has grown hawkish, the yield curve has flattened. Some analysts wonder if the Fed will overshoot its target, the type of policy error that has marred the central bank in the past. Just like it was in February when the stock market crumpled, monetary risk remains an issue with broad implications.Whenever the yield on the 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, it's a pretty good signal that a recession looms. The U.S. is not there yet, but the trend is headed in that direction. The spread between the two yields was 100 basis points a year ago. Today, it is around 35 basis points.""We are actually concerned about the shape of the yield curve because market worries of a 'Fed mistake' are gaining real traction,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a June 18 note. ""The yield curve seems destined to go to zero in the next 3 to 6 months. After that, the recession fuse is lit and stocks can still rise but they are living on borrowed time.""Polls continue to show the Republican Party losing control of the House of Representatives in November, although the margin is narrowing. But with Senate control and Trump in office, the GOP would still wield considerable power in Washington.""We think it is fair to say that markets have embraced the business-friendly aspects of a Trump White House and Republican-controlled Congress. At the margin, they would therefore prefer this status quo over a shift in House control to Democrats,"" Colas said on June 21.""The cross currents of sector/market cap returns year to date do not indicate a strong market view on midterm elections. ... Regional bank stocks — one group with clear exposure to Republican-led deregulation — have done well this year.

677,KEY,"Autohome (ATHM) is the IBD Stock of the Day and provides a lesson on how a double-digit gain can vanish quickly.Autohome on Monday flashed a sell signal as the stock went on an unwanted round trip. That's when a stock gives up everything it gained from the breakout. It's also a reason to pay close attention to your portfolio during a rough day on the stock market.Chinese stocks like Autohome, Alibaba (BABA), JD.com (JD), Baidu (BIDU) and others were getting hammered Monday amid continuing trade-war threats between the U.S. and China. President Trump increased his threats over the weekend, planning to stop Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology companies.Autohome is a leading online market for automobile consumers. Its cloud platform for used-car sellers now covers more than 35,000 dealers.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAutohome stock is benefiting from burgeoning sales of automobiles online and the growth of China's urban middle class for whom the car is a status symbol.The stock hit a buy point of 107.64 on May 30, a day before the company was added to the closely watched MSCI indexes of China stocks. Company shares jumped 6.3% that day to close at 109.07. The stock broke above the 107.64 buy point from an ascending base, considered a rare but bullish chart pattern that can lead to powerful gains.The IBD Stock Of The Day column can help you understand, for example, the right time to buy a stock, and the optimal time to sell. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.It consists of a series of three pullbacks, each ranging from about 10% to 20% from the most recent high to low. Each of the pullbacks must mark a higher high and a higher low — thus, the ascending base. However, both Autohome and Atlassian (TEAM) provide the lesson that in a weakening market, an investor should always prepare an exit plan even after a leading stock produces this key chart pattern.And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an ascending base in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.Autohome stock came public in December 2013, soaring more than 75% on its first day of trading. The Autohome initial public offering IPO raised $133 million, pricing shares at 17. The online automotive advertising market in China has achieved rapid growth as a result of the development of China's automotive and Internet industries. China is the largest market for car sales globally, but only an estimated 54 out of 1,000 Chinese own cars.Autohome makes money mainly from advertising. It also has growing sales in auto finance and data products.But where there is market opportunity, there is also competition. Autohome competitors include BitAuto (BITA), a provider of online data and services for China's automotive industry.More competition is emerging from China-based Uxin. The company offers one of the largest used-car e-commerce platforms in China, in terms of both the number of transactions facilitated and total GMV in 2017. Uxin is scheduled to commence an initial public offering, pricing shares Tuesday and trading Wednesday. It aims to raise $437 million by offering 38 million American depositary shares at a price range of 10.50 to 12.50. That gives it a fully diluted market value near $3.5 billion. It will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker UXIN.Autohome was on the exclusive list of IBD Leaderboard stocks. It was taken off the list Monday, along with Alibaba.Autohome stock flashed a sell signal Monday, erasing a double-digit gain from the 107.64 buy point. Autohome stock plunged 5.6%. closing at 108.03 on the stock market today.Alibaba, meanwhile, gave up the 200 level with conviction early Monday. Alibaba shares were down 5.7% to 190.54.Autohome reported first-quarter results on May 8 that topped analyst estimates as it guided second-quarter estimates higher.

685,KEY,"Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) grabbed a bullish analyst view on Monday, nearly a week after it unveiled ""landmark"" data for a gene therapy to treat boys with a muscle-wasting disease.JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko assigned a 275 price target to Sarepta stock — nearly double the shares' value today. At the close on the stock market today, Sarepta dipped 1.9%, to 137.74, amid similarly bullish views that sent rival Solid Biosciences (SLDB) up 2.6%, to 43.15.Sarepta's gene therapy, called micro-dystrophin, is under investigation as a Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment. Sarepta has an approved drug for the same use called Exondys 51. It works by exon skipping, a form of RNA splicing that skips over faulty or misaligned sections of genetic code.If approved, micro-dystrophin could chip away at sales of Exondys 51 and other exon-skipping drugs in Sarepta's pipeline, Bayko said. But gene therapy is also potentially curative, meaning Sarepta and others in the same position are eyeing high prices.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Management indicated the price for AveXis' (now Novartis' (NVS)) gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy at $2 million is too low, so we bookmark it between $2 million and $8 million which represents the net present value of 15 years' worth of exon skipping,"" Bayko said in a report to clients.Sarepta assumes it could grab approval for an exon-skipping drug called golodirsen by year's end. It also sees approval for a similar drug called casimersen roughly nine months later. The biotech company notes that it's likely micro-dystrophin will cannibalize some of those sales.The ongoing test assumes micro-dystrophin can work as a Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment for 70% of patients, Bayko said. That statistic is based on the specific parts of the genetic code that need to be skipped.Micro-dystrophin is created using what's called an adeno-associated virus. The virus doesn't cause disease, but prompts a very mild immune response. About 15% of patients couldn't enroll in the ongoing test due to antibodies in their blood that would make them immune to the drug.But Sarepta is looking at strategies to overcome pre-existing antibodies. The ongoing study is in patients ages 4-7, but Sarepta also has plans to test micro-dystrophin in younger and older children. Further, exon-skipping drugs could still have a role to play.The biotech company has some preclinical evidence showing there could be a benefit of using exon-skipping drugs prior to gene therapy. The biotech company also sees exon-skipping drugs as monthly maintenance therapy following gene therapy.""Either of these strategies would support substantial upside to our base case, where we assume the gene therapy cannibalizes revenues from the exon skippers,"" she said.The biotech company will likely accelerate enrollment in its next study, which will dose 24 more children in what's called ""Cohort C."" These patients will be tested for functional improvements at the year mark, Bayko said.The Food and Drug Administration may allow Sarepta to use the Cohort C study as the basis for approval. Sarepta will soon meet with the FDA to determine how to structure the study and its key goals.Those goals might be tailored to the gene therapy. The root cause of muscular dystrophy is a lack of dystrophin, a protein tied to muscle function. Sarepta will likely look for the OK to use increased micro-dystrophin as a measure of success in the study.The biotech company could also boost sales by using gene therapy as a treatment for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Bayko doesn't currently include that use for the gene therapy in her model for Sarepta.But ""Sarepta could mitigate the expected drop and plateau in gene therapy sales, in part by the staggered introduction of (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy) gene therapies which have significant overlap with the micro-dystrophin construct,"" she said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

687,KEY,"As a theatrical production, last weekend's G-7 had it all: young French knights unhorsed in a joust; Wagnerian heroines sinking into despair; and the King's privy councilors bellowing about betrayal, backstabbing and burning in hell.But there was one thing even more unsettling than all the sturm und drang over the Trump administration's rejection of the G-7 Communiqué: the document itself. Its plot can be summed up in three little words: ""tax and spend.""Yes, the clash over trade policy is deeply concerning. Hopefully the posturing and tariff threats will be of short duration — and the solution to the (thus far mostly theoretical) trade war will not involve any new ""plurilateral"" and ""inclusive"" agreements (to quote the Communiqué).And there was one positive in the Communiqué: language demonstrating solidarity on North Korea, Russia, Syria, and terrorism, as well as talk of unity in the face of threats to world peace by China and Iran. One of the main reasons the G-7 was established was for the mutual security of the Western market democracies.But a careful examination of the rest of the Communiqué — and how it would affect American taxpayers — leads to just one question: Why did it take Trump so long to reject it?Code words embedded in key sections of the Communiqué should set off alarm bells:This chestnut appears in every Communiqué. And civil servants and politicians in every G-7 nation regularly cite them to justify more government spending on the problem. For them, the condition of the environment is always a sign of market failure rather than an opportunity for market-based solutions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Communiqué also doubled down on the Paris Climate Agreement, an ineffective but costly pact from which the U.S. wisely exited last year. The agreement would not have made a dint on global temperatures. However, as my Heritage Foundation colleague Nicolas Loris has noted, it would open the door to ""egregious regulation, cronyism, and government spending that would have been as disastrous for the American economy as it is proving to be for those in Europe.""Who is to decide what is ""fair?' Again the Communiqué tilts away from a free market and toward whatever the state decides constitutes ""fairness.""There's the word ""fair"" again. What does it mean? Well, the Communiqué supports an OECD proposal aimed at centralizing and ""harmonizing"" global tax rules. By harmonizing, they mean raising effective tax rates on international firms to European levels — not lowering them to levels more compatible with economic growth. Naturally, most of the firms affected would be American. Odd, how the G-7 focuses only on collecting more taxes, never on cutting taxes and reducing government spending.Evidence from where? Sustained by whom? Such loaded phrases practically beg for preordained, politically correct answers that leave little room for solutions other than very expensive statist health care.As Jeffrey Smith and Alex Gladstein recently noted in Quartz Africa, Western policies and programs aimed at achieving the UN's SDG goals carefully avoid mention of concepts such as corruption, genuine human rights, and real functioning democracy. The unfortunate, practical result is to bolster the power of authoritarian dictatorships in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. They know that, by merely paying lip service to lofty SDG goals, they will appease any serious efforts to rescue the roughly 4 billion people under their rule.The American people need relief from recklessly expanding federal spending and the leviathan state it supports. Much of the G-7 Communiqué, on the other hand, reads like a blueprint for ever bigger government.President Trump's decision not to endorse it was the right one. Perhaps other G-7 leaders will re-examine its underlying assumptions and present a more prudent and fiscally balanced set of recommendations next year.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

688,KEY,"The final day of the Morningstar Investment Conference 2018 (MIC) got underway in Chicago with a panel discussion of the pros and cons of investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and blockchain, the computer-based record keeping system that underlies digital currencies.XThe four panelists ranged from advocates like Jim Sinegal, Morningstar equity analyst for banking and payments, and Adley Bowden, vice president of market analysis at PitchBook, to cryptocurrency skeptic Philip Straehl, head of capital markets and asset allocation for Morningstar's Investment Management group.Straehl said he bases investment worthiness on an asset's valuation as determined by the worth of its future cash flow — and cryptocurrencies have zero cash flow. The only thing that can raise their prices is willingness of other investors to pay more than you did, he said.Depending on what he called ""the greater fool"" to raise an asset's value makes the asset speculative, he said, and it's not something he would recommend to a client.In a press briefing before the panel session, Sinegal said cryptocurrencies may be volatile, but so are works of art by recognized artists. ""I tried to sell (Straehl) my Monet, but he said no — it has no cash flow,"" Sinegal joked.In the panel discussion, Straehl said that blockchain will likely spawn companies that benefit from that technology's development. But it is too early to identify companies whose stocks will benefit in that way.Likewise, it is also too soon to know which stocks will lose business from the growth he expects to see in blockchain. Investors should short those losers once they are identifiable, he said. Winners and losers may come from banks, securities exchanges, credit reporting companies and marketplaces, Sinegal said.In a later Wednesday morning session, David Herro, portfolio manager and chief investment officer of international equity at Harris Associates; and Diana Strandberg, director of international equity at Dodge & Cox, participated in a discussion of global equities.Herro said that as a general rule it is important for an investor to distinguish between good companies and good investments. Valuation is the key to doing that, he said.It is more difficult to determine valuation in some markets than others, the two noted investors agreed. ""We're not huge fans of certain countries, like Russia,"" Herro said.Still, investors can find good stocks in markets they are otherwise wary of, Strandberg said. Brazil's Itau Unibanco Holding (ITUB) is one such stock she likes. It was a top-five holding of $61.2 billion Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund (DODFX) as of March 31.Itau's dividend yield is 2.14%.

The stock is forming a cup base with an 89.40 entry point. Chevron (CVX) was flat at 127.07. Shares are poised for a breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 131.18 buy point. BP (BP) dipped 0.2%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) lost 0.5%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarlier Wednesday, Trump tweeted that OPEC was ""at it again"" and that oil prices were ""too high,"" even as his decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran could cause oil prices to go even higher.Iran's OPEC governor later told Reuters ""You cannot place sanctions on two OPEC founder members and still blame OPEC for oil price volatility,"" referring to itself and Venezuela.The International Energy Agency warned that economic turmoil in Venezuela and renewed sanctions on Iran will likely remove 1.5 million barrels per day from the market by the end of 2019.This could lead to a supply gap in crude late next year if OPEC can't make up for lost production, the IEA said in its monthly report Wednesday. The IEA said OPEC countries in the Middle East could quickly boost production by 1.1 million bpd.""Even if the Iran/Venezuela supply gap is plugged, the market will be finely balanced next year, and vulnerable to prices rising higher in the event of further disruption,"" the report said. ""It is possible that the very small number of countries with spare capacity beyond what can be activated quickly will have to go the extra mile.""Trump's tweet comes ahead of a key OPEC meeting with Russia on June 22 to discuss raising production for the first time since 2016, when they began cutting production by a 1.8 million barrels per day.Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration asked OPEC and Russia to boost oil output. OPEC reported in its monthly oil market report Tuesday, that Saudi Arabia has already increased production.But the U.S. request and a Trump tweet in April that blamed OPEC for high oil prices has caused a split within the oil group, with some members accusing Saudi Arabia of being too eager to do Trump's bidding.Meanwhile, IEA sees non-OPEC supply rising by 2 million bpd this year, lead by growth from the U.S. But infrastructure and logistics could constrain growth and the IEA only sees supply growth of 1.7 million bpd in 2019.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Why The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under WaterOil Stocks And Industry News

692,KEY,"The Morningstar Investment Conference 2018 (MIC) for financial advisors shifted into high gear with keynote addresses by Kunal Kapoor, CEO of Morningstar, and Charles Schwab (SCHW) CEO Walt Bettinger on Monday afternoon.Their sessions followed a warm-up series of presentations by Morningstar experts on a range of topics, many introducing new tools by Morningstar.The crux of Bettinger's presentation was that advisors — who form the bulk of more than 2,000 attendees at the MIC — must work hard to help clients and to build their own practices. Advisors are basically active managers when it comes to serving clients' needs, Bettinger said. The key to serving clients' interests, Bettinger said, ""is getting to know and serve other people.""Bettinger illustrated his point by confessing that in his own earlier days as a student he had failed to ace a final examination that he had gone into with high confidence. It turned out that the instructor asked a single question. What was the name of the classroom building's cleaning lady? Bettinger did not know her name was Dottie. He described his oversight as the result of focusing on his own interests rather than the interests of hardworking people around him. Bettinger's point was that advisors also should put their clients' interests ahead of their own.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSimilarly, many individual investors do not know the fine points of what makes someone a fiduciary, he said. But they do know they want ""someone they trust like a fiduciary,"" he said.Bettinger's presentation was mostly a question-and-answer session, moderated by Tricia Rothschild, chief product officer for Morningstar.Preceding Bettinger, Kapoor sounded a similar theme. ""Great advice is personal, efficient and innovative,"" he said.By personal, Kapoor meant that service must serve the real interests of clients. That may differ from ideas that clients hold. Some clients, for example, want to imitate neighbors who brag about owning a stock that is hot. Instead, Kapoor said, their role model should be their neighbor who is in fact a millionaire but also frugal.Advisors should also learn how to cater to clients who, for instance, want their investments to reflect their personal goals and ideals. For millennial clients who want to invest in low-carbon footprint companies, advisors should learn more about ESG (environmental, social, governance) investing, Kapoor said.RELATED:Morningstar Investment Conference 2018: News From Gathering For Financial AdvisorsAmazon Who?

695,KEY,"It has been a week full of wins for President Donald Trump — at least for those who share Trump's view of the way the world works, and perhaps even for some who don't.Exhibit A is Trump's summit meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore. In their self-congratulatory joint statement, they said that North Korea committed to ""work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" and the United States agreed to ""provide security guarantees"" to North Korea.Critics said that that's not airtight language and argued that Kim came out better than the author of ""The Art of the Deal."" He got Trump to call for the cancelation of U.S.-South Korea military exercises in August in return for promises that his regime has repeatedly broken.Trump was having none of this. In place of the ""fire and fury"" he threatened not so long ago, he rhapsodized about new condominium developments. And unlike previous U.S. negotiators, his diplomacy was very personal: The president who began his Manhattan real estate career at 25 noted that Kim took power at 27.Similarly personal was the appeal in the four-minute video created by the National Security Council. Of 7 billion people on Earth, only a few can make a difference, the narrator said, adding that history need not be repeated but can evolve. That's hokey, critics said, but ""Dilbert"" creator Scott Adams, who famously predicted Trump's election based on his persuasive powers, said his ""first reaction"" to the video was that ""it might be the best thing that anybody ever did in a negotiation. Period.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe personal touch, by the way, distinguishes Trump's outreach to North Korea from former President Barack Obama's to Iran. The Iranian regime is a group project with many leaders who have ideological and economic interests in continuing hostility toward the United States. Obama's hope that he could change its outlook clearly went unrealized.Kim's regime, in contrast, appears highly personal, one in which the leader can order the sudden deposition and death of an uncle who is a key official. That regime's behavior, Trump is betting, will change if he can change the mind of one man.Of course this may not work out. The argument is that nothing else has, and with North Korean nukes now poised to hit the West Coast, it's worth trying. ""The world is safer than it was a week ago,"" writes veteran Washington Post foreign affairs columnist David Ignatius, ""and Trump is getting some deserved global applause.""""In expected value terms, this is the biggest triumph of the Trump presidency,"" blogs contrarian economist Tyler Cowen. ""The negative commentary I am seeing is mostly sour grapes, misplaced frustration, and it is weak in the quality of its argumentation.""Trump's almost-affectionate treatment of Kim is something like the relationship — making friends with supposed enemies — that he's cultivated with rapper Kanye West. In this case, the obvious goal is that he and his party will improve on the 8% he won from blacks in 2016.And make no mistake; it's his party — something that seemed highly unlikely when he rode down that escalator three years ago this month. Trump has near-unanimous job approval among self-described Republicans, and his clout in Republican primaries was demonstrated in one of his smaller victories this week.Just three hours before polls closed in South Carolina on Tuesday, Trump tweeted his endorsement of Katie Arrington against 1st District incumbent and frequent Trump critic Rep. Mark Sanford. The challenger got 50.6% and avoided a runoff by just 366 votes. Did the tweet make the difference?Another apparent Trump victory came without much notice, as House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy blocked the efforts of some moderate Republicans and all House Democrats to get the 218 signatures required to trigger a roll call on a bill that would legalize the so-called ""Dreamers,"" young immigrants in the country illegally who were brought here as children, without strengthening immigration law enforcement.That was not the deal Trump had in mind when he promised to sign a bill legalizing recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and strengthening enforcement. Ryan and McCarthy promised roll-call votes next week on such a bill sponsored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte and another as yet to be drafted by Republican moderates.These developments may not turn out to be Trump wins. The immigration bills probably won't pass and will fall short of Trump goals; Trump endorsement tweets may produce unelectable nominees; negotiations with North Korea may go nowhere.But maybe, as Trump has predicted, we're going to get tired of so much winning.Trump's High-Risk Game Of Nuclear 'Deal Or No Deal' With North Korea's KimTrump Gets High Marks For Handling North Korea: IBD/TIPP Poll

Before Friday's tumble, Red Hat stock was up 84% over the last 12 months.There were several reasons for the lowered guidance. They included unfavorable foreign exchange rates and increased competition. There was also some unexpected weakness with subscription revenue and renewals.

That left the financial software provider more than 150% above its May 24 IPO price.The list's only other gains for the week came from stocks outside China: Mellanox (MLNX) and Orion Engineered Carbons (OEC). Both are extended from buy points.Among the week's more interesting chart action, software developer Atlassian — headquartered in the U.K. with its operations in Australia — added a tenth week to an unusual base pattern.Atlassian's cloud-based products help direct project-management and team collaboration within large companies and government agencies. IBD Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW) is a key competitor, as are Box (BOX) and the start up Slack. In addition, Microsoft (MSFT) entered the market in early 2017 with its own products. It moved more seriously into the space early this month with its $7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub.Atlassian has also been an acquirer, paying $425 million for Trello in January last year. Analysts expect to see more deals.Despite the competition, consensus views see Atlassian earnings rising 33% this year and 40% in 2019. Revenue growth is projected at 34% and 30%, respectively, over the same two years.Atlassian shares are up about 42% so far this year. The advance has been saw-toothed, with many highs and lows, including a breakout attempt that failed in February. At the same time, the gains have been loosely cradled by the stock's 10-week moving average.The result sets up the perfect circumstances for an ascending base, considered to be a rare but bullish chart pattern. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.The result is a three-lobe base that forms over a nine-to-16 week period. Each grotto within the base forms higher highs and higher lows. The final high provides the position of the buy point.In Atlassian's case, the base began during the week ended April 20. The buy point is at 68.85. The stock has been trying to clear that entry but fell almost 5% early Friday, testing support at its 10-week moving average before paring losses to around 2%. That left shares down a bit more than 2% for the week.While the base is considered rare, IBD Leaderboard and Global Leaders stock Autohome (ATHM) broke out from an ascending base May 30 with a 107.64 buy point.And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an ascending base in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.By Thursday, Atlassian's relative strength line had leveled out at new highs.

706,KEY,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day. General Motors (GM) reports U.S. auto sales for the second quarter just after Tesla reported production jumped 55% in Q2. Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Toyota Motor (TM) and other automakers report June sales results. GM stock and other auto stocks aside from Tesla have retreated in recent weeks as the Trump trade war turns to auto tariffs.June sales are likely to be strong, thanks in part to an extra selling day and weekend this year, industry analysts say. The annualized pace of U.S. auto sales in June is estimated to rise to 17.1 million after dipping to 16.9 million in May, according to Edmunds. Fiat Chrysler, Toyota Motor and Ford Motor should grow sales 7%, 4% and 1%, respectively. But Nissan is likely to see sales shrink 7% from a year ago.GM sales release Tuesday will be the automaker's first on a quarterly basis since it abandoned monthly reports in April.Trade concerns hammered most auto stocks in June.GM warned Friday that if President Donald Trump charged ahead with tariffs, the move could result in ""less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages"" for its workers. The Association of Global Automakers, comprised of 14 carmakers, also pushed back against the proposals to impose high tariffs on vehicle imports and auto parts on national security grounds.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""These tariffs will harm today's U.S. auto industry ... and tariffs will substantially increase prices for consumers,"" John Bozzella, president of the group, said last week, adding ""retaliation against U.S. exports is inevitable.""But Trump on Sunday told Fox News that he sees auto tariffs as the ""big"" weapon in trade negotiations to force other countries to give concessions.Shares of GM rallied to close up 0.3% at 39.51.  GM technically is in a cup-with-handle base with a 45.10 buy point last month. But shares are more than 10% below the buy point. Ford rose slightly while Toyota and Honda edged lower on the stock market today, all mired well below their 50-day moving averages.Fiat Chrysler rose 1.1% but also sits below the 50-day line.Tesla jumped more than 6% intraday on its Model 3 production success, but reversed to trade down 2.3%.German automakers are seen as most at-risk from Trump trade war fallout. Their stocks have been among the biggest losers in recent weeks. Daimler (DDAIF) last month warned on full-year profit, citing the impact of Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles.The specter of tit-for-tat tariffs from China, Europe and other key markets comes at a tense moment for automakers. Car site Edmunds sees several challenges in the auto market, which could be near a tipping point.""The strength of the economy is creating a very thick forcefield for automakers now, but once that starts to weaken, there are a lot of market factors bubbling just below the surface that could really start to slow down sales,"" said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds. ""Even though millennials are finally starting to buy new vehicles, the U.S. market is virtually saturated. Add to that record-high vehicle prices, rising interest rates and historically high numbers of people who owe more than their cars are worth, and the stage is set for a market contraction.""Both industry experts and carmakers expect the annualized pace of U.S. auto sales to dip below 17 million in 2018, for the first time in years.Meanwhile, automakers are investing staggering sums of money in developing self-driving cars, though consumers remain cool on the idea.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Tesla Meets Goal Of 5,000 Model 3 VehiclesToyota: Trump Tariffs On Autos Would Undermine National SecurityHere Are The 5 Biggest Dow Jones Stock Losers This YearRetail, Energy Among Top Stock Plays As Sector Rotation OccursIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists

Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) and General Motors (GM) headed early gains among automakers. An update from Micron Technology (MU) following a China court ruling on Tuesday, and an analyst upgrade to Qorvo (QRVO) stirred an early advance among chipmakers.The Nasdaq Composite led the early gains, scaling up 0.7% as Micron led the Nasdaq 100.

Year-to-date through the end of June, announced layoffs ran 8% above 2017 levels.Private, non-farm employers added 177,000 new workers in June, ADP reported in its National Employment Report. The number, often seen as a precursor to the government's official payrolls report due out Friday, was sharply below May's 189,000 new hires. It was also short of the 199,000 added jobs expected by economist consensus. Services-sector employers provided the bulk of the new jobs, with manufacturing adding 16% of June's total.First-time unemployment claims edged higher in the week ended June 30, the Labor Department reported. That was narrowly above the prior week's 228,000 applications.

China's regulators initially planned to launch their response, with duties targeting $34 billion in U.S. made imports, at 12:01 a.m. Beijing time. That would have effectively imposed tariffs on U.S. goods beginning just after noon, Thursday, on the U.S. East Coast.A statement Wednesday from China's ruling State Council said ""China absolutely won't fire the first shot."" That suggested China would not launch its tariffs until noon, Beijing time, on Friday.The Shanghai Composite dropped 0.9%, giving it a 4% loss so far in its seventh-straight weekly decline. The benchmark entered a bear market on June 19. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.2%, down 2.7% for the week but it has yet to hit the 20% decline from its February high to qualify as a bear market.In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 slumped 0.8% on Thursday.

General Motors jumped 1.6%, spurred by news reports Wednesday that the U.S. and European Union were working on a compromise to the automobile trade tariffs question. Tesla pared an early gain to 0.6%. Ford (F) added 0.6%.Chip stocks showed early strength. Micron surged 3%, Qorvo swun 4.2% higher. Netherlands-based ASML Holding (ASML) notched a 2.1% gain.Micron said a patent-court ruling in China on Tuesday, which barred it from selling certain memory chips and products in the country, would lead to a 1% decline in fourth-quarter revenue. The court ruled Micron had violated patent rights of China-based UMC Technologies (UMC). Micron held its fourth-quarter revenue guidance steady at between $8 and $84 billion. The company said it would comply with China's ruling, while requesting the court ""reconsider or stay its decision.""Micron shares in June dropped more than 8% below a 63.52 buy point following a May 29 breakout.

708,KEY,"The next shoe to drop in President Donald Trump's China trade war was expected to land this week. Officials were expected to detail new investment restrictions and Trump export controls aimed at China by June 30, with semiconductor equipment a likely focus.But Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro in a CNBC interview and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a tweet tried to downplay the coming report, saying it isn't aimed at China directly. Mnuchin tweeted that investment restrictions would target any country that steals American technology. Navarro said there would be no investment restrictions.Stocks rallied into the close but still finished with deep losses. The Dow Jones industrial average closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time in two years, and that post-Brexit vote move two years ago only lasted a day. The S&P 500 index closed just above its 50-day line after trading below that key support most of the session. The Nasdaq composite skidded 2.1%.So has the plan that tanked the stock market really changed? It's hard to be sure, but it wouldn't be a shock. Although Trump threatened a full-scale trade war with China last week, he's also been working to save ZTE, the Chinese communications equipment firm that is the 4th biggest cell phone supplier to the U.S. market.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe logical explanation is that Trump really wants a deal with China. He's been wielding threats to help make it happen, but the stock market reaction on Monday may help convince him to back off a new threat that could make it impossible for China to return to the bargaining table.The biggest near-term concerns about the coming news drop have less to do with Chinese investment restrictions and more to do with Trump export controls.In a new analysis, Moody's Investors Service said that the toughest export restriction it envisions likely would be a ban on chip equipment sales to Chinese companies, which account for 6%, or $1.8 billion, of combined revenue for Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Shares of Applied Materials sank 2.6% in the stock market today, while Lam Research lost 2.1% and KLA-Tencor 2.3%.Total sales in China for those big three U.S. chip-equipment firms make up 18% of total revenue, including sales to non-Chinese companies operating in China. Moody's doesn't rule out the possibility Trump export controls could go so far as to ban sales of chip gear even to non-Chinese companies operating in China, such as Samsung, Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).Even if Trump export controls only cut off sales to Chinese companies, that could go a long way to deepening trade hostilities between the U.S. and Beijing.Such restrictions would ""severely limit China's ability to develop greater self-sufficiency in chip manufacturing,"" a key goal of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy, Moody's says.China aims to close the technological gap, dominate domestic markets and establish global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence. U.S. efforts to counter this threat point to an American technological cold war with China, regardless of Trump's combative approach to trade.""Outside of Applied, Lam and KLA, we believe alternative suppliers of the array of leading-edge semiconductor equipment that Chinese companies need to produce chips do not exist.""Just a week after the new restrictions are expected to be released, on July 6, 25% tariffs are set to take effect on roughly $34 billion worth of imports from China. Another $16 billion worth of goods could also face tariffs shortly thereafter. The second batch of Trump tariffs includes processor and memory chips.A study based on the preliminary list of goods to face Trump tariffs found that the bulk would hit multinationals from the U.S. and other countries besides China. The Semiconductor Industry Association said much the same thing on June 15 after the final list of products was released: ""The proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive and fails to address the serious IP and industrial policy issues in China.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:5 Reasons Why The Market Sell-Off Was Worse Than It SeemedHarley-Davidson Just Gave Trump Tariffs A Black EyeIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

709,KEY,"Welcome to the Dow Jones industrial average. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the newest stock on the blue-chip index, is the worst Dow Jones stock in the first half of 2018.General Electric (GE), which tanked 22% through June 30, is no longer a Dow Jones stock. That leaves Walgreens stock leading Dow laggards, followed by 3M (MMM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Caterpillar (CAT) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Each booked a double-digit loss through June. The Dow Jones index overall fell 1.8% over the same period, lagging a 1.7% advance for the S&P 500 index and an 8.8% gain for the Nasdaq composite.On a brighter note, the best-performing Dow Jones stocks of 2018 so far boast impressive gains.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe retail pharmacist took the Dow Jones seat that the embattled GE vacated Tuesday, but faces deep problems of its own.""Walgreens has struggled to cope with a rapidly changing pharmaceutical market with pressured reimbursement, massive consolidation, and increasing competition for prescription volume,"" according to Morningstar.Walgreens Boots Alliance faces increasing and direct competition from grocery chains and retailers. On Thursday, Amazon (AMZN) agreed to buy PillPack, making a decisive, long-rumored move into the pharmacy space.Walgreens, which reportedly sought the online pharmacy for itself, tumbled on the news, along with other drug stores and other pharmacy-related stocks.Walgreens stock peaked in January, then sank after Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) struck a healthcare partnership. The move potentially threatens Walgreens, which also manages prescription-drug plans and provides health care to store customers.But the pharmacy chain now counts on roughly 10,000 stores — after acquiring thousands of Rite-Aid (RAD) locations — to return to earnings growth.Shares of Walgreens dived 17.4% in the first six months of 2018.Industrial conglomerate 3M must reckon with a continued shift away from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, analysts say.That macroeconomic trend coincided with a severe downturn in its key power market. The company may now sell its gas-turbines unit, after earlier shedding rail, wind and health assets.3M stock sank April 24 after the company lowered its 2018 earnings guidance. It has yet to recover, sitting 26% below a January high of 259.77.Talk of trade wars and steel tariffs also contributed to the decline. Roughly 60% of 3M's revenue comes from abroad.But the company, well regarded for its R&D expertise, continues to scout for growth. It capitalized on automakers' quest to build profitable electric cars by announcing in June that it will invest in a battery factory.Shares tumbled 16.4% in the first half of this year.A household name, P&G's tepid top-line growth has come amid massive shifts in the consumer goods sector.Consumers increasingly choose niche, alternative brands over well-known names, while groceries and supermarkets have shifted from branded products toward more upscale, private labels. The Amazon-Whole Foods deal is set to further disrupt grocery aisles.This multinational also faces intense competition from local companies in emerging markets.However, P&G scored a victory in a recent proxy fight with Trian Fund Management. The Nelson Peltz fund wanted this Dow giant to focus more on innovative brands and less on legacy products.P&G shares dropped 15% in the first half of 2018.Caterpillar's woes just grew beyond volatile commodity prices, an uncertain outlook for global infrastructure and construction spending — and loose-lipped execs.It's among companies that face potentially higher negative impact from a Trump trade war that is expanding in scope and reach, research firm CFRA said last week.Caterpillar, a top construction and equipment maker, operates around the globe. China's crackdown on emissions is a potential headwind, but there are other risks.""As urbanization slows or Chinese central planners decide to de-emphasize construction, Caterpillar's resources business could suffer,"" analysts at Morningstar say. But they add restructuring efforts are starting to pay off and heavy equipment demand is starting to recover.Caterpillar stock tanked 6% April 24 after its CFO described Q1 operating margins as a ""high watermark"" for the year. The company later tried to walk back those remarks, but the damage was done.Caterpillar stock lost 13.9% in the first half of this year, with losses accelerating in the last few weeks.The investment banking giant saw trading activity roar back to life in the first quarter, helped by market volatility. But Goldman Sachs stock skidded in March after reports of CEO Lloyd Blankfein's looming departure. Losses accelerated in April after management shared plans to put share buybacks on hold.Late Thursday, the Federal Reserve let most U.S. banking giants announce big stock buybacks and dividend hikes after passing the second round of stress tests. But Goldman and investment bank peer Morgan Stanley (MS) will have to keep shareholder payouts around current levels due to a capital shortfall.Bank stocks, in general, have suffered recently from a flattening yield curve and ebbing consumer confidence. Their 2017 rally, fueled by tax overhaul and rising rates, seems a distant memory now.In May, Goldman Sachs analysts said Amazon (AMZN) has an ""opportunity to expand in financial services,"" but is unlikely to launch a standalone bank.This Dow Jones stock sank 13.4%.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Futures Rise With These 2 Tech Titans In Buy ZoneStock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What Can You Expect?If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersWhat Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average And What Does It Measure?

711,KEY,"President Donald Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Wednesday as he seeks to preserve a deal to rescue Chinese communications equipment giant ZTE that may hold the key to averting a bruising China trade war.""We're working on it,"" Trump said of White House efforts to address congressional concerns that going soft on ZTE sends the wrong signal about taking on China over intellectual property theft, which has national security dimensions.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a ZTE critic, expressed optimism after the meeting to reports.""I think there's a path forward to address the president's concerns as well as national security,"" Cornyn said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBy late July, if not sooner, we'll know whether Trump prevailed over Congress and whether a China trade war is really on.On Monday, the Senate voted 85-10 to reinstate a ban on U.S. component suppliers selling their wares to ZTE, without which it's had to halt operations. The move was a direct challenge to Trump, who had softened the Commerce Department's penalty for repeated violations of sanctions on North Korea and Iran and pledged via tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast.""If Trump really intended to launch a major China trade war, the last thing on his mind would be saving ZTE's 70,000 Chinese jobs. Yet late Monday, Trump escalated his threats toward China, directing his administration to draw up tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.Investors took the threat seriously, with the Dow Jones industrial average sinking close to 300 points as Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and other companies with big exposure to China came under pressure. But Trump's saber-rattling appears aimed at Congress, not Beijing. If Trump appears tough enough on China and lawmakers begin to worry about a full-scale China trade war, they'll be more likely to bow to the White House's wishes with respect to ZTE.The Dow Jones edged lower on Wednesday, declining for a seventh straight session. But the Nasdaq composite hit a record high, advancing 0.7%.If the U.S. backs off its harsh sentence for one of China's premier tech hardware firms, the countries might be able to work on a trade deal that Trump was crowing about just a month ago. China had agreed to buy an additional $70 billion worth of American goods, including ""massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products."" But as the U.S. pushed for further concessions, Beijing appeared to walk away from the bargaining table as the Senate moves put ZTE's fate in jeopardy.While U.S.-China negotiations are suspended, the clock is ticking toward the July 6 start of a trade war. That's when the U.S. said it will apply 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech imports. Beijing has said that it plans to immediately retaliate, dollar for dollar. Another $16 billion worth of Chinese imports could face tariffs shortly after July 6, pending further review.But the process may come to a standstill if Congress acts quickly. The Senate's ZTE provision is part of a must-pass defense-funding bill. But the Senate version must be merged with House legislation that would apply much narrower restrictions on ZTE. It's not clear whether the final bill will come together before the July 4 recess. So a China trade war could stay on a low boil for the next month or so, until ZTE's fate becomes clear.July 25 is another key date. That's the latest deadline for the Qualcomm (QCOM) merger agreement with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Like the rest of the U.S. trade negotiation with China, the deal appears tied to the fate of ZTE. Chinese regulators have refused to grant antitrust approval to the chip merger, but appear ready to do so when the ZTE ban is lifted.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:If You're Long Netflix Or Square, Read ThisThese 2 FANG+ Stocks Are In Buy RangeIBD Stock Of The Day: Online Payment Leader PayPal Hits Buy ZoneStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

That's a $1.2 trillion annual rate, and far more than the $35 billion one year before.The BEA's analysts explain why this happened: ""The large magnitudes (of inward capital flows) ... reflect the repatriation of accumulated earnings by foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational enterprises and their parent companies in the United States in response to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.""In short, the Trump tax cuts did it.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

So in the first three months of 2018 alone, some 12% of that overseas stash came back to the U.S. It's now available here for companies to invest, pay out in dividends and bonuses, hire new workers, purchase new plants and equipment, or just buy back stock.It's a shot in the arm for the U.S. economy.Of course, you say. It's entirely logical to suppose that by slashing the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% — a 40% reduction — and by giving one-time breaks to those companies that had piles of cash sitting overseas, money would flow back into the U.S. After all, Trump's 21% tax rate is now lower than the current OECD average corporate tax rate of 25%.But last year, when the tax cuts were still a topic of conversation, some in the media seemed to have trouble with this idea.""GOP tax bill and overseas profits: Beware the hype,"" ran a headline on the PolitiFact website.""Why the GOP tax plan to repatriate offshore profits may flop,"" said a CBS News topper.""AP FACT CHECK: Trump and the mirage of overseas profits,"" yelled the AP's not-so-subtle headline.These and other critiques were of the same ilk, using a 2011 Congressional Research Service study to show why the Trump tax cuts wouldn't work. That study looked at what happened in 2004, when President Bush and congressional Republicans temporarily cut taxes on repatriated profits to 5.25% from 35%.At the time, the idea was to return financial capital to the U.S. And it worked. Some 843 companies brought back $312 billion.But, the AP found the cloud's dark lining, noting ""those companies tended to use the money to buy back shares of their own stock, not to hire or expand operations."" The CRS report itself found that the tax break ""did not increase domestic investment or employment.""These assertions need a little context, however.First, the 2004 profit-repatriation tax break was a one-time event. The Trump tax cuts, in addition to giving companies a break for repatriating overseas profits, cut corporate taxes overall. So the impact will be longer-lasting — permanent, if the Congress makes it so, as it should.Also, recall that 2004 was a mere three years after the end of the worst stock-market plunge since the Great Depression. Companies' shares were recovering, but many were still beaten down. So buying their own shares, which bolsters a company's financial solvency, looked like a smart move at the time.And also remember: Interest rates, as measured by the Fed funds rate, were rising sharply back then. From a low of 0.94% at the start of 2004, rates surged to just below 2% at the start of 2005 and over 4% by the start of 2006. That's a fourfold move in two years. Even so, the U.S. unemployment rate during that period fell from 5.4% in 2004 to 4.9% in 2005 and 4.4% by 2006.Today, no doubt, these same critics would say the same thing. Despite rising interest rates, job growth is more than healthy and key measures of unemployment are close to 30-year lows. Incomes are rising, even as 6 million high-skilled jobs can't be filled. Jobless claims are at all-time lows. It's the healthiest job market in decades.Yet the befuddled media keep calling these bullish economic data ""unexpected.""Well, these weren't ""unexpected"" by those who said that tax cuts would work like a charm to boost growth. In the second quarter of this year, GDP growth is almost certain to exceed 3%, again. The Blue Chip consensus of economists expect 3.5% growth, while the Atlanta Fed's ""GDPNow"" estimate is at 4.7% currently.This happened only because President Trump slashed taxes, cut regulations and in general pursued powerful supply-side stimulus that lifted the economy's ability to produce goods and services.For the record, GDP growth never topped 3% in any year of Obama's administration. We were told repeatedly by left-leaning economists and pundits that the days of 3% growth were over. We would have to trim our sails and rein in our expectations for the future.Donald Trump wasn't listening. He still isn't. The Washington Examiner's Paul Bedard reports Trump recently talked about 5% growth, saying, ""You ain't seen nothing yet.""Sure, bad things can happen between now and the end of the year. There are shaky economies overseas, including both China and Europe, made all the more sensitive by President Trump's talk of trade tariffs.After two years of spectacular gains, stock market investors might head to the sidelines for a while. And if the Fed panics and starts raising rates in an anti-inflation frenzy, something it has done repeatedly in the past, it might once again bring down the economy.Even so, thanks to the tax cuts, literally hundreds of companies have handed out bonuses, raised base pay, and created new benefits for workers. The money that is flowing back into the U.S. is part of that success, creating jobs and income for American workers. Those who say otherwise are, once again, wrong.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Left's Unhinged Response To Trump Tax Cut Reveals Their Real Fear: What If It Works?Don't Wait For The Trump Boom — It's Already HereNo, The U.S. Isn't 'Undertaxed'Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

714,KEY,"President Donald Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Wednesday as he seeks to preserve a deal to rescue Chinese communications equipment giant ZTE that may hold the key to averting a bruising China trade war.""We're working on it,"" Trump said of White House efforts to address congressional concerns that going soft on ZTE sends the wrong signal about taking on China over intellectual property theft, which has national security dimensions.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a ZTE critic, expressed optimism after the meeting to reports.""I think there's a path forward to address the president's concerns as well as national security,"" Cornyn said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBy late July, if not sooner, we'll know whether Trump prevailed over Congress and whether a China trade war is really on.On Monday, the Senate voted 85-10 to reinstate a ban on U.S. component suppliers selling their wares to ZTE, without which it's had to halt operations. The move was a direct challenge to Trump, who had softened the Commerce Department's penalty for repeated violations of sanctions on North Korea and Iran and pledged via tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast.""If Trump really intended to launch a major China trade war, the last thing on his mind would be saving ZTE's 70,000 Chinese jobs. Yet late Monday, Trump escalated his threats toward China, directing his administration to draw up tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.Investors took the threat seriously, with the Dow Jones industrial average sinking close to 300 points as Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and other companies with big exposure to China came under pressure. But Trump's saber-rattling appears aimed at Congress, not Beijing. If Trump appears tough enough on China and lawmakers begin to worry about a full-scale China trade war, they'll be more likely to bow to the White House's wishes with respect to ZTE.The Dow Jones edged lower on Wednesday, declining for a seventh straight session. But the Nasdaq composite hit a record high, advancing 0.7%.If the U.S. backs off its harsh sentence for one of China's premier tech hardware firms, the countries might be able to work on a trade deal that Trump was crowing about just a month ago. China had agreed to buy an additional $70 billion worth of American goods, including ""massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products."" But as the U.S. pushed for further concessions, Beijing appeared to walk away from the bargaining table as the Senate moves put ZTE's fate in jeopardy.While U.S.-China negotiations are suspended, the clock is ticking toward the July 6 start of a trade war. That's when the U.S. said it will apply 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech imports. Beijing has said that it plans to immediately retaliate, dollar for dollar. Another $16 billion worth of Chinese imports could face tariffs shortly after July 6, pending further review.But the process may come to a standstill if Congress acts quickly. The Senate's ZTE provision is part of a must-pass defense-funding bill. But the Senate version must be merged with House legislation that would apply much narrower restrictions on ZTE. It's not clear whether the final bill will come together before the July 4 recess. So a China trade war could stay on a low boil for the next month or so, until ZTE's fate becomes clear.July 25 is another key date. That's the latest deadline for the Qualcomm (QCOM) merger agreement with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Like the rest of the U.S. trade negotiation with China, the deal appears tied to the fate of ZTE. Chinese regulators have refused to grant antitrust approval to the chip merger, but appear ready to do so when the ZTE ban is lifted.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:If You're Long Netflix Or Square, Read ThisThese 2 FANG+ Stocks Are In Buy RangeIBD Stock Of The Day: Online Payment Leader PayPal Hits Buy ZoneStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

717,KEY,"U.S. President Donald Trump accused Harley-Davidson (HOG) of using new tariffs on trade as cover for an existing plan to shift some production abroad and threatened the motorcycle manufacturer with a ""big tax"" on bikes imported to the U.S. if it relocates some plants overseas.X""A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country — never!"" Trump tweeted Tuesday. ""Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end — they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!""The company said in a government filing Monday that it may move some production outside the U.S. in response to European retaliation for the president's tariffs on imported metals.But Trump took issue with that in a series of early-morning tweets Tuesday.""Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it,"" Trump said.The president followed up by warning the company that goods produced overseas and imported back into the U.S. could be taxed. ""Harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!"" Trump said on Twitter.A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end — they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich said in April that the factory in Thailand was a ""Plan B"" that Harley employed after the U.S. abandoned the 11-country Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement Trump withdrew from last year. He'd said they didn't relish the investment, which he also said was needed to maintain access to a key market.The early-morning missive from the president marked the second consecutive day Trump took aim at the iconic motorcycle maker, after the company said in an SEC filing on Monday that tariffs enacted by the European Union in response to Trump's penalties on imported steel and aluminum would add as much as $100 million a year to its costs.""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the U.S. to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,"" the company said.Harley shares fell 1.3% in early trading Tuesday in New York after tumbling 6% Monday, the biggest drop in almost five months. The stock is down 18% this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Monday, Trump said he was surprised the motorcycle manufacturer ""would be the first to wave the White Flag.""""I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the EU, which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion,"" Trump continued. ""Taxes just a Harley excuse — be patient!""In a subsequent tweet, Trump said the U.S. is managing to get other countries to lower existing tariffs and barriers that he said have been in place for years through bad deals. ""We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!"" he said in the post.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the announcement earlier Monday, saying Trump's ""trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy.""""The European Union is attempting to punish U.S. workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies, and President Trump will continue to push for free, fair and reciprocal trade in hopes that the EU will join us in that,"" Sanders told reporters at the White House.Tariffs have also forced the hand of the maker of another iconic American brand, Jack Daniel's.Brown-Forman (BFB), which also produces Woodford Reserve and other bourbons, will have to raise prices for its whiskey sold in the European Union following the implementation of a 25% tariff, according to spokesman Phil Lynch. The higher prices, which he said would primarily affect Jack Daniel's, would amount to about a 10% increase for consumers.Lynch did not say what effect the expected price increases would have on European sales, noting that ""we continue to invest behind the growth of American whiskey in the EU.""Brown-Forman fell to its lowest level in almost seven months on Monday.The EU's levies are only the latest blowback Harley has faced from Trump's trade policies. A year after Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 12-nation trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in January 2017, Harley announced it would close its factory in Kansas City, Missouri, and consolidate production in York, Pennsylvania, eliminating about 260 jobs.Trump hosted Levatich and other Harley executives and union leaders for a White House listening session in February 2017 and hailed the motorcycle manufacturer as ""a true American icon"" and ""one of the greats.""""Thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America,"" Trump said at the time. ""I think you're going to even expand. I know your business is now doing very well and there's a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren't having so much in the last number of months that you have right now.""Harley-Davidson's headquarters are in Milwaukee, and on Monday the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who has opposed Trump's move to impose tariffs, said the company's announcement was evidence of the detrimental effect of the president's trade policy.""This is further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs,"" AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said Monday. ""The best way to help American workers, consumers, and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market.""Lawmakers weighed in Tuesday on Trump's latest tweets.""What I'm worried about is that it's just the first of many that we are going to see as a result of tariffs,"" Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, told CNN in an interview to discuss Harley's announcement that it would move some production abroad.""I don't know all the details but from what I saw was it would be a $2,200 increase on the final price per bike with these tariffs,"" Congressman Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, told CNN in a separate interview. ""That's going to impact sales.""""I don't have a problem with the president taking on China,"" Kinzinger added.

729,KEY,"The fast-growing $3.6 trillion U.S. market for exchange-traded funds is closer to getting a shot in the arm after Wall Street's main regulator advanced a proposal for streamlining its approval process for the products.The Securities and Exchange Commission plan approved for public comment on Thursday would make it easier to bring new ETFs to market by laying out formal steps for setting up less-complicated funds. The change would eliminate the need for many issuers to seek a special order from the SEC to allow funds to operate. Commissioners voted 5-0 to release the proposal for public comment.The mutual fund industry has long complained about the wait and cost associated with getting the regulator to sign off on new funds, while critics say the current system based on one-off approvals gives advantages to more established firms. The SEC tried to address the issue in 2008, before shelving a plan that aimed to ""eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens"" as it focused attention on dealing with the global financial crisis.""The proposed rule would cover most ETFs operating today and all similar ETFs that sponsors may seek to launch in the future,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said before the vote. Replacing the current exemptive orders under which many products operate would ""level the playing field,"" he said.Clayton said the new rule wouldn't cover all products and that some would continue to require greater scrutiny. Complex, leveraged products wouldn't be eligible for the streamlined process.In her prepared remarks, Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein noted that the rule wouldn't cover so-called share-class ETFs, such as those run by Vanguard Group, which are structured as a separate class of a mutual fund. It will however give issuers greater choice about which securities they admit to the fund and which they give out — something the industry had called for.Clayton has made passing an ETF rule a priority since he took the helm at the SEC in May 2017. He hired Dalia Blass, who worked on the 2008 proposal, to lead the agency's investment management unit and listed the rule as a key part of his regulatory agenda.While ETFs started as a way for investors to buy into indexes like the S&P 500 and pay minimal fees and taxes, investors now can purchase funds that employ strategies such as leverage and short selling or focus on narrow, thinly-traded market sectors.The streamlined process the SEC proposed would target so-called plain vanilla ETFs, leaving firms wishing to list more complex products to seek approvals through the more laborious approach the regulator currently uses.Two top officials at the SEC are sounding the alarm over leveraged ETFs — even as the agency looks to streamline sales of simpler ETFs.Robert Jackson Jr., who holds a Democratic seat on the SEC, criticized a failure to address these ""dangerous"" funds in a proposed rule that would make it easier to bring plain-vanilla ETFs to market. Meanwhile, Stein posed a series of questions about who these products are appropriate for, and what their impact is on underlying markets. Leveraged ETFs ""pose real risks to American families,"" Jackson said. ""I'm worried that many investors are going to find out — too late — exactly how dangerous those products can sometimes be.""The funds in question are called ""leveraged"" because they hold derivatives that deliver a juiced-up form of their strategy to improve the performance of their portfolio. For example, the popular ProShares Ultra S&P 500 (SSO) uses these securities with the goal of providing twice the daily performance of the S&P 500 Index. Roughly 1% of the $3.5 trillion of assets in exchange-traded products is invested in leveraged vehicles, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Clayton, a political independent who was named by President Trump, said after the meeting that he was talking with Jackson about the issue. He indicated that the products could possibly be addressed as part of sweeping new conduct rules the agency has proposed for brokers and investment advisors. Any new regulation regarding the funds would require Clayton's support.""Leveraged ETFs and similar complex products are ones that you need to go through a lot of work to ensure that that type of product is appropriate for your customer,"" he said.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Apple, Tech Stocks Rebound As Nasdaq Leads AdvanceAre These 3 Market-Beating Tech Stock Plays Setting Up?Why Are These Top Stock Plays Trouncing The Market?

730,KEY,"PolarityTE (COOL) stock tumbled again Tuesday after losing more than a quarter of its value a day earlier when a short-seller called it a ""fraud"" based on allegations tied to its patent application.On the stock market today, PolarityTE sank 6.2% to close at 26.41. Earlier, the stock was down as much as 14.4%. The dive followed Monday's 27.3% plunge, which came after Citron Research called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the skin-replacement specialist.Short-seller Citron says PolarityTE should have notified investors when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a non-final rejection of an application to patent its SkinTE technology on March 31, 2017. The office later issued a final rejection on June 4, 2018, according to USPTO filings.PolarityTE, on the other hand, says it's still prosecuting against multiple patent applications — a legal process that involves negotiating with the USPTO for a patent.

""The office action is expected to be responded to within three months.""PolarityTE went public through a reverse merger with gaming company Majesco Entertainment in April 2017. Two months later it sold all gaming assets. Today, the firm is working on SkinTE, a rival to traditional skin-graft technology.Investor's Business Daily interviewed Chief Executive Denver Lough in May. An IBD article on June 18 focused on the technology, which removes an entire ""village"" of supportive cellular elements to regrow full-thickness skin for burn victims and to lessen the visibility of scars.For the article, IBD asked to interview an expert familiar with the technology. A spokesperson for the company connected IBD with Dr. Mark Granick, a professor and chief of plastic surgery at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.Both the company and Granick failed to disclose that Granick is a paid member of PolarityTE's clinical board of advisors. That fact is listed on PolarityTE's website, but isn't listed on Granick's public profile with the medical school.A spokesperson for the company told IBD in a follow-up email that advisory boards are normal for biotech and medtech companies.""These are small companies that seek input from those in research of clinical practice,"" the spokesperson said. ""I know that we didn't present Granick as someone other than (one) of the first users of the product who can talk about his experiences.""The article has since been removed from IBD's Investors.com website.Citron describes itself as a stock commentary website. It has previously published negative reports on fellow med-tied firms Inogen (INGN) and MiMedx (MDXG), as well as bigger tech firms like Twitter (TWTR) and Netflix (NFLX).The website cautions it usually has a short position in the securities it profiles.

But while these are well-known, liquid stocks, they all have pros and cons. Time to hit the stock charts.Apple has faded recently, but is still slightly extended from a conventional buy point. Tesla has run up to a key level as it closes on a possible breakout. FANG stock Alphabet is flirting with an entry, while Boeing is back in buy range, pulling back toward key support.Boeing and Apple are both Dow Jones stocks.Apple blasted out of a double-bottom base with a 179.04 buy point in early May. Shares rallied 17% over nine sessions, fueled by a triple whammy of strong earnings, a massive stock buyback and dividend plan, and news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had bought many more Apple shares in Q1.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn June 1, Apple cleared a three-weeks-tight pattern entry of 190.47. A three-weeks-tight breakout offers an opportunity for existing holders to add a few more shares. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, was trading at new highs after several months of flat to lagging action. (The RS line is blue line in the charts below.)However, Apple stock has drifted lower on the last several sessions. Apple sank 1% to 188.03 on Friday, back below its three-weeks-tight entry. Volume was nearly double normal, but a triple-witching expiry may have inflated trading, especially at the close.Apple stock closed Friday still slightly extended from the 179.04 entry, with the 5% chase zone extending to 187.99.Apple dipped into buy range shortly after the open in Monday's stock market trading, but closed down just 10 cents at 188.74.One big question is whether Apple stock is going to resume treading water. After all, Apple isn't going to announce a one-two-three punch of earnings-buyback-Buffett on a regular basis. Services growth is strong, but iPhone sales are sluggish.Tesla slumped from mid-September to early April, with its RS line peaking in June 2017. But since then the stock has bounced back, especially in the last few weeks. Tesla stock has rallied 30% since May 22, with nearly all of that in June.Shares rose 0.1% to 358.17 on Friday after hitting 364.67 intraday. Tesla stock has struggled around the 360 level several times over the last few months.But Tesla stock blasted through that resistance area on Monday, rose 3.5% to 370.83, hitting its best levels since late September. Volume was tracking sharply higher, continuing a bullish trend of solid price gains on active trading.Tesla stock is closing in on a buy point of 389.71.Keep in mind that Tesla's RS line is still well off highs.Also, Tesla's rise has come amid bold promises from Tesla and CEO Elon Musk. Musk says Tesla very likely will hit its Model 3 production target of 5,000 a week by the end of June. He also expects Tesla to be profitable in the third quarter. And Tesla has said it'll provide a big upgrade to Autopilot, which has been involved in several fatal accidents.If Tesla achieves or comes close to meeting those, its prospects will look brighter and the stock may keep rising. But if the electric automaker misses badly once again, then the stock rally could reverse.Google-parent Alphabet flirted with a breakout on Thursday and Friday, crossing the 1,161.20 handle buy point from a double-bottom base, but couldn't settle above it. Shares closed down 0.1% to 1159.27 on Friday.The RS line is at highs, but Google stock hasn't really outperformed the S&P 500 index since May 2017.Early Monday morning, Alphabet's Google announced a $550 million investment into Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (JD). That could help JD.com expand beyond China and Southeast Asia. Google will have less than 1% stake in JD. Walmart (WMT) also has a small stake in JD, which boasts Tencent (TCEHY) as a major shareholder and strategic partner.Alphabet stock rose 2.1% to 1,183.58, moving above the buy point, though volume was below average. Google also cleared an alternate entry of 1,178.26, just above the middle of the W in the double-bottom base.Boeing stock cleared a 347.77 cup-with-handle base on May 17. The handle wasn't visible on a weekly chart and volume on the breakout day was below normal. Volume was 32% above normal on the second day, which is OK but not great.The aerospace giant rallied in part on positive trade winds, as Trump appeared to have a tentative China deal. Shares became slightly extended but have since pulled back into buy range. On Friday, the U.S. and China imposed tariffs on each other, raising the risk of further escalation. Boeing stock fell 1.25% to 357.88 on Friday.

That unusual chart typically means a stock is winding up for a big move, especially if the overall market has been stalling then turns higher.Such a formation usually occurs among the strongest stocks when the general market comes under selling pressure.Ferrari's volume Wednesday is also robust, and the stock's relative strength line on a weekly chart is confirming the breakout.Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) rose 0.6%, General Motors (GM) added 0.6%, Ford (F) dipped 0.7%, and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) lost 0.6%.

Its Scuderia Ferrari team has won 16 constructors titles and 15 drivers titles. Its sporting heritage is a driver for the brand's prestige.Ferrari has been enjoying accelerating earnings and revenue growth in recent quarters.

737,KEY,"General Electric (GE) backed its earnings and cash-flow guidance Friday after reporting strong Q1 results, bolstering prospects for GE's dividend.The industrial conglomerate still sees full-year EPS of $1-$1.07, reaffirming it's tracking to the lower end of the range, as well as adjusted industrial free cash flow of $6 billion-$7 billion in 2018.GE expects to end 2018 with more than $15 billion in cash and doesn't see recent accounting changes impacting its industrial free cash flow, which supports GE's dividend. Cash flow was in line with the company's expectations in Q1 and improved $1.1 billion from a year ago.""Cash is front and center in every conversation,"" CEO John Flannery said in a conference call.Investors, including many who count on GE's dividend for retirement income, have been skittish about the payout since the company halved it last year. Plans to shed cash-generating businesses have added to dividend concerns, and last week's restatement raised worries about the earnings outlook.In fact, Goldman Sachs analysts said earlier this week that a cut to GE's 2018 EPS outlook is ""almost a certainty and could potentially happen as early as 1Q earnings.""Shares rose 3.9% to 14.54 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average for the first time since November, though the stock had been up as much as 7.6% earlier and is still down more than 50% over the past year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The power unit slid 9%, extending a slump.GE saw double-digit profit growth in its core health care and aviation markets in Q1, as well as in renewable energy. But power saw profits tumble 38%. Oil and gas profits fell 30%.Management said the jet-engine market is still strong, benefiting from strong growth in both domestic and international markets. The company is on track to deliver 1,100 to 1,200 next-generation Leap engines in 2018, although currently deliveries are ""about 70 units behind.""The aviation segment in particular is in the spotlight, after a jet engine made by GE's joint venture with Snecma blew apart in midair Tuesday, forcing a Southwest Airlines (LUV) flight to make an emergency landing and killing one passenger.Later Friday, the engine joint venture, CFM International, recommended expanded inspections of engines similar to one involved in the Southwest accident. The FAA is also expected to call for emergency inspection of CFM56-7B engines.GE sees the power market trending to less than 30 gigawatts for the next several years, further lowering its own expectations, as energy efficiency and growth in renewable energy have driven lower demand for coal- and gas-fired power plants.But Flannery said he sees ""green shoots"" as GE adjusts to the power market and improves execution. Those steps include plans for $1 billion in cost cuts this year, new leadership team in the supply chain, and exits from noncore power assets.Meanwhile, Honeywell's (HON) EPS rose 17.5% to $1.95, beating views by 6 cents, as revenue climbed 9.5% to $10.39 billion, above estimates of $9.94 billion.The company sees full-year EPS of $7.85-$8.05 on revenue of $42.7 billion-$43.5 billion.

738,KEY,"RH (RH), the upscale furniture chain formerly known as Restoration Hardware, is soaring after beating Q1 earnings views and lifting 2018 guidance late Monday, continuing a string of wild post-earnings stock swings.Estimates: Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect RH earnings to soar to $1.01 a share from 5 cents a share. Revenue should tick up 0.4% to $564 million. Same-store sales are expected to dip 0.9%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: Adjusted diluted EPS rose nearly 27-fold from the prior-year quarter to $1.33, on revenue of $557 million. Comparable brand revenue grew 1%.The major profit figure reflects ""the power of our new membership model, our unique and proprietary product offering, our efforts to revolutionize physical retailing, and our work designing a massively more efficient operating platform,"" said RH CEO Gary Friedman in a press release late Monday.Outlook: RH management raised full-year guidance to adjusted EPS of $6.34-$6.83 vs. prior outlook for $5.45 to $6.20. It reaffirmed revenue of $2.53 billion-$2.57 billion. Analysts expect $5.85 EPS and $2.555 billion.For the current quarter, RH sees $1.70-$1.77 EPS and $655 million-$662 million in revenue. Consensus is for $1.48 EPS and $658 million in sales.The company said it expects revenue to accelerate through the current quarter and the back half of the fiscal year. Four new galleries are planned for 2018 in Portland, Nashville, Yountville and New York; the latter three locations will feature wine bars, cafes and, in Yountville's case, an outpost of the Doughnut Vault. Hospitality is a growing business within RH.Friedman maintained his view that RH can be a $4 billion-$5 billion business in North America.Stock: Shares shot up 30% to 154.74 on the stock market today, setting their eighth straight gain and a record 164.49 intraday.Post-result big swings aren't unusual for this stock: RH has a history of major post-earnings moves, including a 22.5% surge the day after March's Q4 results, a 25.8% pop after November's Q3 pre-announcement, and a 44.8% jump after Q2 results. Last year's Q1 results prompted a 25.7% plunge.Shares of Williams-Sonoma (WSM) advanced 1.6%. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) climbed 0.2% and Pier 1 Imports (PIR) rose 2.1%, both erasing intraday losses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""You can't make that up, right?""RH's newer showrooms will occupy less square footage, but the company is going ahead with plans to open more locations.

739,KEY,"For a Federal Reserve meeting where a rate hike is seen as a given, the stakes are still huge for bond traders heading into Wednesday's decision.Investors have piled into front-end wagers and curve plays betting on the timing and pace of rate increases in the second half of the year and beyond. That leaves plenty of room for market moves depending on what Fed officials signal in a few key areas. Namely, their updated dot-plot projections and a potential change to the rate paid on excess reserves.""The importance of this meeting is to get a clear picture of the what-if scenarios for 2018, as there are a lot of balls up in the air,"" said Todd Colvin, senior vice president at futures and options broker Ambrosino Brothers in Chicago.Here are the corners of the market poised for the biggest post-Fed reactions.After May's Federal Open Market Committee minutes suggested that officials might only raise the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate by 20 basis points at an upcoming meeting, volumes across fed funds and eurodollar futures spiked as implied rates tumbled. After retracing somewhat, the July contract is now printing about 22 basis points above the Fed effective rate of 1.70%. That suggests traders see about an 80% chance of the Fed opting for the smaller IOER increase, according to John Brady, a managing director at R.J. O'Brien & Associates in Chicago.If officials do tinker with the IOER rate this week, traders will also look to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference for hints as to whether policy makers intend to use that approach again, or if this time would just be a one-off.If traders are wagering on any change in the FOMC's' median projection for tightening this year, there's a good chance they're doing it using the January 2019 fed funds futures contract. It's currently trading at 97.74, or an implied rate of 2.26%. That puts it squarely between three and four hikes by year-end.Should officials' updated dot plot forecasts show them leaning toward four hikes for the year, up from the three they flagged in March, the contract should see an immediate re-pricing as the market brings its expectations more in line with the Fed's. And if the dot plot stays at three hikes for 2018? Look for the January 2019 fed funds contract to rally.In the cash market, the shape of the yield curve is riding on the meeting's outcome too.After a mid-May pause, the flattening that dominated the Treasuries market for months has roared back, sending the gap between two- and 10-year yields toward 40 basis points once again. Tom di Galoma, managing director of government trading and strategy at Seaport Global Holdings, is among those favoring flatteners heading into the Fed decision. He says it's likely the Fed will signal rates hikes for both September and December.That view has been gaining traction in the markets even as some policy makers have warned that the threat of an inverted curve may cause the Fed to dial back its tightening plans.Traders continue to be stubbornly dovish on the pace of rate increases beyond 2018 relative to policy makers' projections. With the spread between December 2018 and 2019 eurodollar contracts now at about 35 basis points, traders are pricing in roughly one-and-a-half hikes next year, should FRA-OIS remain stable. That compares to the three that policy makers are signaling in the dot plot.If firming inflation and near-record low unemployment prompt officials to forecast a steeper path of hikes down the line — just as they did in March — traders would be in store for a major shakeout.

740,KEY,"When you start learning how to read stock charts, you'll have plenty of questions. What is a stock chart? What's in a chart? What's the best way to approach stock chart reading for beginners? Why even use charts?Learning how to read stock charts may seem intimidating at first. But with some basic tips and a little practice, you'll soon be using them to find winning stocks, to see how to buy stocks and to spot the right time to sell.In this first installment of our series on chart reading basics, you'll learn what's inside a stock chart. You'll also see why it's important to make chart analysis part of your regular investing routine, which can help you find breakout stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). And by using charts, you'll be able to run all your stock ideas and stock picks through a buying checklist and selling checklist.In the second installment, we cover the three key factors to look for in a chart. And in Part 3, you'll see how to spot the three most profitable chart patterns.Tip: See our free Stock Charts Decoded webinar for an overview of how to read stock charts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe first thing to understand about charts is that they tell you a story.Is the stock being heavily bought by mutual fund managers and other large investors? Or are these so-called institutional investors dumping shares as fast as they can?Is the stock finding a floor of support from which it can keep climbing higher? Or does it keep bumping its head against a ceiling of resistance?You can literally ""see"" that story as it unfolds once you learn how to interpret the price and volume action. By the end of this series, you'll be able to do just that.The second thing to understand about charts is that if you don't use them, you're essentially investing with a blindfold. You won't be able to see what's really happening with the stock.We all know share prices go up and down every day. But it's only by using charts that you can keep those fluctuations in perspective and understand whether it's time to buy, sell or hold.An investor who doesn't use charts is the same as an orthopedic doctor who doesn't use X-rays, or a cardiologist who doesn't hook up patients to an EKG machine.Doctors use these tools to spot patterns and anomalies, and to make a proper diagnosis. Savvy investors use charts for essentially the same reason. They help you understand the true health of a stock, and to spot timely buy and sell signals.So be sure to arm yourself with the tools of the trade. As IBD founder William J. O'Neil says, ""Fortunes are made every year by people who learn to properly read charts.""Here's a quick overview of the basic chart elements and related concepts. As you go through them, be sure to scroll down and check out the charts below for an explanation of the main elements you'll find inside IBD stock charts.Price And VolumeIBD charts are divided into two main areas: price and volume (i.e., the number of shares traded).It's critical that you look at price and volume together in order to understand the ""story"" a chart is telling. If you only look at changes in the share price, it doesn't tell you how serious the buying or selling is.For example, if a stock falls 2% one day, you might get nervous. But if the volume is far below average, it could be a sign that the larger investors who really drive the market are not selling aggressively. They're sitting tight, and maybe you should, too.Conversely, if a stock shows a nice gain but the number of shares traded is unusually low, that could mean it's just a head fake. If big investors were aggressively scooping up shares, you'd see a big spike in volume.These types of telltale clues — which you can only spot by using charts — let you see what is really going on with the stock.Moving Average LinesThe moving average lines simply track the share price movement over a set period of time. But they are absolutely crucial to understanding if a stock is being enthusiastically supported — or aggressively sold — by large investors.It's the big mutual fund managers and other institutional investors who have the buying power to push a stock sharply higher — or lower. And these money managers often use the moving averages as a point where they step in to protect and add to their positions.But watch out if a stock fails to find support at a key moving average like the 10-week or 50-day line. When a stock crashes below those benchmarks in heavy volume, it often means the stock has fallen out of favor with the big players.So always watch how your stocks behave when they're trading around their moving averages. Based on how they act, you'll know if it's time to buy, sell or just sit tight.Relative Strength LineWant a quick way to instantly see if your stock is a leader or a laggard? Check the relative strength (RS) line, which compares a stock's price performance to that of the S&P 500.A sharply rising RS line tells you the stock is outperforming the general market. An RS line that's trending down shows the stock is lagging the market.When a stock is nearing a potential breakout, look for the RS line to be rising and approaching or in new-high ground. Such action is a bullish sign of market leadership as a stock tries to launch a new run.What's In A Weekly Stock Chart?What's In A Daily Stock Chart?Newer investors often ask, Should I use daily or weekly charts? What's the difference between the two?The short answer is use both.The weekly chart gives you a longer-term perspective on the stock and its underlying trend. It also helps smooth out the daily price fluctuations so you can stay grounded and not get overly swayed by day-to-day volatility.The daily chart gives you a valuable look at the price and volume action at specific, time-sensitive moments, such as on the day of a breakout or when a stock is testing its 50-day line. On those occasions, the shorter-term daily charts help reveal the current ""story"" and what action you should take.So be sure look at both the weekly and daily charts. You can easily switch between the two using IBD Charts.In the next installment in this series on how to read stock charts, we'll go over in more detail the three key factors to look for in a chart: current trend, price and volume action, and support and resistance.Once you understand those concepts, you'll be ready to spot — and profit from — chart patterns like the cup with handle, double bottom and flat base.In the meantime, use the links below to immediately start improving your chart reading skills:Chart Reading For Beginners: 3 Telltale Clues To Look For In Your StocksChart Reading For Beginners: How To Spot The 3 Most Profitable Chart PatternsHow To Buy Stocks | When To Sell StocksImprove Your Investing Results With This Simple 3-Step RoutineRelated Books: How To Make Money In Stocks — Getting Started | Success Stories

741,KEY,"General Electric (GE) plans to expand in gene therapy with prefabricated viral drug factories that can quickly scale up manufacturing to reach more patients and lower costs.XGE's health care unit announced that the new KUBio ""ready-to-run factory-in-a-box"" can pump out viral vector-based vaccines, oncolytic viruses to treat cancer, and gene and cell therapies faster than a traditional, stick-built facility. If demand for a particular therapy proves strong, the factory can expand to increase output.This allows drug manufacturers to quickly adapt to market conditions, GE Healthcare said in a news release.Shares popped 3.5% to finish at 13.79 on the stock market today. GE also benefited from reports of a potential sale for its Jenbacher gas-engine unit. Bloomberg said the deal with power company Cummins (CMI) and a private equity firm could value the Austrian unit for more than $3 billion– $1 billion more than reports in January indicated.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe popularity of viral vectors, which use modified viruses to carry healthy genetic code into sick target cells, is on the increase.There are more than 700 viral vector-based therapies in clinical trials, GE's $18 billion healthcare business said. Several treatments — such as GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Strimvelis, Novartis's (NVS) Kymriah and Kite Pharma-Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Yescarta — already have received regulatory approvals.""The market is moving towards more targeted therapies designed for smaller patient populations,"" Olivier Loeillot, a GE general manager, said in Tuesday's statement. But existing large-scale factories are not ideal for drug manufacturers looking to produce small batches of therapies, he added.Additionally, the KUBio factories can help drug makers to lower costs.Many advanced drug candidates for treating Ebola — the deadly West African outbreak —also use viral vector technology. The factory-in-a-box solution can address challenges tied to producing vaccines, which are critical to people around the world but generate low revenue for their manufacturers, the company says.GE looks to grow in the gene therapy business as it battles a severe downturn in its gas-turbine and power-plant business.  The power unit is likely to show a hit when first-quarter results come out Friday.Gene therapy is a risky but promising technique that may one day  allow doctors to treat disorders without conventional drugs or surgery, according to the National Institutes of Health.

Fed policymakers see two more hikes in 2018 after raising rates on Wednesday.A federal judge OK'd the AT&T-Time Warner deal without conditions, rejecting the Justice Department's argument that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry. AT&T closed the $85 billion merger on Friday. The landmark ruling boosted share prices in media firms CBS (CBS), Lionsgate (LGF), and Discovery Communications (DISCA). The decision is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media firms by telecom giants. The deal also bodes well for big vertical health care mergers, including CVS Health (CVS) buying Aetna (AET).Comcast (CMSCA), as expected, launched a takeover bid for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), offering $65 billion in cash for Rupert Murdoch's entertainment company, a 19% premium over the Walt Disney (DIS) offer. Disney in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in broadcaster Sky — for $54.4 billion in stock. Fox's board is expected to withdraw its recommendation for Disney's offer. The companies are unlikely to carve up Fox, analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

EA and Activision cleared buy zones while Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) broke out.The Fed hiked its key interest rate, as expected, for the second time this year. Somewhat surprisingly, policymakers penciled in two more hikes this year. Chairman Jerome Powell declared the economy to be in ""great shape,"" and expressed no sense that the a hawkish shift in policy would be any risk.May retail sales rose 0.8%, their best gain in six months, backing up Powell's assessment. That spurred some Wall Street firms to boost second-quarter GDP growth projections to 4% or more.

744,KEY,"Learning how to read stock charts helps you get in early on winning stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Netflix (NFLX). Charts also help you spot the right time to sell and take your profits.In part 1 of this series on chart reading for beginners, we answered two basic questions: Why use charts? What's in a stock chart?In this second installment, we'll go over three telltale clues to look for in a stock chart to help you know when it's time to buy, sell or hold. Once you know how to spot these signals and understand the concepts behind them, you'll be ready to capture solid gains with the three most profitable chart patterns.TIP: Watch our free Stock Charts Decoded webinar for an overview of how to read stock charts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's easy to overcomplicate chart reading. But as we saw in part 1 of this series, charts simply tell you a story. And to understand what tale is being told, you really just need to answer the three basic questions discussed below.So keep it simple. You'll be surprised by how much you can learn about the health and potential of a stock just from these three clues.Editor's Note: If you come across terms or concepts you're not familiar with, check out part 1 of this series for more details.The first question to ask when looking at a stock chart is, ""What's the trend?"" There are basically three possibilities: uptrend, sideways, downtrend.As simple as that concept may sound, it's also quite important. You want to buy stocks when they're going in the right direction — up.Why buy a stock that is clearly heading south? Yes, it may eventually find a bottom and reverse that trend. But why jump in when it's headed the wrong way? Wait until it shows clear signs of renewed strength and begins moving in the right direction.When a stock is moving sideways, there's no clearly defined trend. You don't know if the stock will jump higher or take a nosedive. Again, why take the risk at this stage? You're better off waiting for the stock to show signs of a new uptrend.Charts tell a story. They show you if a stock is being heavily bought or aggressively sold by large investors. But the only way to decipher that story is to look at the changes in share price together with the changes in volume (i.e., the number of shares traded that day or week).Share prices fluctuate daily, up or down. To see if the buying or selling is serious — and to see if the underlying trend is changing — you need to check the volume.For example, say a stock normally trades 1 million shares a day. If the share price rises or falls a bit one day and volume is around 1 million shares, that's nothing unusual. But if the stock suddenly trades 3 million shares one day as it gains 5%, you know something is up. You want to pay particular attention to those kinds of unusually heavy-volume days or weeks.Let's look at some different scenarios and what they mean.Price GAIN In Unusually Heavy Volume: Look at the weekly chart for Netflix below. The video streaming giant's share price has been rising sharply since the end of 2016. And as indicated by the arrows in the chart, there were several weeks where Netflix's share price rose sharply and volume also spiked.What story does such behavior reveal? That mutual fund managers and other large investors are aggressively scooping up shares. This so-called ""institutional demand"" is exactly what you want to see, since it's these large investors that provide the fuel a stock needs to make a sustained climb.Nvidia, which rose over 650% after being highlighted in the IBD 50, offers another example of strong institutional demand. In the daily chart below, look how the stock was trading in a tight range right along its 50-day line in April and May of 2017 (1). The stock then gapped up on May 10 in volume 268% higher than normal (2). And note how volume continued to come in well above average as the stock moved higher in the days that followed (3). Large investors were clearly in buying mode. The stock spiked again in heavy volume on June (4).Price DROP In Unusually Heavy Volume: This is the exact opposite of the scenario above. A large drop in price accompanied by a big spike in volume shows large investors are aggressively dumping shares. In other words, the selling is serious. As the example of 3D printing stock 3D Systems (DDD) shows below, it's especially worrisome if the stock is crashing below the 50-day or 10-week moving average line when that happens.Look how volume rose sharply as the stock crashed right through its 50-day line (1). And the same thing happened as the stock failed to find support at the 200-day line (2). These were both signs that after a big run prior to 2014, 3D Systems' trend had changed.Price GAIN In Unusually Light Volume: If the share price is rising significantly, but volume is normal or below average, what does that tell you? That, at least for now, large investors are not buying aggressively. In other words, there's not a lot of conviction for the move.Such moves can turn out to be a head fake, which was the case for Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) in the chart below. The stock broke out from a base, but volume was well below average (1). On the day of a breakout, you want to see a 40% or larger spike in earnings to show strong demand. Old Dominion fell well short of that.In the days that followed, note how volume rose sharply as the stock fell (2, 3). So a light-volume breakout attempt turned into a heavy-volume sell-off. Such behavior is a clear sign that large investors are in selling, not buying, mode.Price DROP In Unusually Light Volume: When a stock falls but the number of shares traded is much lower than normal, it tells you large investors are not selling aggressively. This is an important clue that can help you sit tight and hold on for bigger gains down the road.The example of Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) below proves that point. While Ollie's was building a new flat base, note how volume on down weeks was below average (1). It was also finding support at the 10-week line. As the arrows in the chart indicate, the stock broke out of that base in heavy volume and showed several heavy-volume up weeks as the stock climbed higher for months. It's a clear example of how you can see what fund managers are up to by looking for unusual spikes in price and volume in a stock chart.Last but not least, see if your stock is finding support or running into resistance at key lines like the 50-day and 10-week moving averages. Also look for support or resistance at important price areas, such as new or recent buy points in a chart pattern.How your stock performs at these testing grounds reveals a great deal about its strength. Why? Because many fund managers and other large investors closely follow these benchmarks.If these big players still favor the stock, they'll often step in to pick up more shares and protect their positions when it pulls back to the 50-day or 10-week line. Their buying will keep the stock above those benchmarks. But if the stock crashes below the moving average in heavy volume, it's a sign that large investors have shifted into selling mode.Take Alarm.com (ALRM) as an example. As it was making a nice run in 2017, the stock consistently found support at its 10-week moving average (1, 2, 3). It was in a clear uptrend, and there were several heavy-volume up weeks — a sign of institutional demand.But note how that trend changed toward the end of that year. The stock failed to find support at the 10-week line and crashed below it in heavy volume (4). After that, note how the 10-week moving average changed from an area of support to a line of resistance (5, 6).Lines Of Defense: You can think of the 50-day and 200-day moving average lines as a stock's first and second lines of defense. (On a weekly chart, the equivalents are the 10-week and 40-week moving averages.) If a stock fails to find support at the 50-day line, see if it can at least hold its ground at the 200-day moving average. In the case of 3D Systems discussed earlier, you can see how the stock failed to find support at either benchmark, and crashed below both of them in heavy volume (1 and 2, above).Steppingstones: E-Trade Financial (ETFC) shows how stocks will often form steppingstones as they climb higher. This happens as the stock hits resistance (1) and pulls back, then finds support (2) and rises again. It's very healthy action to see a stock turn a former ceiling of resistance into a new floor of support.In the next installment of this series on chart reading for beginners, we'll go over the three most profitable chart patterns: cup with handle, double bottom and flat base.As we do that, you'll see how each of the three telltale clues discussed above come into play:You can also learn more with our free lessons on how to read stock charts.

746,KEY,"Decade after decade, new bull markets serve up big, new market leaders. Excellent fundamentals and increasing mutual fund ownership are two main catalysts for huge gains for select stocks. But all good runs eventually come to an end. It's true in sports and it's true in politics, but it's especially true in the stock market.What causes a stock's run to end? By and large, it's institutional selling — when fund managers decide to liquidate large positions and take profits after a big price run.So after a stock's lengthy run-up, it's always important to watch for signs of heavy institutional selling.For a market leader, the 50-day moving average, which computes a running average of price closes over the past 50 trading sessions, can act as a support level during an uptrend. But it can also act as a resistance level during a downtrend.If a stock breaks below the 50-day line (drawn in red in all IBD charts and in MarketSmith) in heavy volume and can't rally back, it's often a signal that buying demand is drying up and the stock's run is ending. Keep in mind that one or two bursts of institutional selling can often presage more sales ahead. Sometimes, it can take a fund several weeks to exit a position.Studying the price action of former market leaders just before they broke down can help you act quickly when a current leader you own starts to falter.After a huge breakout in April 2003, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) rode its 50-day line higher to a monster gain. Its price action wasn't a fluke. Big funds were accumulating the stock in anticipation of continued strong demand for Deckers' Ugg boots.After an initial breakout below 10, Deckers eventually stormed to an all-time high near 25 in January 2004. It also cleared a series of bases before topping out at 49.12 in late December 2004.In January 2005, the first signs of institutional selling started to appear. Big percentage declines in heavy volume are a telltale sign that institutions are unloading.On Jan. 6, Deckers fell 7% and dropped below its 50-day line in volume 170% higher than average (1). Two days later, it tried to reclaim the line but reversed in big volume (2). It was time to sell.In February, Deckers was repeatedly turned away at the 50-day line. Clearly, buying demand was drying up.Finally, it staged a spectacular reversal on Feb. 24 (3), yet another sign of institutional selling. By April, the stock lost nearly 58% of its value.IBD'S TAKE: In some cases, a great stock will punctuate the end of a rally with multiple sell signals, covered frequently in IBD's Investor's Corner and daily market columns.

747,KEY,"As Tesla (TSLA), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) accelerate electric vehicle production, Brazilian mining giant Vale (VALE) will invest roughly $1.54 billion to launch underground nickel mining operations in Canada to meet booming demand for minerals used in EV batteries.XVale's Voisey's Bay nickel move came as that project was nearing the end of its open-pit life, Bloomberg said. The bet on underground mining will extend the life of the mine by 15 years and create 1,700 direct jobs. Construction is likely to start this summer, with operations kicking off in April 2021.The move was also seen as a signal that Vale is bullish on nickel again. According to Reuters, Vale OK'd the underground mine in 2015, but slowed down plans last year on weak nickel prices and a major review of the company's assets.The Voisey's Bay complex mostly churns out nickel but also has cobalt, another critical EV battery metal that has seen its price jump recently.On Friday, sources told Bloomberg that Vale reached a $700 million deal to sell cobalt output from Voisey's Bay. Vale declined to comment.Cobalt, a metal that is typically produced as a byproduct of copper and nickel mining, extends battery life.Shares of Vale dipped 0.4% at 13.70 in today's stock market action. Rio Tinto (RIO), another miner poised to benefit from soaring demand for electric vehicle (EV) batteries, fell 0.1%. Lithium producer Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) lost 0.2%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), which has partners with other miner to operate a cobalt refinery in Finland, advanced 0.9%.Tesla jumped 4.55% Monday, reclaiming its 200-day moving average as it continues a recent rebound. GM and Honda Motor (HMC), which last week announced an EV battery pact with GM, rose 1.4% and 1.6% respectively. Fiat Chrysler gained 0.7% and Ford fell 0.5%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAccording to automotive industry forecasts, EVs will take a 40%-50% share of the global auto market by 2040, up from around 3% today, with China leading that momentum.As a result, carmakers including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler have laid out staggering targets for EV production, sales and investments.Improving Model 3 production also bodes well for battery materials demand from Tesla, a top EV manufacturer. Tesla also plans to mass produce batteries at its gigafactory and has been trying to secure supplies of key ingredients like lithium.But China has emerged as a dominant force in the scramble for EV battery metals, reaching deals to secure supplies.In May, a Chinese lithium producer bought a 24% stake in Chile's SQM. That followed a deal between SQM and Chilean authorities earlier this year, clearing the way for SQM to expand lithium production.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:As Electric Car Use Grows, These Chipmakers Are In The Driver's SeatSelf-Driving Cars: Why 2018 Will Be The Year The Rubber Hits The RoadHow To Make Electric Vehicles Profitable As Tesla, GM Look To Build Millions

748,KEY,"Utility stocks ran at the top and the bottom of the S&P 500 in an unusual session Monday. Sempra Energy (SRE) soared 15%, spurred by interest from activist hedge fund Elliott Management. PG&E (PCG) tanked almost 5% on liability concerns related to last year's Northern California wildfires.Both are diversified utilities, dealing with both power generation and natural gas. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit Stock Market Today.)Only one other utility stock in the 34-stock diversified industry group, Allete (ALE), moved more than 2%. Duluth, Minn.-based Allete dropped 2.5%. The result left the overall Utility-Diversified group up 0.4% for the day.A letter from Paul Singer's Elliott Management to Sempra's board outlined changes that the activist investor would like to see in order for the company to unlock investor value. Those changes included replacing six board members, as well as launching a strategic review of operations and assets.Elliott Management is a hedge fund with $34 billion in assets under management. The fund had played a key role in guiding Sempra, based in San Diego, to pay $9.45 billion to acquire Energy Futures Holdings. EFH held an 80% stake in Dallas-based power producer Oncor.At the time of the sale, Oncor reported more than 11 million customers. That lifted Sempra's total to more than 43 million. Elliott Associates, Elliott International and partner Bluescape Resources reportedly hold a 4.9% stake in Sempra. The letter to Sempra estimates that the utility can unlock between $11 billion and $16 billion in value. That would translate roughly to a $139 to $159 per share boost to the utility stock.In San Francisco, PG&E said Monday that it anticipates a ""significant liability"" after a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection report released Friday found PG&E equipment had caused at least 12 of the 24 blazes that tore through California's wine country in October. The fires killed 44 people and caused an estimated $10 billion in damage.The state is still investigating the Tubbs Fire. The largest fire in California's history, Tubbs was part of the overall October conflagration, responsible for 24 deaths. PG&E claims that fire was started by a power line installed and owned by a private property owner.Uncertainty over liabilities led PG&E to suspend its dividend in December. On Monday, Wells Fargo kept its market perform rating on the stock, and lowered the price target to 46, from 48. Investment research firm CFRA carved its price target to 36, from 46, and downgraded the stock to strong sell, from hold.PG&E dived more than 8% in opening trade, then eased to a 4% loss.

752,KEY,"The economy is surging as the jobless rate has plunged near a 50-year low, and five more Fed rate hikes are cued up over the next 18 months — including one at Wednesday's Fed meeting.Yet something about this show of economic strength doesn't quite add up. Even as firming inflation and Fed rate-hike expectations have pushed up short-term government bond yields, the flattening yield curve is signaling growing doubts about the durability of the economy's momentum.Wall Street economists are split as to whether the Fed will hike once or twice more this year after Wednesday. If Fed economic projections released with their policy statement on Wednesday point to a likelihood of just one, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite are expected to rally, as Treasury yields pull back.Yet there's a big question about how long any relief rally can run when the Fed's footsteps seem to be closing in.On Tuesday, the 2-year Treasury yield rose to 2.54%, closing to within 42 basis points of the 2.96% 10-year Treasury yield. That's within a whisker of the narrowest yield gap (41 basis points) since 2007, when long-term rates fell below short-term rates, a reliable precursor of recession.In other words, a Fed that bucks up stock market investors with its display of patience still may not be patient enough.The flat yield curve helps explain why both homebuilders, which thrive on low interest rates, and banks, which can benefit from rising rates, are among the market's biggest laggards. The Building-Residential/Commercial group is ranked No. 186 of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD based on stock performance, while the Banks-Money Center group is a lowly 171.On Tuesday, shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) slipped below their 50-day moving averages. Meanwhile, CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon said KB Home (KBH) and Toll Bros. (TOL) could struggle amid a less-than-stellar spring selling season for homebuilders.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Fed, under new chair Jerome Powell, faces an unprecedented policy challenge. Fiscal stimulus has always been ordered up during a recession or at the start of a recovery. This time, President Trump and Congress are delivering a double dose of major tax cuts and spending hikes deep into the expansion, when growth was already firm and labor markets tight. Now it's hitting as core inflation has finally accelerated close to the Fed's 2% target.Keep in mind that last summer, before Trump's tax-cut push gathered steam, markets were pricing in a single rate hike over the ensuing 12 months. The challenge is that policy works with a time lag. So almost as soon as the Fed adjusts policy to respond to economic strength, stimulus will be fading.""We are clearly more concerned than the Fed"" about the economic outlook for 2019, wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank, when policymakers released their projections in March. ""As the impact of the (tax cut and spending) stimuli fades, growth rates should begin to slow perceptibly around the middle of the year, before slowing further into 2020.""The potentially good news is that Fed policymakers have taken note of the flattening yield curve and plan to exercise caution so that the curve doesn't invert, with longer rates slipping below short-term rates. Even still, getting the timing right won't be simple.""2019 is setting up to be a dangerous year, as the fiscal stimulus rolls off while the impact of the Fed's tightening will be peaking,"" Greg Jensen, co-chief investment officer of hedge fund behemoth Bridgewater Associates, wrote recently.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:AT&T Can Buy Time Warner; Court Ruling To Ignite Comcast, Disney BrawlIBD Stock Of The Day: Hot New China IPO iQiyi Flashes This Key Technical Sign3 Top Stocks Near Buy Zones; Time To Take Profits In Twitter?Why This Biotech Company Is Bounding Closer To A BreakoutChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

755,KEY,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) toppled Tuesday afternoon on news European officials may reject a patent covering key blockbuster drug Soliris, an analyst said.On the stock market today, Alexion tumbled 2.9% to close at 114.95. The stock dipped as much as 5%. Still, shares are consolidating with a buy point at 149.44. Broadly, biotech stocks added a fraction.The European Patent Office issued a negative preliminary opinion on a patent protecting Soliris, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said. The office set oral arguments for February. Then, officials will make an official decision to uphold or reject the patent.""We do caveat that language in the preliminary opinion indicates that rejection appears to be expected as a base case scenario,"" he said in a note. Further, paperwork published in November showed a similar opinion by an examiner in Europe.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMacKay added: ""As such, today's preliminary opinion by the EPO should not come as a surprise in our view.""The company responded to the news in a written statement: ""Alexion is confident in the strength of the application. In addition, the company has both granted and pending patents for Soliris in Europe that could provide protection into 2027.""Alexion has patents protecting Soliris in Europe through 2020, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. It also has orphan drug exclusivity with expirations in 2019, 2023 and 2027 for the three diseases Soliris treats.Physicians use Soliris to treat two blood diseases and a neuromuscular disease. But the firm is also working on a next-generation version of the drug called ALXN1210. ALXN1210 is in advanced development in both blood diseases and in early development for the third condition.Both MacKay and Porges don't expect Alexion to maintain Soliris' exclusivity in Europe through the late 2020s. To protect its franchise, Alexion will have to successfully switch applicable Soliris patients over to ALXN1210.It's possible Alexion could face a biologic copycat of Soliris in Europe in 2023. But that would just be in the two blood diseases. If that happens, Alexion's product sales will be 6%-9% lower than he currently expects, and roughly flat from 2024-28, Porges said in a note.""If Alexion is able to convert more than 50% of their installed base of (Soliris) patients in these markets to (ALXN1210) by 2022, then the value effect is likely to be even lower,"" he said.RBC's MacKay already has Soliris loss of exclusivity in Europe built into his model. He views the likelihood of Alexion extending exclusivity into 2027 ""conservatively."" Amgen (AMGN) is working on a Soliris biosimilar. He expects a biologic copycat of Soliris in Europe in 2021.""This is balanced by the franchise protection that we see being provided by successful switching of current Soliris-treated patients to ALXN1210,"" he said. ""Therefore, we have and continue to view any potential delays to biosimilar entry from Alexion's success with the EPO as upside.""RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichLooking For The Next Nvidia?

761,KEY,"Top-rated retailer Ross Stores (ROST) as well as IBD 50 names Twitter (TWTR), TAL Education (TAL) and Momo (MOMO), scored new highs Friday. The latter three are well-extended past proper buy points.But Ross Stores is still in buy range from its handle entry at 84.67. Ross flashed a sell signal from a prior 82.91 entry when it fell 7.8% below the buy point. A key IBD sell rule says to always cut losses at 7% or 8% from your purchase price. Sometimes, a loss can be cut sooner than that.Despite a strong move for the stock in the past 10 years, Ross's latest breakout is still early stage, because the stock reset its base count when it made a big consolidation last year. The low undercut the low of the prior base, shaking enough sellers out to reset the base count. The breakout on Nov. 17 was first stage.Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) also made the new highs list. The stock looks poised for its third straight gain Friday. It cleared a 105.14 buy point Wednesday in higher volume. It's still within the 5% buy zone, although the market faces some risk.As of Thursday's close, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed five distribution days each. Meaningful losses for the major stock indexes in higher volume are a sign of institutional selling. The number of distribution days should always be monitored closely when the market is in a confirmed uptrend — like now.The financial sector also delivered some new highs. Small-cap Cadence Bancorp (CADE) popped above a 30.60 buy point Friday. It's plenty liquid with an average daily volume of more than 1 million shares.

782,KEY,"America's worst drug epidemic shifted into high gear ten years ago when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned fatal drug overdoses in 2008 were poised to overtake the numbers of deaths caused by motor vehicle crashes.XToday, the most recent data show over 42,000 annual deaths caused by opioid abuse, which surpasses the mortality rate of car accidents by several thousand.How is it that car crash fatalities peaked at over 51,000 in 1979 and in recent years are less than 40,000 despite more drivers?  Innovations such as airbags and three-point seatbelts among other technologies engineered into modern vehicles account for life-saving improvements in automotive safety.Yet we have relatively few visible signs of similar advances in treating pain, which is what caused this drug epidemic.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe CDC states the opioid crisis began in the 1990's with increasing prescriptions.  The health care system mistakenly accepted that powerful opioids could safely treat virtually anything that hurt in the human body. Making matters worse, a wildly successful marketing campaign, later proven to be fraudulent, promoted an opioid prescription ""pain-killer"" drug as non-addictive.Around the same time stakeholder interests aligned to promote pain as a vital sign equating its importance with pulse, breathing and blood pressure.  The question now becomes what we learned from the 1990's and how to successfully manage our way out of this crisis.What might seem like an easy solution — suddenly yanking someone off opioids and cutting off supply will not work.  Untreated, severe chronic pain decimates quality of life so policymakers and insurers must understand that imposing dosage amounts, limiting prescriptions and refusing reimbursement has unintended consequences, most notably inducing some to turn to illegal heroin and fentanyl.Addiction must be addressed with a specific, long-term plan. Although there is widespread consensus on reducing opioid prescriptions overall, the challenge is doing so in a manner that respects individuals.  A physician-led, patient empowered experience is essential to properly managing pain and the opioid crisis itself.  This is easier said than done.America's health care system mostly clings to a tactical 'fix-it' approach, addressing short-term needs with a particular medical intervention.  Physicians aggravate this situation by not spending enough time with patients, an unfortunate result of a complex health care system that imposes onerous administrative burdens on medical providers.Nevertheless, we should view the patient as a customer who is in charge of deciding the services they consider most appropriate.  While we have the technology and tools to link patients with their doctors, we're simply not using them enough.For example, it is standard practice for patients to keep a written diary of chronic pain to review with their doctors.  Intended to pinpoint where it hurts and analyze the effectiveness of pain medications including widely-prescribed opioids such as Oxycontin, Percocet and Vicodin, these journals are merely hand-written paper notes. Analog notes can't be readily shared or analyzed and are prone to error.The technology exists for patients to record and share data real-time on smart phones.  By analyzing data over time, physicians and patients may conclude that opioid drugs are not always as effective as alternatives to alleviating pain, as numerous clinical trials have shown.Three out of four Americans fail to take medication as directed.  Mobile applications enable patients to enter their prescriptions, set up reminders, track quantities and log dosage amounts.  ""Smart"" pill bottles prevent diversion and monitor use. Syncing patients and their doctors with these tools makes it easier to use pain medications as directed.Moreover, physicians can get real-time visibility into patient behavior.A natural outcome of physician-led, patient empowerment will lead to greater understanding of multiple ways to treat pain.  Interventional pain management techniques are usually out-patient procedures focusing on internal parts of the body generating pain.Information and access to non-opioid medical therapies including acetaminophen, the key ingredient in Tylenol, local anesthetics, and other classes of drugs should be available to consumers on their own, personalized applications.Proven, viable options to treat pain include non-drug treatments like exercise, physical therapy, yoga, acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy.  And supervised opioid therapy, managed closely by providers aided by mobile health technology, will limit dependence and addiction for those patients where these drugs are most effective.""Check with your doctor,"" a familiar legal disclaimer which applies in medical decisions, will take on added significance when we embrace the latest technologies to facilitate better communications between physicians and patients.  It is time to ""buckle up.""Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

785,KEY,"It was Jan. 17, 1991. America was at war in Iraq. The mission: Operation Desert Storm. Lockheed's F-117 Nighthawk, the first stealth fighter, showcased America's superior air power to Saddam Hussein and the rest of the world.The unconventionally shaped stealth plane would make 1,300 sorties, hitting 1,600 high-value targets during the campaign. It accounted for 40% of all targeted damage, without a single hit by enemy fire.Stealth played a key role in the military's second offset strategy, where a small number of high-tech platforms could beat the massive military hardware the Soviets boasted. Stealth marked a new era in air warfare and is a foundation of U.S. air supremacy to this day.But the game-changing F-117 wouldn't have been possible without Ben Rich, the second director of Lockheed's secretive Skunk Works, who took a major risk despite the discouragement of some of the brightest minds in aerospace.Rich was born on June 18, 1925, in Manila, Philippines, to a British hardwood lumber mill superintendent and a French linguist.As tensions rose in the Pacific, his family moved to Los Angeles just months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. There he went to work with his father in a machine shop to help support the family during the war years. His shelved his dream to go to college to become a doctor.At 21 Rich was finally able to attend college. He graduated in 1949 with a mechanical engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley. He later received a master's degree in aerothermodynamics from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he met his first wife, Faye.The postwar recession made jobs scarce. But Rich managed to find an engineering job at Lockheed (LMT) in 1950. Because he wasn't earning enough to support his growing family, he gave notice after just four years of employment. He was all set to take over his father-in-law's bakery-delicatessen. At the last second, Rich changed his mind. Truth was, he liked building airplanes better than selling deli meats.Soon after deciding to stay at Lockheed, he joined Skunk Works at the request of founder Kelly Johnson.Skunk Works, formally called the Advanced Development Programs, is Lockheed's legendary research and development lab. Created in 1943 to develop the company's top-secret technology during World War II, it was the birthplace of the P-38 fighter. Employees at the secretive unit refer to themselves as ""Skunks.""The division started in a circus tent outside the main Lockheed building in Burbank, next to a smelly plastics factory. Their unique moniker comes from a stinky concoction make by a bootlegger in the ""Li'l Abner"" comic strip.Under Johnson, Rich worked on the highflying U-2 spy plane, which the Air Force plans to keep flying for more than 100 years.He also designed the air-inlet control system for the SR-71 Blackbird, which can fly three times the speed of sound. In his autobiography, ""Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed,"" Rich called his contribution to the SR-71 the most ""exhausting, difficult and nerve-wracking work"" of his career.Rich won the American Institution of Aeronautics and Astronautics Award in 1972 for the Blackbird's propulsion system. His work on the F-117 would win Rich aerospace's top award, the prestigious Collier Trophy, in 1989. Kelly Johnson tapped Rich as his replacement in 1975. Rich was a popular choice. Most of the Skunks chose to stay during the major transition.""Tip your hat to someone like Ben keeping an operation going after such a strong leader like Kelly,"" said Larry Pellett, the current director of major projects at Skunk Works. Rich asked Pellett to join Skunk Works after seeing him give a presentation in 1989.Johnson was an autocratic leader. He was very hands-on with his technical workers. He reworked submitted designs, striking fear into some of the younger employees. But Pellett said Rich's success resided in the fact that he never tried to be like Johnson. Instead he adopted his own managerial style.""There is a joke among Skunks that Kelly managed with his bad temper, and Ben managed with bad jokes,"" Pellett said. ""He was the cheerleader, the facilitator that built the team up.""Other employees felt the same way about Rich's brand of leadership.""Ben kept a close eye on all our problems, but he was never a second-guesser,"" Alan Brown, Rich's program manager, said in Rich's autobiography. ""Rich let us do our thing and smooth our way with the Air Force and Lockheed management.""Rich took the reins during a tumultuous time for Lockheed. Spending on the unpopular Vietnam War was winding down. And the company found itself in the midst of a bribery scandal.To add to the company's woes, Lockheed hadn't won a fighter contract since the F-104 Starfighter, built during the Korean War. But a major breakthrough was on the horizon.The aviation community considers Rich the father of stealth. But the idea came from an unlikely source. Pyotr Ufimtsev, a Soviet scientist, theorized about stealth technology in a 1962 paper called ""Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction."" The paper outlined equations on how to calculate radar cross-sections, an object's ability to reflect radar. But the Soviets deemed the paper impractical and of little use. Ufimstev's discovery would have stayed buried in a Soviet library, if not for Rich.Denys Overholser, a radar specialist, brought the research paper to Rich just six months after Rich took the helm at the Skunk Works. Overholser suggested the company use the equations to build their own stealth plane that could evade the Soviet Union's radar.""I take credit for immediately recognizing the value of the gift I was handed before it became apparent to everyone else, and for taking major risks in expanding development costs before we had any real government interest or commitment,"" Rich said in his autobiography.The result was a model made from a series of flat surfaces that looked like a cut diamond. It was nicknamed ""Rich's Folly"" and ""Hopeless Diamond,"" among other things. The oddly shaped plane is now sometimes compared to a flying Darth Vader.Despite having a working model, Lockheed hadn't been invited to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) competition to build a stealthy plane. All development contract money had been awarded by the time Rich heard of the contest.Rich convinced DARPA head George Heilmeier to let Lockheed join the competition. Rich also smartly rejected DARPA's pro forma $1 offer. Instead he submitted his proposal for free, ensuring the technology would remain the property of Lockheed.Never straying too far from Skunk Works, Johnson caught wind of the stealth plane. He furiously told Rich to shut down development. Johnson erroneously believed missiles were the future of warfare. The ugly, flat-paneled airplane would never fly, he thought.Larry Kitchen, Lockheed's president at the time, was also a skeptic. He said the company needed ""real projects, not pipe dreams,"" Rich recalled in his autobiography.But Rich persevered despite the naysayers. He believed in the game-changing technology. Rich spent nearly 1 million dollars of Skunk Works' development cash on the stealth project. He envisioned huge military and financial returns in the future.""I never wavered from believing that stealth could create the biggest Skunk Works bonanza ever,"" Rich wrote.Despite being shut out of the DARPA competition at first, ""Rich's Folly"" eventually beat Northrop's submission. After two successful experimental prototypes, built quickly from off-the-shelf items at Skunk Works, the F-117 program was born.But while Rich was about to make a major military breakthrough, he suffered a major personal loss. His wife Faye passed away in 1980. Rich pressed on in his work to manage his grief.The F-117 first flew in 1981 and entered service in 1983. Kept in the dark, the plane wouldn't see its first mission until 1989 in Panama. It wouldn't become an international sensation until the Gulf War. And as the first F-117s took to the skies over Iraq in 1991, Rich and his Skunks celebrated his retirement.Rich had some setbacks during his time at the Skunk Works. Lockheed lost out on the B-2 bomber contract to Northrop (NOC) because he refused to overpromise on price and capabilities. The B-2 would become a casualty of a ""death spiral,"" where decreased military spending by Washington led to less planes being purchased, leading to a higher cost per plane. The B-2 would eventually go on to cost billions of dollars more than first budgeted as Congress kept cutting the number of planes ordered.""I never lied to a customer or tried to dodge the heat when we screwed up,"" he wrote. ""I knew how other companies operated, and I was convinced that our reputation for integrity would gain more business than we would ever lose by turning away questionable ventures. And I was right.""Rich died of cancer on Jan. 5, 1995, but his legacy lives on at Skunk Works. Stealth brought Lockheed back into the fighter jet business. The company built the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. The latter accounts for a quarter of Lockheed Martin's yearly revenue.Following Rich's belief in the need to find the next revolutionary advancement, Skunk Works is developing the next disruptive technologies, from hypersonics to artificial intelligence, in an effort to stay ahead of growing advances by U.S. adversaries like Russia and China.Engineer who believed stealth technology would be a game-changer on the battlefieldOvercame: Skepticism and the shadow of his revered mentor.Lesson: Recognized the power of a new technology and stuck to his project despite doubts from respected members in his field.""I was convinced that our reputation for integrity would gain more business than we would ever lose by turning away questionable ventures.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

BP doesn't have as many shale assets as other oil majors. BP sold most of its shale acreage in 2010 to pay for damages related to the Deepwater Horizon disaster.But BHP's timing for the asset sale comes as interest in the Permian slows amid an increase in pipeline bottlenecks that have made getting shale oil to key destinations more difficult.""It's going to be a lot harder to sell Permian assets than a year ago. Investors are realizing that other basins are viable,"" Ghulam said.Pipeline capacity from the basin hasn't kept up with increased production, and Ghulam expects the bottlenecks to last for another two years unless more pipelines come on line.If BHP's assets were sold in one piece as the company wants, Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones, believes BP or Shell would be the most likely buyers.""BP had to sell off some of its shale positions to pay for oil spill. Shell historically hasn't a big portfolio in shale.""But if BHP splits up the asset sales, Youngberg said Chevron would be most likely to buy the Permian acreage as it already has a large footprint in the play.He said the natural gas focused Fayetteville and Haynesville basins would likely go to a hedge fund as they would be more willing to accept weaker natural gas pricing.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under WaterOil Stocks And Industry News

800,KEY,"The White House said it will tee up tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports by June 15, enabling President Donald Trump to swing away shortly thereafter. So is a Trump trade war with China back on?Various news reports gave that impression, even though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the trade war was ""on hold"" barely over a week ago. Yet it's a premature conclusion — at best — that the White House is back on a China trade war footing.President Trump has acknowledged some misgivings with the tentative deal for China to buy more U.S. energy and agricultural goods. Yet he continued to strike a mostly conciliatory tone for the past six weeks. That includes Trump's agreement to lift the effective death sentence for ZTE, the Chinese telecom equipment giant that's been unable to buy key components due to stiff U.S. sanctions.Trump may be taking a softer line with China to facilitate nuclear diplomacy with North Korea.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo why release news that plans for 25% tariffs on Chinese imports are advancing? Most likely, the Trump administration is letting the wheels of the bureaucracy keep spinning while negotiations proceed with China.That benign explanation seems to make the most sense and seems consistent with Wall Street's reaction. While the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 both fell broadly Tuesday on Italy concerns, potential victims of a trade war with China weren't notably weak. Deere (DE), whose fortunes are heavily tied to U.S. agriculture, slipped 2.3%, barely cutting into its big monthlong rally. Meanwhile, Caterpillar (CAT) lost 1.4%, not much worse than the broad S&P 500. Boeing (BA) was off just 2.1%. Caterpillar and Boeing are Dow Jones stocks.Yet even if a tit-for-tat tariff fight doesn't break out, trade tensions are likely to keep building with China and could explode at any time.

802,KEY,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is getting some breathing room, an analyst said Thursday, as rival Proteostasis (PTI) tumbled on disappointing results from a study testing cystic fibrosis drugs.Proteostasis tested its drug, PTI-801, in patients also taking Vertex's drug Orkambi. The regimen showed improvements in blood glucose, sweat chloride — an indicator of cystic fibrosis — and weight gain. But patients didn't experience a major improvement in their breathing.It's ""not as easy as it looks,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note. Vertex shares have dipped 10% quarter to date on competitive worries. But the ""sell-off can reverse after competitive threats fade,"" he said.Vertex rose as much as 2.5% intraday, but ended the regular session down a fraction to 145.75. Shares of Proteostasis crashed 38% to 3.03 on the stock market today. Galapagos (GLPG), another rival, saw its shares lose 2.5% to 102.67 on Proteostasis' news.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA number of cystic fibrosis drugs work to correct malfunctioning protein made by the CFTR gene. PTI-801 is what's known as a CFTR corrector. Vertex has a portfolio of correctors that work in different patients based on their own genetic mutations.Vertex, Proteostasis and Galapagos with partner AbbVie (ABBV) are all working on combinations of drugs to treat cystic fibrosis. The study from Proteostasis was looking to determine the best doses of PTI-801 for double- and triple-pill studies, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said.The key metric these tests look to improve is forced expiratory volume for one second. In Proteostasis' study, the best result came from a 200-milligram dose of PTI-801 on top of Orkambi. That improved forced expiratory volume for one second by 2.5 percentage points.But that lagged Vertex's newly approved drug Symdeko — a two-medicine regimen — which improves patients' ability to forcefully expel air by 10% to 11%, Leerink's Porges said. Now, Proteostasis' competitive threat ""appears modest,"" he said""While Proteostasis' corrector binds to a different site on the CFTR protein than Vertex's medicines, the failure to match the high (effectiveness) bar established by Vertex is a testament to the difficult development path for competitors with small molecule therapies for cystic fibrosis,"" he said.Galapagos will likely have data later this month for a study of its second-generation corrector on top of Orkambi.The results from Proteostasis ""suggest that the medicinal chemistry at Vertex may indeed be a durable competitive advantage for the company in the cystic fibrosis indication,"" he said. But if Galapagos is successful, Vertex could ""retrace back to the 160-170 range through June and July.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

803,KEY,"The IBD Stock of the Day is Akamai Technologies (AKAM), which is hovering just below a buy point. Akamai is nearing the potential entry just after cloud services rival Amazon (AMZN) moved into its own buy zone last week.The cloud-based internet content delivery provider is trading just below a cup-with-handle buy point of 77.69. The stock first tried to clear that level on May 22, but hit resistance and reversed lower.The buy point for Akamai Technologies, which is in IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, remains valid because the stock only fell as much as 3.5% from that level. A sell signal for the stock would be triggered at a 7%-8% loss.Shares rose 1.4% to 77.07 in Monday's stock market trading.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Amazon stock cleared a buy point of 1,617.54 on Wednesday. It eclipsed the old peak of 1,638.10 on Thursday, offering another entry point. Both moves came in light volume. Amazon climbed 1.45% Monday to 1,665.27, a new high.Akamai's key customers include software stocks Salesforce (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK), as well as online brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).If and when Akamai attempts a breakout, look for heavy volume on the upside as that indicates support from institutional investors. Also keep an eye out for an upward-sloping relative strength line, which measures a stock's price performance vs. that of the S&P 500. Right now the RS line is trading somewhat sideways. An RS line at a new high during a breakout is a bullish indicator.This base has a handle. When a stock forms a handle on a cup base, that's a positive development.

The Composite Rating includes a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity, and relative price performance.Last quarter, the company broke a streak of quarterly earnings declines, with growth of 22%. Akamai also saw its second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. The tech firm is expected to issue its next quarterly report near the end of June.The Internet-Network Solutions industry group ranks No. 35 out of the 197 industries IBD tracks.

805,KEY,"A day after a tentative agreement to overhaul U.S. biofuel policy appeared to collapse amid farm-state concerns, EPA chief Scott Pruitt met to discuss the issue with the lead senator pushing for the changes: Ted Cruz.Pruitt had dinner with Cruz, a Texas Republican, at a Washington steakhouse blocks from the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday night.Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, declined to comment on the meeting as he left the restaurant, but Cruz said the dinner included discussion about the Renewable Fuel Standard and had been planned well before Monday's reports that a White House-brokered accord was unraveling. Cruz stressed that a deal to overhaul the biofuel policy could be revived.""The conversations are ongoing,"" Cruz said. ""And I continue to believe that there is a positive win-win solution for everyone.""Despite months of negotiations, the Trump administration has struggled to find a balance on a contentious issue that divides two of the president's key constituencies: Midwest farmers and oil interests. On the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump promised to support ethanol, a pledge embraced by farmers who grow the corn used to produce it.Refiners complain about the cost of complying with the biofuel mandate, while farm-state lawmakers say the program provides a crucial safety net for their rural constituents.On Tuesday, the White House indefinitely delayed an announcement of the planned biofuel changes, a development praised by both of Iowa's Republican senators. Chuck Grassley said on Twitter that the president had rejected a ""bad ethanol deal."" And Joni Ernst said Wednesday that ""there is no deal,"" because Trump said ""he's not going to sign anything that will harm the farmers.""Trump said he ""did the farmers a big favor last night,"" during a meeting on Wednesday with his Cabinet. ""I did a big, big favor for the farmers. We love the farmers and they were happy. I know that Senator Grassley and Senator Ernst were very happy with what we did.""Pruitt faces intense criticism from biofuel advocates, including Grassley and Ernst, who say he has undermined Trump's ethanol campaign pledge. But he is also under fire for allegations of ethical misconduct and questionable decisions.Nevertheless, refining advocates have strongly supported Pruitt. Cruz said on Wednesday night that it was premature to write off the deal.Refiners that are pushing for changes argue that they pay too much for renewable identification numbers, or RINs, the tradable compliance credits used to prove they have satisfied annual biofuel quotas. The value of RINs tracking ethanol blending have plummeted this year, despite a slight uptick Wednesday to 23 cents apiece.In the meantime, while the value of those compliance credits has declined, ethanol production has been at near record levels for most of the year on a seasonal basis. And corn prices are up about 8% on the year, driven in part by the possibility of grain production disruptions from bad weather in South America.Advocates for a biofuel overhaul have argued to Trump that the data show farmers' fortunes aren't tied to RIN prices and a deal could be in their interest too.Ethanol blending hit a seasonal record during the first quarter, according to government data. Still, ethanol's share of total gasoline demand for two out of the three months trailed year-ago levels.On an adjusted basis, blending is tracking 2016 levels, said Geoff Cooper, vice president of the Renewable Fuels Association. And consumption should be more robust, he said, given that government-mandated targets are higher than they were two years ago.Record exports are driving higher production rates, Cooper said. ""Exports are literally saving the day for ethanol right now.""

811,KEY,"""Avoiding behavioral risk"" is more than a Wall Street slogan to Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal. It is a tactic he has raised to an art form as he aims to remove subjectivity from his hunt for top-performing growth stocks for two Glenmede mutual funds of which he's lead manager. Fueled in recent quarters by leading growth stocks like Apple (AAPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Mastercard (MA), $4 billion Large Cap Growth (GTLLX) and $2.9 billion Large Cap Core (GTLOX) both outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets racked up that four-way feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award.De Vassal and his team — including managers Paul Sullivan and Alex Attanasiu — have become adept at avoiding behavioral risk in their investment process. Instead, they focus on more than 80 objective yardsticks to measure each growth stock's worthiness. They wear blinders to block out less-meaningful information that can be distractions from data that mark growth stocks poised to advance. Emotions are a major part of behavioral risk, de Vassal says.De Vassal, age 58, talked with IBD about his strategy from his office in Philadelphia.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportIBD: How do your growth-oriented mutual funds differ from rival growth funds?De Vassal: First, both funds use a similar process. The difference is the benchmark. For Core, it is the Russell 1000 Index. For Large Cap Growth, it is the Russell Growth. We control industry and sector exposures against those benchmarks.Our strategies are a blend of quantitative discipline based on underlying fundamental insights.IBD: How do you avoid letting emotions interfere with your hunt for growth stocks?De Vassal: We've built a library of factors, over 80, across the two strategies. In any sector, there are about 15 to 25 factors that we use to differentiate stocks. They're a combination of such things as valuation metrics, fundamental metrics and estimate revisions from sell-side analysts. We include some technical indicators as well.IBD: Give me examples of subjective metrics that you avoid.De Vassal: Subjective metrics that we do not use include the popularity of a company — its brand name — and nonquantifiable intangibles such as future products and profits that are not reflected in sell-side analyst earnings or revenue estimates. ... We want to remove behavioral risks that may have adverse effects on portfolio performance.IBD: Limiting downside risk plays a big role in your approach, right?De Vassal: We aim to win by avoiding negative earnings surprises and at the same time tilting more toward stocks that are more likely to have positive surprises.IBD: Basically, the difference between these two funds is that one focuses exclusively on growth stocks while Core Fund can own various types of stocks?De Vassal: In simplest terms, yes. And that means Large Cap Growth has much heavier concentration in technology stocks, for example.IBD: These funds are 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winners. What does it take to outperform so consistently?De Vassal: We have a very disciplined process. And both portfolios are well diversified. Performance isn't driven by being lucky or unlucky in one or two names. And we try to avoid losers, not just identify winners. We try to improve every year. This year we added two new stock selection factors. One is supply-chain data. The other is ESG (environomental, social and governance) momentum. We've been managing for some form of ESG strategy for over 15 years. We've found ESG momentum works better in some sectors, like consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology, than in others.IBD: Do you see the iPhone as the key to Apple's future? Or do you see additional services like the App Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay, playing a bigger role?De Vassal: We look at fundamental metrics like return on invested capital. We look at valuation. We look at cash flow per employee. We look at sell-side analysts' earnings estimates, revenue estimates, cash flow estimates. We ask ourselves whether new products and services are causing analysts to increase their estimates. (A sell-side analyst works for an outside firm, not the fund.)We don't have a fundamental analyst kicking the tires on Apple. We look at what's happened in the past. Which (outside) analysts have been the most accurate, looking back nine quarters? Then we look at what they have to say.IBD: Avoiding emotion in your decisions is a key part of your search for growth stocks. What's an example of that?De Vassal: Growth Fund started its stake in Adobe Systems in October. The stock was attractively valued. Later that month they gave (positive) guidance and the stock shot up. We sold in November with a gain over 18%. When a stock moves, we're out because it's no longer attractive.IBD: Mastercard earnings per share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your view going forward?De Vassal: We bought it in June 2016. It's done well. It's a holding. We're comfortable with it. But it's not a position we would add to.IBD: You've got Visa (V) as well. Do you like it better?De Vassal: At this point, Visa looks a little more attractive. Mastercard outperformed over the past 12 months, so its valuation is up. Visa's is better. Visa is still a buy for us.IBD: IPG Photonics (IPGP) is another newcomer to Growth Fund. Do you still like it?De Vassal: We started this in August 2017. The valuation was reasonable. Cash flow yield was around 2.4%. Not that strong. But fundamentals were good. Revisions were fairly positive. Price momentum was fairly good. We think revisions are more likely to have positive surprises than negative surprises.IBD: You more than doubled your share count in TD Ameritrade (AMTD) recently. Why?De Vassal: It was September 2017 when we doubled. Its dividend yield was reasonable, and so were its profitability metrics. Analysts were raising their earnings and revenue estimates. It got good (share) price momentum. We've done well with it.IBD: Brick and mortar retailers aren't very popular these days. But you've got discounter Ross Stores (ROST). Why?De Vassal: We still consider it a buy. We've been underweight in consumer discretionary. But we're getting more neutral. Part of the reason is rebalancing the portfolio in industry groups. Looking at Ross' metrics, it's got a healthy combination of valuation, fundamentals and sell-side earnings revisions.IBD: Citrix Systems (CTXS) is in Core Fund. What's driving the speed up in its quarterly EPS growth?De Vassal: It has good profitability metrics. And we've seen more analysts covering the stock, which could lead to increased investors interest.IBD: What's driving the uptrend in CBRE Group (CBRE), which provides property management, loan servicing and origination services?De Vassal: This is one of the best ranked REITs based on our proprietary stock-ranking screens. In terms of metrics, we look at EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and we look at the consistency of its risk-adjusted growth. Analysts are raising their estimates consistently.IBD: You've trimmed your exposure to Nvidia (NVDA). Does that mean you don't like it as much anymore?De Vassal: We cap a stock's maximum weighting at 2% of Core Fund and 3% of Growth. In contrast, benchmarks are too top heavy. They have too much exposure to the top names.We initially pursued Nvidia in Core in May 2016. The stock had an attractive valuation and improving fundamentals and estimate revisions. Its share price gained a lot, and it bumped our 2% limit so we had to trim it. It has continued up. It's no longer cheap, and it's not a position we would add to.IBD: What has driven the uptrend by F5 Networks (FFIV), which makes data center computing gear?De Vassal: Its valuation isn't cheap, but it's reasonable. Its fundamentals have been strong. Its return on invested capital and cash flow per employee have been favorable vs. its peers. It's got increased coverage from sell-side analysts. So there's a stronger likelihood for positive earnings surprises than some of its peers have.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Growth Stocks In Tech And Health Care: Fund Managers Like Their OutlookSee Which Stock The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingU.S. Treasuries Led Bond Funds Higher As 10-Year Yield Tumbled To 2.8%You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeFour Ways You Can Cut Spending In Retirement — With Little Lifestyle Sacrifice

815,KEY,"The outlook for growth stocks is good, based on projections for corporate earnings growth, say mutual fund managers that IBD spoke with. What managers aren't sure of is whether the pace of corporate earnings growth — and thus the outlook for growth stocks — will continue to speed up.""We continue to see a constructive environment for earnings,"" said Charles Shriver, lead manager of $2.5 billion T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $437.4 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. ""But earnings may have hit a peak in the first quarter. We do still see opportunities. But they will be driven more by individual names.""But John Wilson, lead manager of $3.8 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund (LEGAX), sees an ongoing clear runway for growth stocks in the technology space, where he finds the bulk of his opportunities. ""We continue to have a strong earnings backdrop,"" he said. ""In technology in May, we saw a continuation of many of the same trends we saw in 2017: strength as companies moved to digitize their business operations, and an ongoing move to more digitization moving forward.""And digitization is getting a boost from federal government policy. ""A lot of companies have additional cash flow from tax reform last year, so we see companies deploying that within technology and other capital projects to improve their competitiveness,"" Wilson said. ""That helped outperformance in May by technology stocks and growth stocks more broadly.""The S&P 500 gained 2.41% in May. That helped power U.S. diversified stock mutual funds to a 2.90% advance on average, led by small-cap growth stock funds' 7.00% jump.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBest Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportSmall caps thrived amid headlines that drove investors to seek safe havens in U.S. stocks. The on-and-off prospect of a trade war was one factor that pushed investors into small caps, which tend to derive the bulk of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., said Shriver.In addition, May headlines focused attention on Italy, which was about to elect a populist coalition that is seen as skeptical of the European Union. ""When there is concern about overseas events, U.S. small caps tend to outperform,"" Wilson said.Reflecting that tilt toward U.S. stocks, world equity funds lagged U.S. diversified stock funds, losing 1.09% on average last month.China region funds were the only foreign stock fund category to gain in May, climbing 2.82%. In sharp contrast, Latin American funds plunged 12.48%.Among sectors, science/technology funds outpaced all other categories, gaining 6.29% in May. Global sci-tech funds were close behind, rising 6.12%. Health/biotechnology funds tacked on 4.82%. The energy sector was also strong.Wilson said the digitization trend benefits growth stocks that enable customers to shift to cloud computing from on-premise software. It also benefits companies that are involved in digital advertising and marketing, he said. ""Whether it is Microsoft (MSFT) or Adobe (ADBE) or Salesforce.com (CRM) or ServiceNow (NOW), we're seeing strong end demand drivers based on the need for a lot of corporate America to take important steps to make themselves part of the growth in the digital economy,"" Wilson said.Microsoft continues to benefit from growth in its Azure cloud computing service. ""Microsoft is doing a strong job of using their legacy enterprise relationships to help companies migrate their business processes and operations to the cloud,"" Wilson said.Wilson added that corporate America sees the shift to the cloud as a key strategy for survival. Two to four years ago, companies' purchasing managers talked with Microsoft about their computing needs. ""Today these discussions involve CEOs and CFOs,"" he said.His fund also holds Micron Technology (MU). ""They're a leading provider of memory, which is now going incrementally into new applications in data centers as well as into artificial intelligence and machine learning,"" he said.In health care, Abiomed (ABMD) was a top holding of $11.2 billion Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) as of March 31.

817,KEY,"The F-35 is preparing for key operational tests that will allow Lockheed Martin (LMT) to begin full-rate production on the stealth fighter and massively boost its growth.XAcquisition rules require the completion of combat testing certification, or Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E), before Lockheed can crank out F-35s at full tilt.The F-35 underwent cold-weather testing at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, in February, as part pre-IOT&E activity. Then last month, the F-35 went through more pre-IOT&E tests at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., to evaluate close air support and combat search and rescue capabilities.Actual IOT&E, which includes rigorous combat testing, is scheduled to start in September (more than a year behind schedule) and finish by May 2019. That event will also test the F-35's 3F software package, which provides 100% of the coding needed for full warfighting capability.It will also pit the F-35 against the venerable A-10 in a close air support matchup that Congress mandated amid a fierce debate over the A-10's future.The F-35 is supposed to fill the close air support role left by the A-10, but critics say the stealthy fighter doesn't have the same amount of firepower or survivability in combat and instead called on the Air Force to put off the planned retirement of the so-called Warthog.Lockheed has a lot riding on the tests.The F-35 program is key to Lockheed's growth as it accounts for about 25% of total revenue. The company has been steadily boosting its production rate, but getting to full output would nearly double the pace.Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s last year, and sees production and delivery of 91 jets this year. By 2023, the company expects to reach 160 jets per year.Other defense stocks will also see a lift when F-35 output jumps. Northrop Grumman (NOC) builds the center fuselage and mission planning software, United Technologies (UTX) makes the engines, and Raytheon (RTN) is modifying its missiles and other weapons for the jet.Lockheed and Raytheon rose 0.5% in the stock market today while Northrop sank 0.55% and United Tech climbed 1.55%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

We could. They choose not to, and that's a negotiating tactic,"" Vice Adm. Mat Winter, F-35 Program Executive Officer, said in February.Meanwhile, defense officials are pressuring Lockheed to find ways to lower the expected life-cycle expenses of the F-35 fleet, which will cost about $1.1 trillion to operate and maintain through 2077, Bloomberg reported in April.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhy Air Force Is Rushing To Fly A Sixth-Generation Fighter JetHypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is Coming

Over the last year, the group has mostly proved its ability to weather the Amazon.com (AMZN) storm. Strong earnings reports in the past few weeks for several department stores have given the group new fuel.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Macy's (M) is the No. 1-ranked stock, with a 94 IBD Composite Rating. The rating blends key fundamental and technical metrics to gauge a stock's overall strength.The stock was a volatile trade after a flat-base breakout on April 26. The stock broke out above a 31.14 buy point, but quickly stumbled and triggered the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell signal.

821,KEY,"Is a break below the 10-week moving average a key sell rule? Yes. But there are times when you shouldn't sell.Using good sell signals properly to turn paper gains into concrete profits is a cornerstone of IBD-style investing. But you also don't want to sell prematurely when a stock's terrific run-up is simply taking a pause.If a stock is truly poised to etch its ultimate peak or go into a full-blown correction, it will certainly fall below the 10-week moving average. But the stock should undercut the 10-week line severely. And IBD's founder Bill O'Neil has said he wants to see weekly volume pop at least 40% higher vs. the 10-week moving average of volume before taking action.So, what if volume in the down week was dull? If you have a big enough profit cushion, hold. Give it some rope. Great stocks rebound quickly. Or they may be building a new base. If the stock finishes in the upper half of the weekly price range, you can infer that big institutions are swooping in to grab shares at what they deem to be reasonable prices. They are quietly expressing confidence in the company's long-term course.Here's an outstanding example. See the weekly chart of Abiomed (ABMD). The heart pump innovator broke out of a long cup with handle at 126.49 in April 2017 and rallied 58% in 31 weeks.During that nifty run, how many times did the stock finish the trading week beneath the 10-week moving average? Zero.It finally happened during the week ended Dec. 15. Abiomed closed at 188.71, losing 1.4% that week. The 10-week moving average, which graphs the average weekly closing price over the past 10 weeks, stood at 188.84. But volume was whisper-like, 25% below average. The mild price-and-volume action signaled to holders that one could sit tight.The Danvers, Mass., firm soon completed a five-week flat base. Shares broke out past a 200.38 buy point on Jan. 5. Volume after the new year holiday was light. But trading picked up. On Jan. 16, Abiomed climbed past 218; volume surged 88% above the 50-day average.Back in June 2017, Grubhub (GRUB) may have disappointed some investors when it flipped 8.6% lower during the week ended June 30. A week prior, shares bolted 10% higher. A big drop like that after a big gain like that sure leaves a sour taste in the mouth, no?But let's look at the volume.In that week, Grubhub traded 14.4 million shares, 15% higher than its 10-week average. (On IBD and MarketSmith weekly charts, the volume bars also feature a line that shows the 10-week moving average.) That's active, but it falls short of the 40% minimum jump that would normally spur a sell decision.The Chicago-based mobile food ordering giant also held a mild gain above a 42.35 buy point in an elongated double-bottom base. Right move? No move. Grubhub spent the next week mildly beneath the 10-week line, then made savory gains over the next five weeks.Another pullback beneath the 10-week line during the week ended Sept. 22 proved mild. Volume rose just 19% above average, and Grubhub nearly finished in the upper half of the week's price range. Grubhub broke out of a cup without handle at 57.71 in October and has climbed more than 90%.IBD Leaderboard name Five Below (FIVE) sank 6% during the week ended Feb. 2 as the major indexes began their first intermediate correction in 2018. But volume was light, 13% below average.The 33% swan dive by Kemet (KEM) during the week ended Nov. 3 marked a good time to sell, especially if your gains were limited.

827,KEY,"The Nasdaq outperformed other key indexes in afternoon trading in stocks today. But in general, investors appear to be brushing off concerns over stability in the East Asia region after President Trump canceled a highly anticipated June 12 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. A new Chinese IPO broke out.The Trump news didn't stop ZTO Express (ZTO), a play on Chinese e-commerce, from breaking out. However, keep in mind that the stock has a penchant for pulling back rapidly after hitting new highs.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved a 1% early-morning loss to nearly nil. Key Nasdaq component Apple (AAPL) erased minor morning losses and is trading near 188, up 5% past its latest 179.04 buy point in a seven-week double-bottom base.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average also cut beefy early losses to around 0.2% to 0.3%. The small-cap S&P 600 rose fractionally.Meanwhile, the Dow transports rallied more than 1.1% as airline, railroad, logistics and truck firms gained ground amid a 1.6% drop in WTI crude oil futures. West Texas Intermediate crude is now at $70.70 a barrel, still up 17% year to date.Please read Wednesday's Big Picture column on how stocks today are mirroring the bullish activity seen in the prior session. As noted in the Market Pulse table within the Big Picture, the S&P 500 has logged seven distribution days within the past 25 sessions. Yet these instances of pronounced institutional selling have not been enough to swat the key large-cap benchmark far from its all-time highs.At 2727, the 500 is just 5% below an all-time peak of 2872 and is up 2% year to date.The Nasdaq composite, benefiting from the strength in FAANG stocks such as Apple and new breakout Netflix (NFLX), continues to lead the major indexes with a 7.5% year-to-date advance.ZTO rolled past an 18.18 buy point in a somewhat jagged cup base that began a negative reversal Nov. 10. No handle formed on the five-month cup base, so the proper buy point is 10 cents above the left-side lip of 18.08.The 5% buy zone goes up to 19.09. Read this recent Investor's Corner on the importance of not buying too far extended in price following a sound breakout.Notice on the weekly chart how ZTO broke out of a first-stage cup-type base at 16.14, rallied 12%, then pulled back sharply to begin a new base. In other words, the stock's action going all the way back to July of 2017 can be seen as a long base on base, one of eight key patterns that savvy growth investors use to time the market and find the right time to buy top growth stocks.The other seven chart patterns to learn and master: the cup with handle, double bottom, flat base, ascending base, high tight flag, saucer, and IPO base.The delivery giant, an October 2016 IPO, has grown earnings 7%, 0%, 35% and 70% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street sees Q2 profit rising 67% to 25 cents a share.On IBD Stock Checkup, ZTO gets an outstanding 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The Relative Price Strength Rating of 83 means that ZTO has outperformed 83% of all public companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.If the stock can maintain its fierce new uptrend, that RS Rating should rise. The up/down volume ratio is very strong at 2.7. See it in the ""Technical Performance"" section of Stock Checkup.The Shanghai-based company has a float of 426 million ADS (American depositary shares) and 721 million shares outstanding.

See today's Stock Spotlight column for a discussion on how Netflix formed two bases, and why the first one was flawed.Netflix joined IBD Leaderboard on April 5 as a half-position stock, then got upgraded to full-position status on April 17.

828,KEY,"T.S. Eliot famously wrote that ""April is the cruelest month,"" but when it comes to America's fiscal picture, nothing could be further from the truth about this April.  The latest government numbers confirm that last month was a blockbuster for growth, federal revenues, and deficit reduction.One of the key principles of Trumponomics is that faster economic growth can help solve a multitude of other social and economic problems – from poverty, to inner-city decline, to lowering the national debt.We're not quite at a sustained elevated growth rate of 3% yet, but the latest economy snapshot tells us we are knocking on the door.  The growth rate over the last four quarters came in at 2.9% — which was higher than any of the eight years of the Obama presidency.Halfway through this current quarter, which began on April 1st, the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates growth at 4%. If that persists through the end of June, we will have reached an average growth rate of 3% under Trump.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNot bad, given that nearly every liberal Trump critic, trashed Trump's campaign forecast of 3% to 4% growth as an impossible dream.Economists like Larry Summers, Obama's first chief economist gloomily declared that we were mired in a new era of ""secular stagnation"" and that 3% growth was unachievable.Paul Krugman of the New York Times said it was more likely we would see flying cars than 3% to 4% growth.Now for the even better news. We are already starting to see a fiscal dividend from Trump's tax, energy, and regulatory pro-business policies.The Congressional Budget Office reports that tax revenues in April — which is by far the biggest month of the year for tax collections because of the April 15th filing deadline — totaled $515 billion which was a robust 13% rise in receipts over last year.MoneyWeek reports that the $218 billion monthly surplus (revenues over expenditures) this April was the largest ever, with the previous record being $180 billion in  2001. (April is always the one surplus month.)What's the simple lesson here? More growth, more tax revenue.But there's another lesson and it is about how wrong the bean counters were in Congress who said this tax bill would ""cost"" the Treasury $1.5 to $2 trillion in most revenues over the next decade.If the higher growth rate that Trump has already accomplished remains in place, then the impact will be well over $3 trillion of more revenue and thus lower debt levels over the decade.  Putting people to work is the best way to balance the budget.  Period.Critics will dismiss the importance of these higher revenue collections by arguing that the new receipts are for 2017 tax payments, which don't take account of the tax cut which passed in December.This ignores that some of the growth we have seen was a result of the anticipation of the tax cut.  Moreover, the fact that the tax cuts ‎are just sinking in, means we should get even higher growth rates for the next several years at least.Alas, it is not all good news in the April surprise. The inexcusable omnibus spending bill increased federal spending by some $300 billion in 2018 and we are starting to feel the impact of that splurge.  Federal outlays are up 8.7% in April.That's unforgivable given that Republicans run everything in Washington these days.No one thought that Trump could ramp up the growth rate to 3 percent or that his policies would boost federal revenues. But he is doing just that — which is why all that the Democrats and the media want to talk about these days is Russia and Stormy Daniels.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

829,KEY,"Venezuela trudged further down its road to serfdom when a sham election on May 20 returned Nicolas Maduro to the presidency for another six-year term. Venezuela's experiment with democratic socialism has now run its course from early optimism through economic dysfunction and now ever-closer to political tyranny.A mere 20 years ago Hugo Chavez ran for president on a populist campaign promising socialist economic policies. He won the 1998 election with 56.2% of the vote in what was considered a fair election overseen by international observers, including former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.Venezuela quickly became the poster child for successful socialism. Unlike the other socialist governments, Venezuela's was democratically elected and political freedoms were maintained. Incomes rose; poverty, illiteracy, and inequality all fell. Venezuela seemed to deliver socialism's promise unlike anywhere else in the world.Leftists in the United States praised Chavez after his death in 2013. Salon.com claimed ""Chavez racked up an economic record that a legacy-obsessed American president could only dream of achieving.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBernie Sanders, Oliver Stone, Michael Moore and many others praised Chavez for his leadership and Venezuela's economic achievements.Except it was all a mirage. Venezuela sits atop the world's largest proven oil reserves and Chavez cashed in on strong global oil prices. His socialist policies, meanwhile, caused dysfunction throughout the economy.A 2016 study by economists Kevin Grier and Norman Maynard, published in the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, compared Venezuela's economic performance under Chavez to what it ""likely"" would have been if Chavez ""had not been elected to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1998"" and the existing policies had remained in place.Their conclusion: ""Although average incomes rose somewhat during his time as president, they lagged far behind where they might have been if Chavez had not taken office.""The same held true in other key measures, such as life expectancy, infant mortality and poverty. Life expectancy improved, but by less than it should have. Infant mortality and poverty decreased, but by no more than would have been expected without Chavez's policies.Venezuela's economic mirage collapsed when oil prices tanked and revealed an economy incapable of feeding itself.The average Venezuelan lost 24 pounds last year — 19 the year before. Agricultural production is way down: rice, corn, and coffee by 60% over the last decade.The cattle herd decreased 38% over the last five years. When Chavez came to power, there were more than 800,000 private businesses. Today, fewer than 230,000 remain.Chavez's successor, Maduro, has resorted to the printing press to ""pay"" for import supplies. As a result inflation is skyrocketing. In March and April alone, inflation registered 18,000%.Meanwhile, price controls make it unprofitable to produce anything. The result is the downward spiral Venezuela finds itself in.It's hard to imagine any sitting president anywhere getting reelected when voters are literally starving amid hyperinflation. Yet Maduro claimed victory with a record 68% of the vote.Not surprising, since the government had banned the largest opposition parties and had violently repressed anti-government protests. The election was a fraud.Many voters went directly from the voting booth to nearby ""Red Spots,"" where the government checked their IDs and handed out food rations.The connection was not lost on them. It's hard to maintain your political independence when the ruling party hands out your food and determines your economic future.Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek spelled out the intimate connection between economic freedom and political freedom in his 1944 book, ""The Road to Serfdom.""He argued that only within a capitalist system is democracy possible and that when a country ""becomes dominated by a collectivist creed, democracy will inevitably destroy itself.""Venezuela's democratic socialism is no more. Its socialist policies created economic dysfunction while curtailing economic freedoms. Now its citizens are losing their political freedoms while Venezuela joins the long list of totalitarian socialist regimes.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

833,KEY,"President Trump has long argued that America's prescription drug prices are too high, and now we have a better idea of his administration's strategy.A document released on May 11, ""American Patients First: The Trump Administration Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs,"" enumerated the details.There are three key take-aways: Medicare will no longer negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies. The administration will seek to shift the payment burden from Americans to foreigners. And drug pricing and purchasing rules, particularly for Medicare, will get dozens of technical fixes.The plan seeks to push prices downward while only lightly addressing the underlying problem of how much it costs manufacturers to develop and produce drugs. This — regardless of the plan's merits — is problematic.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMany had expected and/or hoped that President Trump would move to authorize Medicare to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers.He advocated such a move on the campaign trail and some — especially on the Democratic side of the aisle — see that as a key to lower drug costs. But there are good reasons why this idea was jettisoned.The federal government has many virtues. Negotiating bargain prices is not among them. The U.S. military supposedly paid $2,228 dollars for a monkey wrench circa 1980 (roughly $7,100 in 2018 dollars).While the veracity of that oft-cited figure is hazy, the problem it represents is not. The federal government's much-vaunted market power rarely translates into a lean procurement process.Direct negotiation would also provide a gigantic invitation to graft.The federal official negotiating with Drug Company X today may well seek employment at that same company down the road. Given the purchase volumes involved, upping the negotiated price by a tiny amount would provide a sufficient windfall for Company X to finance a lucrative career for the negotiator.Companies have memories, so an implicit tit-for-tat doesn't require a handshake — or even a wink.The administration correctly notes that residents of foreign countries benefit greatly from American pharmaceutical innovation. The plan and rhetoric surrounding it imply that we can achieve lower prices for Americans in part by raising the prices that foreigners pay. This is easier said than done.There's the point that if drugmakers could extract higher prices from foreign markets, they would already have done so.Residents of those countries don't pay lower prices because their government negotiators deftly use their market power to bring drug companies to heel. Rather, their lower prices result largely from foreign customers' lower income, lower wealth, and higher saving rates than Americans.Even our wealthiest trading partners are, for the most part, poorer than America. It's questionable whether American manufacturers can charge significantly higher overseas prices without seeing volumes drop.The administration does correctly identify one problem that might yield positive returns. A number of countries abuse our drug manufacturers' patent rights. Cracking down on such practices could conceivably bring financial benefits to Americans.On the other hand, we might simply discover that without their patent-violation discount, these countries would simply buy fewer drugs.The bulk of the Trump plan is a long list of micro-adjustments to current policy. Some are, for now, aspirational: ""reducing patient out-of-pocket spending,"" ""improve competition,"" ""better negotiation.""Outcomes depend highly on the details that follow later. And in some cases, unintended consequences could even undermine the overall goal; the plan envisions mandatory price transparency which, as antitrust law suggests, can sometimes generate tacit collusion.To its credit, the plan does in several places note the importance of reducing the cost of producing drugs. But it misses an opportunity to shift our focus toward allowing for the same types of cost-cutting, life-changing innovations found in America's high-tech industries.Contrary to popular perception, risk-adjusted profit margins in the pharmaceutical industry are too thin to sustain large price decreases without commensurate production cost decreases.That, to a large extent, requires reforming the Food and Drug Administration's approval process — reducing production costs so price decreases won't discourage innovation or reduce the supply of drugs to patients. But that will have to await future documents.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

834,KEY,"Annie Turnbo Malone became a millionaire early in the 20th century, when a million bucks still meant something.And she did it the hard way: as a black woman without formal education. Against all odds, she combined an innate skill in caring for hair with an unquenchable desire to succeed to create a national beauty care product company. In the process, she gave jobs to thousands of African-American women who sold her products door to door like early-day Avon Ladies and even started a college for women that taught skills for success.Her unlikely journey began in Metropolis, Ill. Annie Turnbo (1869-1957) was the 10th of 11 children born to former slaves. Her parents died when she was still a toddler, so Turnbo was sent to live with an older sister in Peoria.Shomari Wills, author of ""Black Fortunes: The Story of the First Six African Americans who Escaped Slavery and Became Millionaires,"" noted: ""She was very smart. She looked around and saw her options were (limited): become a sharecropper or a domestic servant, and she certainly didn't want what she saw as a very hard life without money. But she knew she had a skill.""From a very young age, Turnbo had a penchant for working on women's hair, braiding and combing often difficult-to-manage locks. Her sisters and their friends happily let Annie work on their tresses, but also warned her not to vest too much in her foolish notions of starting her own hair care business, as necessary as it might have been.As Wills wrote, ""There was no defined black aesthetic"" for hair care in the years following the Emancipation Proclamation."" Women often braided their hair in an African style or covered their heads with scarves or bonnets. Some used harmful lye or bear grease in a misguided attempt ""to look more like white people.""Added Adia Harvey Wingfield, professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis and author of ""Doing Business with Beauty: Black Women, Hair Salons, and the Racial Enclave Economy"": ""Around this time, black women often considered their hair unattractive and unmanageable. Particularly in the post-slavery era, women had to work outside the home and they tried to improve their appearance to more conform to white society and be more acceptable to white employees. They'd receive ads for hair straightening products from white-owned companies that damaged their hair.""Though not in school, Turnbo continued to read about the latest advances in chemistry, which had been her favorite subject. One day, she read an article about an ointment that dairy farmers used to treat the skin of cows' udders. She purchased some from a local drugstore, mixed in natural ingredients from an herbalist to add a fresh, attractive aroma and created a formula that regrew hair in bald patches left by snake oil concoctions women had used in the past.She went door to door and stopped by as black churches let out Sunday mornings. Success didn't come immediately. The locals were skeptical. But slowly word spread that this product — she continued modifying and improving it — worked. She called it, appropriately, Wonderful Hair Grower. It eventually outgrew the small-town market.She moved to St. Louis, anticipating large crowds for the 1903 World Fair. By this time, she'd already expanded her line of hair care and beauty products for black women, including face powders, cleansing cream and shampoos.As she'd done back in Illinois, she hired and trained women to sell her products. She had to. Because she was black, normal distribution and sales channels were closed to her. But here the World's Fair proved a major boon to her business. It attracted African-Americans from around the country and the Caribbean. They were tourists who were not only potential customers, but also potential salespeople.She visited the fair as often as she could, pitching the idea every chance she had. In relatively short order, she built a national sales network.Around 1906, she named the company Poro. There is some question about how she came up with that. One theory is that it likely was named after a West African secret male society dedicated to discipline and enhancing the body physically and spiritually. Another was that she selected it just because it sounded African. In either case, it became clear that she wanted to connect her sales agents with their African roots.For Malone, it wasn't just about money. She believed if African-American women improved their appearance, it would enhance their self-respect and improve their ability to achieve success in all aspects of their lives.""The thing that struck me most about her is not only that she worked for her own success, but that it was important for her to help other African-American women succeed on their own,"" noted George T. Haley, professor of marketing and quantitative analysis at the University of New Haven's College of Business.""She wanted them to be independent, earn a decent wage and have a decent life. She recognized a salesperson's appearance (and the way she spoke) was a key to her success. It was something she learned on her own, and she made it part of the training for her sales force.""She was right. It was during this period that Jim Crow replaced Reconstruction laws. Black shoppers were excluded from white-owned stores and white institutions. The result was the creation of a sizable black economy stimulated by black-owned businesses.Turnbo not only rode this wave — at its height the company's sales amounted to almost $37 million in today's dollars and employed 75,000 women around the world — but she fueled it as well.  (One benefactor was Madam C.J. Walker, who worked for Turnbo and borrowed her formulas to found her own beauty company.)Turnbo, who married Eugene Malone (a former teacher and religious book salesman), extended the brand by franchising beauty salons around the country. She assured a continued supply of qualified beauticians and salespeople by starting Poro College in 1918. Given her interest in promoting a better life for black women, the school's curriculum went far beyond hairstyling and sales techniques. It included also courses on etiquette: how to walk, talk and dress — all this to prepare women for the workplace.Turnbo was the first black female millionaire and a strong believer in giving back.

841,KEY,"This week, the Supreme Court ruled on the Masterpiece Cakeshop case. That case involved a religious Christian man, Jack Phillips, who decorates cakes for a living. Two men came into his shop one day and demanded that Phillips decorate a cake for their same-sex wedding. Phillips refused.For this grave breach of civic duty, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission referred his case for prosecution, ruling that he had breached the customers' rights to receive service.The Supreme Court ignored the key issues of the case. It refused to countenance whether First Amendment speech rights could be violated in favor of nondiscrimination laws — whether, for example, a gay songwriter could be forced to perform work for an evangelical Christian choir looking for a tune to liven up Leviticus 18.It refused to consider whether First Amendment free association rights could be completely overthrown by reference to nondiscrimination laws — whether any business could be told to serve anyone for any reason at any time.Finally, it refused to consider whether First Amendment freedom of religion could be overturned in favor of nondiscrimination law — whether religious practice stops at the front door of the home and the church.Instead, the court ruled that the baker didn't have to bake the cake because the members of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission were unduly mean.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYou see, the commission pilloried the man's religious viewpoint rather than giving it a respectful hearing; it compared his viewpoint to pro-slavery and pro-Holocaust viewpoints. This was extreme and nasty.Thus, Justice Anthony Kennedy concluded: ""The commission's hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment's guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion. ... The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts.""I must have missed the ""be kind; rewind"" section of the First Amendment.Of course, the Supreme Court likely ruled on narrow grounds in order to achieve a 7-2 majority including liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer. But the ruling bodes ill for the future: It doesn't protect religious Americans, nor does it protect freedom of speech.In reality, the founders would have been aghast at this issue ever rising to the level of the judiciary.Freedom of speech, and, by extension, freedom of association, were designed to allow private individuals to live their lives as they see fit, free of the burden of an overreaching government.Freedom of religion was to be guaranteed by a small government unconcerned with the day-to-day matters of business. Free markets were considered enough incentive to prevent mass discrimination in public accommodations.Now, however, the courts have decided that the government can tell you what to say, who to say it to and how to act out your religion. The only holdup is that they have to be nice about telling you what to do.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Supreme Court Decision On Rights Was Correct, But Half-BakedMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

845,KEY,"It's time to give Facebook's stock some credit.After a data privacy scandal knocked shares of Facebook (FB) for a loop in March, it's recovered in spades — so much so that on Thursday the stock made a breakout from a first-stage base.Facebook's chart is compelling. It recently cleared a double-bottom entry of 186.20, but the breakout was in light volume. Facebook recently added a handle area to its base, presenting an alternate entry of 188.42.It's not often that a former leader hit hard by institutional selling is able to come back, especially after a lengthy price run. Shares of Facebook hit an intraday high of 195.32 on Feb. 1, good for a gain of more than 400% since its May 2012 debut at 38. It closed at 38.23 on its first day of trading.So far, Facebook stock is proving its mettle.Even better, Facebook's price performance since a breakout from a base in late January 2017 offers a great illustration of why IBD rules for buying and selling are always prudent to follow.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe base breakout in early 2017 wasn't perfect but still worked well and ended up being a perfect entry point.It cleared a first-stage cup-with-handle base during the week ended Jan. 27 in higher volume (1). The buy point at the time was 129.37. The breakout reinforced a steadfast IBD rule that says to buy stocks breaking out of bases when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. That was the case at the time.The base was first stage because the low of the base undercut the low of a flat base that formed a couple of months earlier. That served to reset the base count. The thinking behind a base reset is that enough sellers get shaken out of the stock to pave the way for more upside.But Facebook showed less-than-ideal price action the very next week when shares reversed lower in higher weekly volume. It was a sign of institutional selling — not good to see so soon after a breakout. But no sell signal was triggered as the stock held above the buy point and its 10-week moving average.Over the next several months, Facebook rode its 10-week moving average (drawn in red in the accompanying chart) higher (2). It didn't take long for the stock to trigger an IBD profit-taking rule that says to take a 20% to 25% gain in a stock if you have it. Why? Because that's typically the time a stock starts to pull back and consolidate gains after a breakout.In early August, Facebook started to take a breather but didn't correct much off highs. A flat base eventually formed with a 175.59 buy point (3), but Facebook had a hard time breaking out. It rallied 4.9% before settling into a new flat base with a 184.35 entry. It rallied nearly 6% from the second breakout before settling into its current pattern.Big sellers were in Facebook in the week ended Feb. 9. Shares plunged 7.5% in higher volume, giving up support at the 10-week moving average. It rallied for a bit before plunging again during the week end Mar. 23. That was around the time of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.But it didn't take long for Facebook to recover as Wall Street placed bets that the company would live to see another day without a meaningful hit to earnings and sales.Shares of Facebook gapped up April 26 on bullish Q1 earnings.

858,KEY,"It's a hard fact to face sometimes. Not all your swing trades are going to work. But cutting losses quickly keeps the damage of any individual trade at a minimum. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) provides an example. Taking action quickly avoided potential heartache down the road. For long-term performance, that gives you a greater chance at success.Investors had a strong reaction to Chipotle's earnings on April 26, pushing the stock up nearly 25% (1). What really stood out was the tight action over the next few weeks. The stock hardly gave up any gains. Plus, the declining volume suggested very few investors were selling.On May 16, Chipotle Mexican Grill cleared its consolidation as volume picked up (2). It joined IBD's SwingTrader on the positive action. Of course, the expectation was for continued gains. However, market weakness contributed to a pullback. The stock hadn't broken its support levels, so cutting it completely seemed unnecessary. But if it couldn't follow up on the strength, could this provide profits quickly?Reducing the position by half on May 18 acted as a compromise (3). If the weakness continued, the early sell reduces the overall loss. For swing trades, if the losses stay small, it allows the gains to compound and grow your portfolio. If the stock comes back, it can either be repurchased or at the very least turn the trade profitable. In this case, Chipotle Mexican Grill didn't really do either. It didn't see a decisive close below its 5-day moving average. But it couldn't seem to rise back above it. The 10-day moving average provided a level of support that seemed to hold. That is, until May 25 (4).Once Chipotle punctured its 10-day moving average, it was hard to justify holding any longer. Granted, the volume was minimal and the action continued to be tight. But if your stock can't make progress after holding it for more than a week, it's usually time to move on to the next swing trade. Even if the stock doesn't plummet, it may just require more time before it works. There's little reason to risk a downturn in the stock if it needs more time anyway. It's safer in cash, or even better, could be used for another prospect. The fact that the market was mostly sideways during the time made the decision that much easier.The average gain for IBD SwingTrader in 2018 is close to 5% in an average of seven days. Scaling out with the early sell kept the loss for the entire trade under 2%. The handling of Chipotle reduced the loss of money and time on a nonperforming stock.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Long-Term Stock Profits Mean Cutting Losses Quickly In Swing TradesWhich Moving Average Is Best For Profiting On Swing TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

861,KEY,"The U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May as the jobless rate fell to 3.8%, matching the lowest level in nearly a half century, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Wage growth, the key number for stock market investors worried about more Fed rate hikes, ticked up to a 2.7% annual rate.Wall Street economists expected 190,000 new jobs, 3.9% unemployment and 2.7% wage growth.Including an upward revision to March and April payroll gains of 15,000, the economy has added 179,000 jobs a month over the past quarter.Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures largely held onto early gains following the report. The 10-year Treasury yield, which had tumbled earlier in the week on a flight to safety amid Italy's political turmoil, rose to 2.92%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe big puzzle leading up to the May jobs report has been subdued wage growth. One possible factor is that reported wage gains tend to be understated when the survey week of employers doesn't include the 15th, the mid-month pay period. That was the case in April and May.Faster wage gains appear to be coming on the lower end of the wage scale as companies bid to attract and retain quality workers. On Thursday, Costco (COST) said it would raise starting pay by $1 an hour to a range of $14 to $14.50 starting this month.Other hourly wage rates will rise by 25-50 cents. Target (TGT) raised its base wage $1 to $12 an hour earlier this spring, while CVS Health (CVS) hiked its minimum wage to $11. Walmart (WMT), after boosting its starting wage from $9 to $11 earlier this year and expanding paid maternity leave, announced this week that it will subsidize an online college education for associates.On Wednesday, payroll manager ADP estimated that private firms added 178,000 jobs in May.

863,KEY,"The monthly IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a collaboration of Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, gauges how confident consumers, workers and investors are in the pace and direction of the U.S. economy. As with all of IBD/TIPP's proprietary monthly indexes, a reading above 50 signals optimism, below 50 pessimism.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is made up of three subindexes, including one for the respondent's outlook six months into the future, the respondent's personal financial outlook, and how the respondent views current federal policies. The goal each month is to give as accurate a reading of the current state of the economy as possible.The average for the index over the past 17 years has been 49.4, or slightly pessimistic. The index high of 62.9 was reached in March of 2002, six months after the 9/11 attacks, as Americans rallied behind the U.S. response to the terrorist attacks and confidence grew that the post-9/11 economy would not go into recession as widely feared. The index bottomed in August 2011 at 35.8, as the economy struggled to emerge from the financial crisis and key initiatives to boost economic growth had yet to have an impact.IBD/TIPP also produces the Presidential Leadership Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.View Questions And Full ResultsThe IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index eked out a 0.6% gain to 53.9 in June from 53.6 in May, the second straight gain for the index after posting two monthly declines. In February, the index hit its highest reading since October 2004. It's now the 21st straight month that it has been over 50 — which signals overall optimism about the economy. It is also above its long-term average of 49.4. The index stood at 44.4 in December 2007, the month that the U.S. officially entered a recession.The Six-Month Outlook is a forward-looking gauge that looks at how consumers feel about the economy's prospects over the next half year. The index fell 0.2% to 51.2 in June from 51.3 in May after rising 3.2% in May. The volatile gauge surged 11.4% in January, and then bounced up and down for several months. The reading for this index remains in optimistic territory and well above its long-term average of 46.3. This index stood at 32.1 in December 2007, the month the economy fell into recession.The gauge of how Americans feel about their own finances in the next six months rose 1.8% to 62.1 in June from 61.0 in May. The index's all-time high of 65.3 was set in January 2004, when the Bush-era tax cuts began to kick in. The Personal Financial Outlook is the most consistently optimistic index in the IBD/TIPP data set. It remains above its long-term average of 57.1.A measure of Americans' confidence in government, the Federal Policies component dipped 0.4% to 48.3 in June from 48.5 in May. It's down from its level of 50 in March. Still, it remains above its 17-year average of 44.8. This index briefly moved into optimistic territory in February 2017 for the first time in 10 years, and in March returned to that feel-good zone. But it has flagged during recent debates over the budget, tariffs and Fed rate hikes. Intended to gauge how Americans view government policies put in place by the president, Congress, the courts and the Federal Reserve, the Federal Policies Index has consistently been the least optimistic of the three subindexes that make up the Economic Optimism Index.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Presidential Approval IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsMay 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016Media ContactTerry Jones

The S&P 500 fought to hold a gain of less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite opened to a narrow loss, despite strong early gains from Qualcomm (QCOM) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Both stocks had kicked into gear, leading the Nasdaq 100 index, after the Wall Street Journal reported Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said China-based telecom giant ZTE would pay a $1 billion fine to the U.S. ZTE had been banned from buying U.S.-made components, due to violations of U.S. sanctions against North Korea.A planned $44 billion merger between Qualcomm and NXP had been stalled by Chinese regulators following the U.S. ruling against ZTE. Qualcomm rose 5.4% in opening trade. NXP gained 5.2% in early action.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Wells Fargo maintained the stock's outperform rating, and raised its price target to 160, from 155. Chevron is trading just below a 131.18 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Industrial test and measurement specialist Fortiv (FTV) topped the S&P 500 with a 4.1% gain. The Everett, Wash.-based company said late Wednesday it had offered $2.7 billion to acquire an advanced sterilization business unit from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). J&J confirmed it had received the offer, and had four months to accept.Twitter (TWTR) dipped 0.4%. Netflix (NFLX) dropped 0.5% higher. Twitter is logging its first session as an S&P 500 listing. Netflix joined the S&P 100 big cap index. Twitter is extended after a breakout above a cup-with-handle buy point at 33.88. IBD Leaderboard stock Netflix is extended above a 338.92 buy point in a flat base.IBD 50 stock Entegris (ENTG) jumped 3.2% after announcing late Wednesday it would pay $355 million to acquire a gas purification unit of Italy's SAES Group. Chipmaker Entegris reported the unit produced earnings of $33.1 million and $91.5 million in revenue for 2017. Entegris' early gain broke the stock out past a 38.35 buy point in third stage cup base.Despite powerful gains by Qualcomm and NXP, heavy early losses from Vodafone Group (VOD) and Lam Research (LRCX) helped drag the Nasdaq 100 into negative premarket territory.But Nasdaq-listed Zscaler spiked 31.8% at the open. The security software play's fiscal third-quarter results showed its loss narrowed to 2 cents a share during the quarter, vs. expectations for an 8-cent per-share loss. Revenue rose a much-better-than-forecast 50%. Zscaler has soared nearly 17% since the start of June, to 92% above its March IPO price. The gain sent shares far beyond a buy range above a 30.20 buy point in a double-bottom base.IBD Leaderboard stock Five Below blasted 19.6% higher as first-quarter revenue and earnings topped consensus views. Same-store sales came in a bit lighter than expected, but management gave Q2 revenue and earnings guidance well above consensus targets. The dollar store's gap up open sent shares out of a buy range from a flat-base buy point at 78.38.Also on the Nasdaq, recent IPO Okta (OKTA) launched 6.7% higher in early trade. The security software play reported a narrower-than-forecast loss late Wednesday, and forecast July-quarter sales above consensus views.First-time unemployment applications were largely unchanged at 222,000 for the week ended June 2, according to the Labor Department. That was below consensus projections for an increase to 223,000 claims. The four-week moving average ticked higher, to 225,000, its third straight advance.Bonds continued their downtrend into Thursday morning, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield 4 basis points to 2.99%.  Yields have held below 3% since May 25.Oil prices rebounded after taking a dip on Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate jumped 0.9% to trade back above $65 per barrel. Europe's benchmark Brent crude bounced 1.1% higher, putting it back above $76 per barrel.

871,KEY,"If you like a quick bite, you might keep in mind the fast food business is changing. Fast. McDonald's (MCD) is rapidly expanding its self-service offerings. And it is competing with Yum Brands (YUM), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Wingstop (WING) and many others to develop home delivery options.All aim to eat into what some analysts estimate to be a $180 billion takeout and delivery market.Grubhub (GRUB) has taken up a key post in that battle.

But Grubhub, the only publicly traded name among the three, has been rapidly consolidating smaller regional delivery plays since its launch in 2014.And it has some deep-pocket backing of its own. Yum Brands bought a $200 million piece of the Chicago-based company in February. Yum owns Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. Last year, Grubhub paid $288 million for Yelp's Eat24. It also acquired Groupon's OrderUp, as well as Boston-based Foodler.As with most retail and delivery markets these days, the big question resides in the shade of Amazon.com (AMZN).

872,KEY,"President Donald Trump canceled his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that had been scheduled for June 12 in Singapore, citing ""tremendous anger and open hostility"" in recent statements from Pyongyang.Trump's decision was communicated Thursday in a letter to Kim released by the White House.North Korea hardened its rhetoric toward the U.S. earlier Thursday, warning it was ready for a ""nuclear-to-nuclear"" showdown if the U.S. didn't follow through on the summit.""You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used,"" Trump wrote.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

873,KEY,"On the leading edge of the flourishing marijuana industry is MedMen's West Hollywood cannabis dispensary, which resembles an Apple (AAPL) store crossed with an upscale ski lodge. Touch-screen tablets on large, hazelnut tables display the buds' names and their prices. Clear, snowglobe-sized pods containing pot samples have a small latch at the top that customers can open to take in the fragrance. A staff member, one of many in a red MedMen T-shirt, relays customer orders via a small, clip-on microphone to a pickup counter.Big money is pouring into the legal cannabis market, potentially steering more U.S. consumer spending toward weed. And as the marijuana industry evolves into everyday consumerism, struggling beer and tobacco companies might find an avenue for new business in some of the increasingly popular products in Med Men's store: the cannabis drinks stacked in a refrigerator near the corner, or the sleek vaping devices and tins of prerolled joints, showcased in the tables' inset, fluorescent-lit displays.The trend has spurred Constellation Brands (STZ), the parent of Corona beer, to place a bigger bet on cannabis drinks. The creator of Blue Moon, the wheat beer owned by Molson Coors (TAP), wants to make THC beer. Former beverage execs have switched to the marijuana business. As for big tobacco companies, vaping devices alone could hand them a huge chunk of the pot market, a top Wall Street analyst says.Such moves face obvious obstacles. Pot is still federally prohibited, forcing shops to deal strictly in cash, even as California, the biggest marijuana market on the planet, and other states break away to legalize recreational use. Mixing alcohol with THC is also illegal. Less obvious obstacles include creating a cannabis drink that tastes like the alcoholic beverages we know and not, say, a weed fiber supplement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Andy Thomas, CEO of Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), whose beer brands include Red Hook and Kona, told IBD that pot is ""potentially one of the most disruptive factors"" to the beer industry, whether it's smoked, vaped or swallowed.""I think regardless of what kind of path you take, you can't help but say it's going to be another one of those forces that changes the way people socialize,"" he said.""You have to look at it as an opportunity,"" he added later. ""Otherwise I think we're kind of putting our head in the sand.""This month, Cowen & Co. estimated U.S. marijuana business could reach $75 billion by 2030 if fully legalized, indicating explosive growth. Its forecast two years ago put 2026 sales at $50 billion. That projection also compares with some estimates for current annual cigarette sales of $77 billion and beer sales of $110 billion, both of which are on the downtrend.Baby Boomers, seeking pain relief, are already buying more pot in general. So are more women, as cannabis products become easier and safer to buy in legal states. A report from the marijuana delivery platform Eaze, which operates in California, found that monthly marijuana spending last year among its thousands of users increased to $179-$189 from $125-$152 in 2016. An average-size pot dispensary draws more average yearly sales per square foot than a Whole Foods, and slightly less than a Costco (COST), research from Cowen and Marijuana Business Daily has shown.As the marijuana business shakes off threats from the Trump administration, MedMen, which has stores and other facilities in California, Nevada and New York, is trying to undo the stereotype of the pot dispensary as a windowless, cavernous weed deli.The company's stores have a bright, browsing-friendly atmosphere with staff who recommend cannabis products based on customers' preferences. In MedMen's store in downtown Los Angeles, shelves of creams, pet meds and Gummi candy line one wall. Near the checkout, wooden bins loaded with joints, packs of tea and other edibles, make up what spokesman Daniel Yi likened to an impulse-buy display.""Just the same way you shop at BevMo for your favorite Cab, the consumer wants to experience the store,"" he said during an interview in March.He said then that cannabis products that come in alternate forms — rather than the dry stuff people have been grinding, packing and rolling themselves for generations — could soon make up a majority of legal cannabis sales.Amid the influx of new marijuana users and shifting consumption habits, alcohol and tobacco companies have particular reason to take notice.As of 2016, the monthly rate of binge drinking was around 13% lower in states that had fully legalized pot than in states where it was illegal, Cowen's research this month shows.Meanwhile, Canada has been grooming itself to be a global leader for the cannabis industry. Toronto-based Cronos Group (CRON) has listed on the Nasdaq. Others, like Aurora Cannabis, plan to follow.""Ultimately, I see no reason why the global cannabis industry won't be as large as the brewing industry,"" said Cam Battley, chief corporate officer of Aurora.In May, Canopy Growth (CGC), which already trades in Canada, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. MedMen followed that same month, with a listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange that came via a reverse takeover deal.However, tobacco companies like Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI), which includes Reynolds American, might have an easier time carving a way forward.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, big tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""She estimated then that big tobacco companies could nearly double their underlying growth via the cannabis market and grab around a fifth of the overall share of the marijuana industry by 2036 in a fully-legal U.S.Rather than try to snuff out the marijuana industry threat, beer giant Constellation agreed in October to take a minority stake in Canopy Growth. Bruce Linton, CEO of Canopy, said the investment followed nearly a year of conversations. Canopy, he said, was inspired to reach out after Constellation expressed interest in the cannabis market.""That was the very opposite of most of the other liquor, alcohol, wine guys, which was: 'How do we get rid of this problem?'"" Linton said. ""And so we thought that's the kind of guy we want to talk to.""The Canopy investment further chipped away at a longtime barrier between the beer and marijuana industries. But for other companies to make a similar move, they'd need to create an affiliate or subsidiary in Canada, and repatriating earnings from cannabis sales could still be difficult. Constellation Brands did not respond to requests for more detail about its investment in Canopy.The ongoing federal ban on pot is just one obstacle for the burgeoning marijuana industry, though the Trump administration last week signaled it wouldn't crack down on weed in states that have legalized it. Another is getting a precise, consistent dose that delivers a predictable high.Some bars already serve cocktails containing cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonpsychoactive but often-mellowing component of cannabis. CBD beer already exists. But the substance is unlikely to ease big alcohol companies' worries about people swapping booze with pot.""To really solve for the substitution issue, it's going to need to be THC,"" Azer said, referring to the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol.But unlike tequila shots or bong rips, after which you generally know where you stand, edibles or THC coffee might take an hour or two.""People who consumed or who have kind of boomeranged to cannabis probably had a really bad story and experience with an edible, where they didn't know the dosing, or what's in it,"" said Sheena Shiravi, Eaze's director of communications. ""Education is really the key to that.""Eaze, she said, has tried to be upfront about products' THC and CBD levels, so that people can figure out how they react to a milligram or two. Lower-dose edibles, with two milligrams of THC, were popular last year, she said.Even so, achieving consistent taste in edibles and beverages — let alone one that doesn't resemble a rubberized, liquefied version of weed – has been another hurdle.""There have been a lot of folks in our space, the edibles space specifically, that have had trouble with uniformity throughout their products, making sure that one bite and one sip is the same as the next, or discoloration, cloudiness in the case of beverages and food, it can clump up and just taste funky,"" said Alex Howe, co-founder and president of Rebel Coast winery, which is making a THC-oil-infused, alcohol-removed sauvignon blanc.Chip Forsythe, Rebel Coast's winemaker and CEO, said he chose a sauvignon blanc because of the wine's citrusy, lemon-grass notes. And he said it tasted better than other wines when the alcohol is removed, while lending itself to some  characteristics of cannabis.But even as people look to avoid hangovers and alcohol's side effects, making that wine, he said, is far more difficult than letting the grapes sit around while yeast eats the sugar. And he said people still like the taste of the grape-based stuff that has existed for thousands of years.""We did a lot of trials in the beginning thinking that marijuana infused-wine should taste like wine and smell like marijuana,"" Forsythe said. ""We've ruled that out just from getting a tremendous amount of customer feedback on it. People really wanted something that tasted like wine, looked like wine and smelled like wine.""Thomas, of Craft Brew Alliance, said his company has held focus groups and conversations with people in the marijuana industry. He said he would consider making or selling cannabis-infused beverages and other products if federal prohibition were lifted. But he notes that pot regulations differ from state to state, and that competition can differ from product to product.""Trying to compete with weed at something that's predominantly in edible form is a very different animal than trying to compete with weed as something that's part of an ingredient form, is probably totally different than competing with weed, which is kind of an inhalable,"" Thomas said. ""And I think until we really know a lot of that it will be challenging for us to figure out what to do.""None of those products seems likely to wipe out demand for buds. Canopy's Linton likes the odds for marijuana beverages, which combine drinking rituals with the high that comes from smoking.""I've never had somebody say, 'Do you want to come over for Gummi bears?'"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Could Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?These Marijuana Stocks With Second-Hand Exposure May Surprise YouHere's How Enormous Marijuana Business Could Get With LegalizationThe Apple Store For Weed Partners With Nasdaq's First Pot Stock

875,KEY,"A U.S. and China trade war has been put on hold, but maybe not for long. For a few weeks this spring, President Trump's Make America Great Again and President Xi Jinping's Made in China 2025 seemed ready to collide. Then came word that China would buy more U.S. goods and the U.S. won't impose harsh new China tariffs.""Be cool, it will all work out!"" Trump tweeted about talks en route to a recent trade deal that China's state-run People's Daily hailed as a ""win-win"" for both countries.Trump's throwback vision — stressing steel, agriculture, autos and oil — may coexist for a while with Xi's prescription for China's centrally planned high-tech, high-income future. But the harmony can't last long in the world's most important economic relationship.Already, Trump, under fire over the China trade truce, said on May 22 it's just a ""start"" and then the following day said talks would likely need a ""different structure."" On Tuesday, the White House said it have tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods set up by June 15, though news reports suggesting that a China trade war was back on appeared premature.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMore broadly, the largely status quo deal won't alter China's grand plan to overtake America's technological leadership by nearly any means necessary. Ultimately, China and the U.S. could erect barriers in strategic sectors, creating an economic cold war that severs closely integrated global supply chains.Blue-chip giants Boeing (BA), Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) all popped May 21 as Wall Street celebrated Trump's deal with China. While their near-term future in China may be more secure, the longer-term remains as uncertain as ever.Made in China 2025, the 10-year plan set out three years ago, looks like anything but a win-win for the U.S. or any of Beijing's other major trading partners. Through state subsidies, acquisitions, market access rules and sometimes outright cybertheft, Xi is bent on closing the technological gap, dominating domestic markets and establishing global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence.The official aim is to steadily displace foreign components, achieving 40% self-sufficiency by 2020 and 70% by 2025.Concerns over China's techno-military ambitions are only heightened by its One Belt, One Road trillion-dollar vision to command global trade by financing infrastructure across Asia and into the Middle East, Europe and Africa. China also created the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to rival the World Bank and the D.C. consensus on the global economy.Yet it's unclear if the U.S. has the appetite or strategy to thwart Beijing's ambitions. Just 10 weeks ago Trump tweeted that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win"" and then demanded a $200 billion cut in the China trade gap. Yet rather than move beyond tariff skirmishes to a full-blown U.S. and China trade war, Trump gladly took Beijing's pledge to boost American energy and agricultural purchases somewhat. And that modest concession came after Trump pledged leniency for Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE, which violated sanctions on Iran and North Korea. ZTE had ceased operations after the U.S. banned American companies from working with it.Why was Trump so quick to relent? He may have favored a unified approach to North Korean diplomacy. Beijing also called his bluff, judging that Trump would have no stomach for a U.S. and China trade war with American farmers in the cross hairs ahead of key midterm elections.Trump also may have realized he had a much weaker hand than he had imagined.His initial threat was a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports. But Trump tariffs largely would have hit Chinese ventures of U.S. and other foreign multinationals, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found. The tariffs on mostly intermediate goods would have raised U.S. production costs, hurting competitiveness.""That the tariffs fail to hurt Chinese firms directly should not be a surprise,"" wrote Peterson Institute researchers Mary Lovely and Yang Liang. Made in China 2025 is an aspiration, but current Chinese tech prowess still lags that of the U.S. and others, they noted. ""It is impossible to hit tomorrow's exports with today's tariffs.""Trump said something similar about his desire to go easy on ZTE, tweeting that it ""buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies.""A Friday report said that the Trump administration has reached a deal to lift ZTE sanctions in exchange for another financial penalty, restructure management and hire U.S. compliance officers.Still, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains uneasy.The Trump administration's sudden shift from wielding a big stick to selling more carrots, so to speak, reflected a long-running split between businesses' short-term financial interests and national security concerns about long-term strategic goals, says American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Derek Scissors.Despite a consensus that America must confront China on trade, both sides ""keep fighting over how tough we should be,"" he told IBD.Likewise, Scissors says, a growing consensus holds that the U.S. must act multilaterally to hold China to account. Even Trump had a change of heart about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal cobbled together by President Obama to help counter China's influence in East Asia. Trump relentlessly criticized the 12-nation deal in the campaign. He dropped TPP, never ratified by the Senate, on his fourth day in office. But he recently told top economic advisor Larry Kudlow to explore getting back in.Yet saying we should act multilaterally is easier than doing it, says Scissors. He sees no realistic chance for a TPP revival. Instead, Trump is targeting allies with steel and aluminum tariffs and a new probe into auto imports.For now, America's strategic drift and Trump's status-quo trade deal are playing into China's hands. But Scissors says a cold U.S. and China trade war is coming.""We're heading into a cold war with Chinese characteristics,"" Scissors said. ""They aren't the Soviets.""Unlike the USSR, China is a rival but not an enemy. And it's fully integrated with the global economy. ""I don't think it gets as bad,"" Scissors said.Other nations have sought to climb the income ladder via unfair trade policies to build up national champions. Yet ""China now has the wealth, commercial sophistication and technical expertise to make its pursuit of technological leadership work,"" warned James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a submission to the Trump administration's probe of China's technology and intellectual property practices.It boasts the world's fastest supercomputer, half as many tech unicorns as the U.S. (private companies sporting a $1 billion market cap) and wildly successful public companies such as Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) that can give U.S. FANG stocks a run for their money.""The fundamental issue for the U.S. and other Western nations, and the IT sector, is how to respond to a managed economy with a well-financed strategy to create a domestic industry intended to displace foreign suppliers.""Yet there's also a clear military dimension to China's ambitions to become the leader in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics and aerospace.The premise behind allowing China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 was that trade would force its state-run system to gradually converge with market economies. That opened the door for U.S. multinationals to outsource their assembly lines, capitalizing on China's huge pool of low-wage labor. More recently, Chinese companies have been moving up the value chain, aided by strategic deals but also by technology from foreign joint-venture partners as a price of market access.Many have questioned whether the liberal technology policies of the U.S. and other rich nations ever made sense. Yet now that Beijing is directing a $300 billion national ""self-sufficiency"" campaign to minimize reliance on technology from the U.S., Germany, South Korea and others, its bid to buy technology has been met by a chill, if not paranoia.In 2015, when Beijing spelled out Made in China 2025, Chinese investments in U.S. tech startups surged to $9.9 billion from $2.3 billion a year earlier. The tide began to turn at the end of 2016 when President Obama, on the advice of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), blocked the sale of a German chipmaker's U.S. unit to Grand Chip Investment GMBH, owned by a Chinese company.Last year, President Trump nixed a bid by Chinese investors to buy Lattice Semiconductor. In March, Trump blocked a $117 billion Broadcom (AVGO) offer for Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. The apparent fear was that Broadcom, ready to move its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, would sandbag Qualcomm's 5G wireless R&D and give a leg up to China's Huawei. Facing pressure from U.S. lawmakers, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) this year dropped plans to sell Huawei's new phone in America.Qualcomm has long been in Beijing's sights. China has threatened to derail Qualcomm's merger with Dutch chip firm NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). In 2015, Qualcomm ponied up $1 billion to get out from under a Chinese antitrust probe. Qualcomm seemed to have bought regulatory tolerance, in part by lending its technology to a joint venture with Guizhou Province to produce server chips.China has used such strong-arm tactics to gain proprietary technology, costing U.S. firms upward of $200 billion a year, according to some estimates.But if Beijing won't give up its tacit encouragement of technology transfer as a cost of doing business in China, the U.S. Congress could step into the breach.Congress is weighing legislation to beef up the CFIUS to let it oversee more transactions, including technology transfer agreements, bankruptcy sales and early-stage venture capital deals. The VC industry warns that banning Chinese funds from U.S. investments will push startups to migrate elsewhere.The Trump administration reportedly has mulled curbing Chinese citizens' participation in advanced research at U.S. universities. A Duke University researcher is believed to have transferred knowledge to develop China's new stealth fighter jet.If China continues to resist competitive market dynamics, ""Western nations will naturally turn from managed integration to something more self-protective,"" Daniel Rosen, founding partner of the Rhodium Group research firm, wrote in Foreign Affairs.While products such as toys, furniture and apparel could avoid national security scrutiny, Rosen sees a real risk of disengagement in strategic areas.Countries don't follow Econ 101 textbook examples with trade only in finished goods. Modern supply chains and investment links often involve a myriad of countries for a single product, especially for tech goods.The breakup could happen in stages, as China marches toward Xi's 2025 goals.

876,KEY,"A U.S. and China trade war has been put on hold, but maybe not for long. For a few weeks this spring, President Trump's Make America Great Again and President Xi Jinping's Made in China 2025 seemed ready to collide. Then came word that China would buy more U.S. goods and the U.S. won't impose harsh new China tariffs.""Be cool, it will all work out!"" Trump tweeted about talks en route to a recent trade deal that China's state-run People's Daily hailed as a ""win-win"" for both countries.Trump's throwback vision — stressing steel, agriculture, autos and oil — may coexist for a while with Xi's prescription for China's centrally planned high-tech, high-income future. But the harmony can't last long in the world's most important economic relationship.Already, Trump, under fire over the China trade truce, said on May 22 it's just a ""start"" and then the following day said talks would likely need a ""different structure."" On Tuesday, the White House said it have tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods set up by June 15, though news reports suggesting that a China trade war was back on appeared premature.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMore broadly, the largely status quo deal won't alter China's grand plan to overtake America's technological leadership by nearly any means necessary. Ultimately, China and the U.S. could erect barriers in strategic sectors, creating an economic cold war that severs closely integrated global supply chains.Blue-chip giants Boeing (BA), Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) all popped May 21 as Wall Street celebrated Trump's deal with China. While their near-term future in China may be more secure, the longer-term remains as uncertain as ever.Made in China 2025, the 10-year plan set out three years ago, looks like anything but a win-win for the U.S. or any of Beijing's other major trading partners. Through state subsidies, acquisitions, market access rules and sometimes outright cybertheft, Xi is bent on closing the technological gap, dominating domestic markets and establishing global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence.The official aim is to steadily displace foreign components, achieving 40% self-sufficiency by 2020 and 70% by 2025.Concerns over China's techno-military ambitions are only heightened by its One Belt, One Road trillion-dollar vision to command global trade by financing infrastructure across Asia and into the Middle East, Europe and Africa. China also created the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to rival the World Bank and the D.C. consensus on the global economy.Yet it's unclear if the U.S. has the appetite or strategy to thwart Beijing's ambitions. Just 10 weeks ago Trump tweeted that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win"" and then demanded a $200 billion cut in the China trade gap. Yet rather than move beyond tariff skirmishes to a full-blown U.S. and China trade war, Trump gladly took Beijing's pledge to boost American energy and agricultural purchases somewhat. And that modest concession came after Trump pledged leniency for Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE, which violated sanctions on Iran and North Korea. ZTE had ceased operations after the U.S. banned American companies from working with it.Why was Trump so quick to relent? He may have favored a unified approach to North Korean diplomacy. Beijing also called his bluff, judging that Trump would have no stomach for a U.S. and China trade war with American farmers in the cross hairs ahead of key midterm elections.Trump also may have realized he had a much weaker hand than he had imagined.His initial threat was a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports. But Trump tariffs largely would have hit Chinese ventures of U.S. and other foreign multinationals, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found. The tariffs on mostly intermediate goods would have raised U.S. production costs, hurting competitiveness.""That the tariffs fail to hurt Chinese firms directly should not be a surprise,"" wrote Peterson Institute researchers Mary Lovely and Yang Liang. Made in China 2025 is an aspiration, but current Chinese tech prowess still lags that of the U.S. and others, they noted. ""It is impossible to hit tomorrow's exports with today's tariffs.""Trump said something similar about his desire to go easy on ZTE, tweeting that it ""buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies.""A Friday report said that the Trump administration has reached a deal to lift ZTE sanctions in exchange for another financial penalty, restructure management and hire U.S. compliance officers.Still, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains uneasy.The Trump administration's sudden shift from wielding a big stick to selling more carrots, so to speak, reflected a long-running split between businesses' short-term financial interests and national security concerns about long-term strategic goals, says American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Derek Scissors.Despite a consensus that America must confront China on trade, both sides ""keep fighting over how tough we should be,"" he told IBD.Likewise, Scissors says, a growing consensus holds that the U.S. must act multilaterally to hold China to account. Even Trump had a change of heart about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal cobbled together by President Obama to help counter China's influence in East Asia. Trump relentlessly criticized the 12-nation deal in the campaign. He dropped TPP, never ratified by the Senate, on his fourth day in office. But he recently told top economic advisor Larry Kudlow to explore getting back in.Yet saying we should act multilaterally is easier than doing it, says Scissors. He sees no realistic chance for a TPP revival. Instead, Trump is targeting allies with steel and aluminum tariffs and a new probe into auto imports.For now, America's strategic drift and Trump's status-quo trade deal are playing into China's hands. But Scissors says a cold U.S. and China trade war is coming.""We're heading into a cold war with Chinese characteristics,"" Scissors said. ""They aren't the Soviets.""Unlike the USSR, China is a rival but not an enemy. And it's fully integrated with the global economy. ""I don't think it gets as bad,"" Scissors said.Other nations have sought to climb the income ladder via unfair trade policies to build up national champions. Yet ""China now has the wealth, commercial sophistication and technical expertise to make its pursuit of technological leadership work,"" warned James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a submission to the Trump administration's probe of China's technology and intellectual property practices.It boasts the world's fastest supercomputer, half as many tech unicorns as the U.S. (private companies sporting a $1 billion market cap) and wildly successful public companies such as Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) that can give U.S. FANG stocks a run for their money.""The fundamental issue for the U.S. and other Western nations, and the IT sector, is how to respond to a managed economy with a well-financed strategy to create a domestic industry intended to displace foreign suppliers.""Yet there's also a clear military dimension to China's ambitions to become the leader in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics and aerospace.The premise behind allowing China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 was that trade would force its state-run system to gradually converge with market economies. That opened the door for U.S. multinationals to outsource their assembly lines, capitalizing on China's huge pool of low-wage labor. More recently, Chinese companies have been moving up the value chain, aided by strategic deals but also by technology from foreign joint-venture partners as a price of market access.Many have questioned whether the liberal technology policies of the U.S. and other rich nations ever made sense. Yet now that Beijing is directing a $300 billion national ""self-sufficiency"" campaign to minimize reliance on technology from the U.S., Germany, South Korea and others, its bid to buy technology has been met by a chill, if not paranoia.In 2015, when Beijing spelled out Made in China 2025, Chinese investments in U.S. tech startups surged to $9.9 billion from $2.3 billion a year earlier. The tide began to turn at the end of 2016 when President Obama, on the advice of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), blocked the sale of a German chipmaker's U.S. unit to Grand Chip Investment GMBH, owned by a Chinese company.Last year, President Trump nixed a bid by Chinese investors to buy Lattice Semiconductor. In March, Trump blocked a $117 billion Broadcom (AVGO) offer for Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. The apparent fear was that Broadcom, ready to move its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, would sandbag Qualcomm's 5G wireless R&D and give a leg up to China's Huawei. Facing pressure from U.S. lawmakers, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) this year dropped plans to sell Huawei's new phone in America.Qualcomm has long been in Beijing's sights. China has threatened to derail Qualcomm's merger with Dutch chip firm NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). In 2015, Qualcomm ponied up $1 billion to get out from under a Chinese antitrust probe. Qualcomm seemed to have bought regulatory tolerance, in part by lending its technology to a joint venture with Guizhou Province to produce server chips.China has used such strong-arm tactics to gain proprietary technology, costing U.S. firms upward of $200 billion a year, according to some estimates.But if Beijing won't give up its tacit encouragement of technology transfer as a cost of doing business in China, the U.S. Congress could step into the breach.Congress is weighing legislation to beef up the CFIUS to let it oversee more transactions, including technology transfer agreements, bankruptcy sales and early-stage venture capital deals. The VC industry warns that banning Chinese funds from U.S. investments will push startups to migrate elsewhere.The Trump administration reportedly has mulled curbing Chinese citizens' participation in advanced research at U.S. universities. A Duke University researcher is believed to have transferred knowledge to develop China's new stealth fighter jet.If China continues to resist competitive market dynamics, ""Western nations will naturally turn from managed integration to something more self-protective,"" Daniel Rosen, founding partner of the Rhodium Group research firm, wrote in Foreign Affairs.While products such as toys, furniture and apparel could avoid national security scrutiny, Rosen sees a real risk of disengagement in strategic areas.Countries don't follow Econ 101 textbook examples with trade only in finished goods. Modern supply chains and investment links often involve a myriad of countries for a single product, especially for tech goods.The breakup could happen in stages, as China marches toward Xi's 2025 goals. Or the impact on technology supply chains could be more violent, like a major slow-moving earthquake.Consider the chip industry in which U.S. and China trade frictions are highest. China consumes about 60% of the $412 billion semiconductor market, but three-fourths of those chips are imported (even factoring in foreign multinational output in China). No Chinese firms rank in the top 20 producers. Those chips are then assembled into finished electronics like the Apple iPhone, the bulk of which are shipped overseas.

879,KEY,"""For want of a nail…, the kingdom was lost.""  The old proverb, dating back to the 13th Century, and imported to America in Ben Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac, provides a cautionary tale.During World War II, it was posted on the wall of the Anglo-American Supply Headquarters in London —a reminder that the most sophisticated defense supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link.It's a reminder we need to dust off for our 21st century, as technology transforms all aspects of our lives, including the advanced weaponry that increasingly supports the U.S.'s battlefield superiority.Especially now, as we see headlines like this one in the defense press:  ""The U.S. is running out of bombs — and it may soon struggle to make more.""  The story notes that in the case of many key materials, ""…key suppliers are foreign-owned, with no indigenous (U.S.) capability to produce vital parts and materials.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe metals and minerals on which U.S. weapons platforms depend are all too often sourced from foreign suppliers – a vulnerability that America's adversaries could exploit in time of conflict.Until now, however, awareness of the problem has not produced action anywhere near adequate to reverse or even reduce this dangerous dependency.That could change, as the House of Representatives has added comprehensive critical minerals reform language to the 2019 fiscal year National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the massive must-pass bill that funds the U.S. military for the year ahead.With a push to put the defense bill on the President's desk by Memorial Day, focus shifts to the Senate and the Congressional conference that will determine whether the critical minerals provisions will remain.While the path to passage may be new, the bill is anything but, as the language is drawn from a bill that has passed the House five times in recent years, only to stall in the Senate.  It sets clear and consistent deadlines for a federal mine permitting process that has grown maddeningly opaque, resulting in a permitting odyssey that stretches an average of 7 to 10 years and oftentimes longer.Indeed, the only thing longer than the American permitting process is the list of metals and minerals we need for our weapons systems.As the Senate defense debate grinds into gear, expect objections that including a mining-related provision to the NDAA is improper, non-germane to use the parliamentary term.That's wrong.  In fact, one might argue that ensuring that the U.S. does all it can to ensure the reliable domestic supply of defense-critical metals and minerals is about as germane to the NDAA as it gets.According to the most recent U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Commodity Summary, the U.S. is 100% dependent on foreign supply for 20 metals and minerals, and 50% or more dependent for a total of 43 metals and minerals.  That's nearly half of the naturally-occurring elements on the Periodic Table.Such deep dependency is the catalyst for the President's Executive Order on Critical Minerals, issued in December 2017, which just this month produced the first unified Critical Minerals List, prepared by the Department of interior in coordination with the Department of Defense:  35 metals and minerals, from Aluminum to Zirconium.Consider it Exhibit A in the argument for adding Critical Minerals provisions in the NDAA.  The case for inclusion is strong:Connect the dots, and it's clear the U.S. lacks reliable access to a wide range of metals and minerals critical to our military's advanced weapons platforms — materials that in nearly two-dozen cases, we are sourcing from China, a nation that the 2017 U.S. National Defense Strategy identifies as presenting a ""central challenge to U.S. prosperity and security.""That's a five alarm fire bell when it comes to strengthening the raw materials supply chain in the U.S. Defense Industrial Base, and it's all the reason Congress needs to include critical minerals language in the National Defense Authorization Act.Finally, the U.S. has known resources of nearly all of the 35 minerals and metals on the Critical List.  Whether those resources can be economically developed is an open question — one that the private sector, and private capital, will be ready and willing to answer, once the U.S. Government sends a clear, consistent signal that it is serious about remedying our deep domestic minerals deficit.It's time to make the connection between critical minerals and national defense.  As Ben Franklin understood, America's adversaries surely will.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

883,KEY,"More than $1 billion a day. That's the price tag for a Permian Basin pipeline crunch that's increasingly affecting investors as much as it is West Texas oil drillers.Eight of the top explorers focused on the booming U.S. shale region have lost $15.6 billion in combined market value in about two weeks, as shipping constraints devour the profit they can fetch for a barrel of crude. Parsley Energy (PE) shares have wilted 16% in that time; Diamondback Energy (FANG) has been defanged, down 18%.Even as production soars, dwindling pipeline space and a rail and trucking shortage have raised shipping costs, boosting the discount Permian producers take to offload their oil. The bottleneck benefits refiners who can buy cheaper crude and pipeline owners with extra space, but it's dragging down explorers.""You just don't want to touch these Permian names,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, a Williams Capital Group analyst in New York. ""They are falling off a cliff.""Relief may not come until 2020, when new pipelines are expected to be up and running. For now, here's a rundown of winners and losers amid the space crunch:Being a ""pure play"" shale producer, even a Permian stalwart, is no longer the ticket to success for energy equities.Since May 21, the price of benchmark West Texas intermediate crude has fallen about 10% and companies focused primarily on the Permian have been shunned. The hardest fall: Concho Resources (CXO), which has lost $4.1 billion off its market capitalization as of Tuesday.As of Wednesday, oil in Midland, Texas, was trading for about $19 a barrel below Brent crude, the global benchmark price.Even Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), with relatively strong finances and secure pipeline contracts, has been swept up, Williams Capital's Sorbara said by phone. It's lost $3.2 billion in market value, or 9%, since May 21.While the shortages are real, he deems much of the market sell-off ""overblown,"" since even discounted Permian crude is selling for well above where many producers set their budgets earlier this year.Investors, though, are fleeing to the relative safety of larger names with more diverse portfolios such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY), whose shares are flat over the past couple weeks. The Permian's biggest oil producer also pumps in the Middle East and Colombia, with roughly 40% of its output this year based on higher international crude pricing, Capital One Securities said in an analyst note.The company also operates pipelines and a Gulf Coast export terminal that will benefit from cheaper U.S. crude prices. ""The largest companies or companies with diverse portfolios can rotate capital around,"" Sorbara said. ""If you're a pure play, the only thing you can do is step on the brakes.""With bottlenecks between the Permian and major Gulf Coast refiners, operators in other parts of the country served by less-congested pipelines have a relative advantage, analysts say.That includes Delek US (DK), CVR Refining (CVRR) and HollyFrontier (HFC), with refineries in New Mexico, Arkansas and northeastern Texas, among other locations, according to Barclays. Delek gets about 78% of its crude from the Permian, HollyFrontier gets 39% and CVR gets 14%, the bank said in a June 5 analyst report.Delek shares have climbed 7.5% in the past two weeks while CVR is up 3.3% and HollyFrontier is up 1%.""Simply put, we think U.S. refiners win big with lower input costs,"" analysts including Justin Jenkins at Raymond James & Associates said in a June 4 note.Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream Partners also stand to benefit from the blowout in Midland prices as they own crucial pipelines in the Permian and dock space on the Gulf used for exports — and have plans to add more.""The very idea of congestion is beneficial,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil research at Chicago-based Morningstar. ""If I'm going to pitch my new pipeline or expand my pipeline, and I'm going to hold my open season, I can expect to see a full crowd there anxious to sign up quickly.""Enterprise started full service in April on its 416-mile Midland-to-Sealy pipeline, which can carry some 575,000 barrels per day of crude from the heart of the Permian to key export facilities in Houston. They also own the lion's share of crude storage tanks and docks along the Gulf.Magellan operates and owns part of the 400,000-barrel-a-day BridgeTex pipeline, transporting oil from the Permian to Corpus Christi, Texas. That route is scheduled for expansion in early 2019 because of added interest. The company said last month that almost all existing customers on its Longhorn pipeline, connecting the Permian to Houston, have renewed their contracts for two years.

885,KEY,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumped to a 16-week high Friday after it gained approval for a rare-disease drug and priced it higher than analysts expected.Late Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration approved Palynziq to treat a disorder in which the amino acid phenylalanine builds up in the body. Phenylketonuria, also called PKU, is caused by a genetic defect. It can result in deformities, skin problems, mental disorders, seizures or intellectual disability.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond noted several pieces of ""really good news"" on the label and in the pricing. BioMarin set a wholesale acquisition cost of $488 per unit, which would equal $267,000 annually. The company expects it to cost $192,000 per year after discounts.Raymond had expected an annual price of $175,000. Some analysts projected $180,000. Further, the label only requires patient monitoring for allergic reaction after the first dose, vs. earlier expectations for monitoring following the first two doses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We have long viewed this approval as the lynchpin to BioMarin's transformation to a sustainably high (earnings per share) growth story,"" he said in a report. ""We would expect shares to move measurably higher from here in coming quarters.""On the stock market today, BioMarin shares popped 4.8% to close at 92.49. Shares jumped as much as 5% early to touch a high last seen in early February. Shares of biotech companies collectively advanced 0.2%.The label for the PKU treatment also only recommends having a trained observer watch the patient for allergic reaction, Raymond said. He noted ""this is also less burdensome"" than prior expectations that it would be required.Raymond expects Palynziq to generate $19 million in 2018, growing to $603 million in 2022. RBC analyst Kennen MacKay sees just $9 million in sales of the drug in 2018. But he boosted his price target on BioMarin by 4 to 98.""Palynziq's FDA approval lifts a key 2018 overhang for BioMarin, with focus now shifting towards commercial execution to realize Palynziq's potentially large market opportunity,"" he said in a report to clients.MacKay estimates around 11,400 adults are PKU patients in the U.S. Of those, a PKU clinic monitors roughly 3,900, with around 36% already on BioMarin's drug Kuvan. That leaves 64% of those patients eligible for Palynziq, he said.""Our model conservatively assumes that BioMarin is able to successfully transition the majority of these currently treated patients onto commercial drug by year-end, while we await signs of broader initial traction during quarterly earnings commentary,"" MacKay said.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz is more conservative. He noted BioMarin's goal of $1 billion in sales of the PKU treatment may be possible, but it will require substantial uptake and compliance. He boosted his price target to 146 from 145, and kept his outperform rating on BioMarin.Schwartz anticipates a slow launch and projects peak sales north of $500 million by 2029.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Sell And Take Profits Or Hold?

886,KEY,"IPO stock Gardner Denver (GDI) is shaping the right side of a new base formation.XWhile the company is on the IPO Leaders list, it was founded in 1859. The company was taken private by private equity firm KKR in 2013 for $3.9 billion before debuting again in the stock market on May 12, 2017.Gardner makes industrial compressors, blowers, pumps, loading arms, fuel systems and other aftermarket parts.In the most recent quarter, earnings and sales growth increased 280% and 29%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period. Analysts expect the company's earnings to grow 50% in 2018 and 9% in 2019.According to Goldman Sachs, Gardner is seeing strong growth in all three of its businesses — energy, industrial and medical. The broad-based increase in orders and share gains in industrial were particularly encouraging, while incremental margin improvements show the company's ability to raise prices and maintain cost controls.Goldman Sachs has a buy rating and a 36 price target on the stock — about 5% from Thursday's midday price.Within the industrial machinery industry group — which is ranked No. 85 out of 197 groups — Gardner is the No. 2-ranked stock, with a strong 91 IBD Composite Rating. The rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics.After a solid run-up from an initial cup with handle's 24.44 buy point in September, the industrial company is finally forming a second base.The stock's 24%-deep cup-shaped base shows a 38.10 buy point — according to MarketSmith chart analysis — but a handle may be forming. If the week closes with a loss, the new risk-optimal entry will be 35.38. Shares are about 10% away from the new high entry, but just 3% under the potential handle buy point.According to the IBD Stock Checkup, the stock has a B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Meanwhile, the relative strength line is nearing a new high, indicating strong market outperformance.RELATED:Yes, Technology Still Rules, As This Tech-Sector Play ShowsThese Stocks Are In Or Near Buy Zones Ahead Of Earnings: Investing Action PlanRoss Stores Reclaims Buy Zone With Earnings On TapIPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New Issues

887,KEY,"The long-awaited Saudi Aramco initial public offering will ""most likely"" happen next year, but it depends on the oil market, said Saudi Arabia's energy minster as he dropped hints that sank the oil market Friday.XThe state-run oil company, which is the world's largest oil producer and one of its biggest companies by revenue, was supposed to list a 5% stake on an exchange this year and generate capital for the country's economic reforms.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has estimated Aramco's valuation at $2 trillion, meaning the IPO could yield proceeds of $100 billion and dwarf Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion haul as the biggest-ever IPO.But some analysts say the figure is closer to $1 trillion. But even then, that would be bigger than Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN), as they close in on the $1 trillion mark, and nearly three times the valuation of oil giant Exxon Mobil (XOM).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRecent reports had cast doubt on Aramco's initial 2018 timeline. In March, sources told the Financial Times that it would likely to be pushed back to next year or possibly later. Later that month, sources told the Wall Street Journal that Aramco would hold off on an international IPO and instead list on a domestic exchange next year.Then on Friday, Saudi Energy Minister and Aramco Chairman Khalid al-Falih told reporters ""most likely it will be in 2019, but we will not know until the announcement has been made. All I could say is stay tuned.""In March, he downplayed the importance of the IPO's timing, saying ""between December 31 (2018) and January 1 (2019) there is no value lost for the kingdom.""Several reasons have come up for the delay. Previously, it was due to low oil prices, which would've weighed on proceeds from Aramco's offering. But until prices fell this week, they were at the highest levels since 2014.Other factors include Riyadh's desire to seek a higher valuation for Aramco before going public as well as deciding where to list shares. The kingdom had wanted a listing on major exchanges in New York or London but has balked at the disclosures that would've been required.On Friday, Falih attributed a delay to the market, in which he plays a key role as the de facto leader of OPEC.""The timing I think will depend on the readiness of the market, rather than the readiness of the company or the readiness of Saudi Arabia,"" he said.Falih wielded his market influence, telling reporters that oil production may rise later this year as Saudi Arabia and Russia debate how much to boost crude output over worries that higher oil prices could stifle global demand.U.S. crude tumbled 4.5% to settle at $67.56 a barrel and lost 5.3% for the week. Brent fell 3.4%, to $76.12 per barrel and lost 3% for the week.Still, Saudi Arabia won't want oil prices to fall too far as it looks to get a good price for Aramco's IPO.""We are ready. The company essentially has ticked all the boxes,"" al-Falih said. ""We're simply waiting for a market readiness for the IPO.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry News

888,KEY,"Wall Street expects the April jobs report to show the economy added 191,000 new jobs last month as the unemployment rate fell to 4% for the first time since 2000. Yet for stock market investors on edge over Fed rate-hike plans, wage growth is the key number. There's a good chance it will surprise on the upside.Economists expect average hourly wage growth of 2.7% from a year earlier, same as in March. Yet a host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour. Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. In March, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhat's different from 2016 is that now the jobless rate is nearly a percentage point lower, meaning more competition for workers. On top of that, numerous companies announced wage hikes in the wake of tax reform.The likely combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March.

889,KEY,"When mutual funds, banks, pension plans, insurance companies and the like decide to engage in sustained strong buying of a stock, they are relaying a key message to the individual investor or the small-scale financial advisor. These institutions are essentially saying: This company has a superb runway of growth ahead.Netflix (NFLX), a member of IBD Leaderboard, appears to be one such example.In the second quarter of 2017, 1,601 mutual funds and hedge funds owned shares in the large-cap entertainment play. How about now? In the quarter ended in March this year, that total had grown to 1,808 funds.Now, 1,808 funds certainly seem like a lot. Is there real upside potential for that number?Certainly Netflix garners many more fund investors than, say, the IBD 50 firm Viper Energy Partners (VNOM). The latter had 56 fund owners as of the end of Q1. What a difference. Yet Viper has a market cap of $3.7 billion. Netflix? Its market cap is $153 billion, 41 times greater.Yet even Netflix is nowhere near saturation when you consider these other stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), which got its growth engine revving in the second half of 1986, counts 5,548 funds as of Q1 this year. Alphabet (GOOGL) attracted 4,427 funds. Cisco Systems (CSCO) has 3,995 funds.Rising fund sponsorship and big positions taken by top-performing growth and value mutual funds epitomize the I in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point model for selecting stocks. The I stands for institutional sponsorship.Netflix sparked its latest breakout Wednesday, rising past a 338.92 proper buy point in a narrow flat base. As noted in Wednesday's Stock Spotlight column, the base on a daily chart met the minimum length, 25 sessions, for this bullish pattern.Elsewhere, WildHorse Resource Development (WRD) and Continental Resources (CLR) both underperformed Netflix on Friday as the U.S. dollar gained more strength and crude oil prices cooled off. In Friday afternoon trading, WTI near-term futures slid more than 4% to $67.66 a barrel.WildHorse remains firmly above the rising 50-day moving average.

892,KEY,"As congressional Republicans returned to their states and districts for the Memorial Day week, they were buoyed by recent election results and forecasts for November. The generic poll shifted to congressional Republicans as ""progressive"" Democrats — too liberal for their districts — won nominations throughout the nation.Concurrently, the benefit of Republican tax reform for low and middle-income taxpayers — challenged repeatedly by Democrat congressional leaders — was confirmed by a key congressional source. That shoots down the Democrats' main claim to leadership restoration, which will likely only further nosedive as conservatives wage their campaign for Tax Reform Protection and Expansion.The numbers are now in. According to Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the rich are now paying a higher share of federal taxes after enactment of the Republican tax reform plan than before.For 2017, before tax reform, the JCT estimates those earning $1 million or more a year paid 19.5% of all federal taxes, counting income taxes, payroll taxes, and excise taxes. But for 2018, after tax reform, the committee estimates that these same millionaire taxpayers will pay 20.4% of all federal taxes.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe biggest relative tax cuts resulting from the tax reform are for those making less than $50,000 a year. Their share of federal taxes fell from 4.4% to 3.8%, a tax cut of 14%.Indeed, the committee estimates that the federal tax burden went up for all taxpayers now making over $200,000 a year, from 49.8% before tax reform, to 51.3% this year after tax reform. You have to go down to those making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year to find taxpayers paying a lower share of federal taxes, from 29% of the federal tax burden last year to 28.8% this year.But how could that be? The fundamental reason is the economic growth effects of tax reform.Higher economic growth means increased wages, jobs, employment and income. As the economy grows, the share of taxes paid, especially by those earning higher incomes who still pay much higher tax rates under our so-called ""progressive"" tax code, goes up as well.Those same economic effects of the tax reform amount to economic liberation for the poor, working people and the middle class. After 8 years of economic stagnation under the neo-socialist policies of Obamanomics, the rising wages, jobs, employment and income under the long overdue Trump Republican economic recovery are making America great again for those with low and moderate incomes.Top economists estimate wages for average middle-class families are increasing by $4,000 a year due to tax reform. That's in addition to direct tax cuts of $2,000 a year for middle class families.These economic effects are why we now see the lowest unemployment rates among blacks in American history. And despite the lies of the Democrat fake news media, the lowest unemployment rates among Hispanics in history as well.And these economic effects are why Trump/Republican economics is now resonating among blacks and Hispanics culturally as well, from young black Millennials like Candace Owens to hip-hop stars like Kanye West.Trump is emerging as the gallant victor of America's new cultural Civil War. That is why Republicans are now moving ahead of Democrats in national generic polls for this year's midterm elections.Because working families making less than $50,000 a year pay virtually no federal income taxes, due to Republican tax cuts going back to Reagan, the Trump Republican tax cuts slashed a bigger percentage of federal taxes for these families than for those earning higher incomes.Every taxpayer received some tax cut under the Republican tax reform. But the tax cuts make up a bigger relative share of the taxes paid by lower income workers than for the highest income workers.Democrats openly abandoned blue collar workers in the 2012 election. Then, Obama squeaked by with the voter turnout of his hip ""rainbow"" coalition. But blue-collar workers, formerly the Democratic Party's backbone, got revenge by voting for Trump and his Republicans in 2016. Now it looks increasingly like blue-collar voters will let their voices be heard for tax reform in 2018.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Operating in more economically sensitive sectors, they may be more volatile.Abiomed is in the dynamic growth bucket.

It is the leading e-commerce platform in China, and its share is growing.""Alibaba is pursuing four markets that are extremely large,"" Burton said. ""The first is its traditional e-commerce business in China. The second is digital advertising. As the company adds e-commerce customers, it boosts its advertising business. The third is its cloud computing business. As it builds its online infrastructure, it can sell that service to other companies. And the fourth is its emerging retail business. It is taking its e-commerce and logistics expertise and applying them to grocery and food delivery, where there is a massive total available market opportunity.""Alibaba is a member of the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks. So are Netflix and Abiomed.Amazon, which is on IBD's Leaderboard, is in the fund's consistent growers bucket. The stock barely paused when it recently took heat amid news that one of the company's Echo smart-speaker devices recorded a couple's private conversation in their home and sent it to someone on their contact list without their knowledge.""Amazon is our largest holding,"" Kelly said. ""We're still excited about their two main businesses. The first is retail, which still has a tremendous runway to go. They have 5% of total retail transactions in the U.S., but they get 20% of the total growth. That indicates that they will get to 20% of the total market, so the opportunity is four times what it is today.""Amazon Web Services is the second business that Kelly and Burton like. ""We think it is in the early stages of moving corporate work flows from on-premises software to the cloud. Their technology for doing this is in the front of the industry, so they should remain the leader, with Microsoft (MSFT) number two, and that's why Microsoft is our second largest holding.""Among other holdings, ASML (ASML) is in the fund's cyclical growth bucket. The Dutch-based company is a manufacturer of lithography systems used to manufacture integrated circuits. Its shares are up 15% this year.""ASML has two key drivers,"" Burton said. ""First is global demand for semiconductor chips, which is expanding at two-plus times the growth rate of global GDP. It's driven by growth in cloud computing and mobile communications.""Burton likes ASML's EUV technology. ""It stands for extreme ultraviolet, and it helps makers of chips.

898,KEY,"Chart readers know that a W-shaped base is called a double bottom. So why is RealPage (RP), with exactly that type of shape, being called a flat base?The reason and proper interpretation lies not just in the shape of the base but its overall dimensions. Identifying those will help you tell the difference between a proper buy point and an improper buy point.With the Nasdaq composite rebounding from a few sharp pullbacks of as much as 12% this year, many stocks have shadowed those price moves. That explains why in the past couple of months so many leading stocks have formed bases with two distinct lows, thehallmark of double-bottom bases. Evercore (EVR), a member of the IBD 50, is one stock climbing well from a double bottom.A double bottom not only must have two clear lows, but the second must undercut the first. This tells investors there's been a second shakeout of weak holders. From the start of the pattern, at least seven weeks must pass before a viable buy point emerges. The buy point is found by locating the middle peak in the base and adding 10 cents. That price should be in the upper half of the base. Back to the original question, why are some bases that look exactly that way considered flat bases? The key distinction is in the depth of these two types of patterns. Double bottoms normally decline as much as 33% from top to lowest point. By comparison, flat bases are shallower — less than 15% in depth. Another difference is that flat bases can form in as few as five weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRealPage had a total decline of 13%, which made it a legitimate flat base. Zebra Tech (ZBRA), the inventory tracking technology company, also had two distinct lows in its March-to-early-May base. But it wasn't deep enough for a double bottom. The stock corrected only 12% and was better interpreted as a flat base.This raises another question: In a flat base that resembles a double bottom, can the middle peak be used as a proper buy point? Normally, no. A flat base is already shallow enough, so the surest entry is when the stock makes a new high.But in some cases, an early entry can be identified in a flat base. In Zebra's case, 146.79 could have been used as a perfectly acceptable alternative entry. The stock surged past that level (and the prior high) on May 8 in heavy volume following an earnings report. There was little doubt that the lower entry was just as good as the higher.RELATED:5 Keys To Spot The Base On BaseWhat Does A Double-Bottom Base Look Like?

900,KEY,"Wall Street was split Wednesday on Celgene (CELG) as one sell-side analyst downgraded the stock saying it ""has tilted to greater risk"" while another upgraded shares of the beleaguered biotech company.On the stock market today, Celgene shares gained 1.4% to close at 77.66. But shares crumbled to a four-year low on Monday on a report its head of business development exited in April. Shares of biotech companies rose a fraction.On Wednesday, Argus analyst David Toung downgraded Celgene to hold rating from buy. But, at the same time, analysts with Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded the stock to an outperform rating from market perform, reportedly saying its valuation is too cheap to ignore.Toung, though, is concerned about the longevity of cancer drug Revlimid. Generic pharmaceutical companies like Mylan (MYL) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) are vying to make copycats of Revlimid. Revlimid's patents extend until 2024 in the U.S. and 2027 in Europe.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""If one or more Revlimid patents are invalidated, broad generic competition could begin before 2023,"" he said in a report to clients.That would be devastating for Celgene, which brought in $8.19 billion in Revlimid sales in 2017. To contend, Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics. Juno's leading drug candidate, a cancer treatment, could bring in up to $3 billion in peak-year sales, but Toung doesn't expect a commercial launch for 18 months.Celgene also put down $1.1 billion to acquire Impact Biomedicines, which has an experimental cancer drug. The firm plans to file for approval of its key drug in mid-2018. It's also working with Bluebird Bio (BLUE) on a multiple myeloma treatment.""While these pipeline assets are promising, their combined potential revenue is not enough to completely replace Revlimid, in our view,"" Toung said.Toung's assessment follows a Food and Drug Administration list that attempts to ""shame"" several pharmaceutical companies for blocking generic competition for big drugs. Among large biotech companies the FDA also lists Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB).Celgene has also had a number of missteps in recent history. Last October, it scrapped studies of a drug called GED-301 as a Crohn's disease treatment. In February, the FDA said it wouldn't review a drug called ozanimod in multiple sclerosis. That drug is now delayed by at least a year.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top? Easy: Look For Heavy DistributionInvesting Basics: How To Sell A StockSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

Humira is AbbVie's most important drug. It treats several forms of arthritis and psoriasis, as well as Crohn's disease.Investors long have been concerned about the potential for rival copycats, in this case biosimilars, to wrest revenue from Humira, a massive blockbuster that is often cited as the industry's best-selling drug.

AbbVie is also working to grab new approvals for cancer drugs Venclexta and Imbruvica.To that latter point, AbbVie said Thursday a regimen containing cancer drugs Imbruvica and Gazyva, from Roche (RHHBY) subsidiary Genentech, met its key goal of improving progression-free survival in two types of blood and bone marrow cancer. The regimen outperformed a combination of Gazyva and chemotherapy.Also since March 2017, the firm has meaningfully increased its dividends by 46%.

906,KEY,"The stock market rally isn't quite dead. The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 sold off Friday, but all held above their recent lows. But the chip sector, along with key semiconductor stocks Nvidia (NVDA), Applied Materials (AMAT), Texas Instruments (TXN), undercut recent levels Friday, while Micron Technology (MU) wiped out big gains and flashed sell signals.The chip action is worrisome for the stock market rally attempt. It's hard for stocks to have a sustained advance without chips taking part. For one, chips are a big part of the overall market, especially the tech sector. Second, if chip stocks are struggling, that could be a bad sign for demand in the vast array of products that use chips, from the Apple (AAPL) iPhone to a Tesla (TSLA) Model 3.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbled 3.1% on Friday, undercutting its April 2 low. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) ETF also did so. Notably, the Philly Sox index retreated on Thursday. The major averages rose somewhat that day, but volume was light and the Nasdaq lagged.Nvidia retreated 7.5% last week to a two-month low. But its real problems began March 27, when Nvidia said that it was halting self-driving tests. That also was bad news for Nvidia customer Tesla. That was a bad day for the general market, with the Nasdaq finding resistance at the 50-day line and reversing sharply lower.But there were warning signs earlier that day. Soon after the March 27 open, Applied Materials and fellow chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX) reclaimed buy points, but quickly backed off.Last week Applied Materials skidded 5.9% last week to its worst levels since mid-February, approaching its 200-day line. Texas Instruments' relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a two-month low. Several other chip stocks undercut recent lows, including Lam Research, Apple chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMicron Technology was a rare chip stock that was a market leader in recent weeks. Micron had a powerful breakout from late February and rapidly ran up. But the memory-chip giant has sold off 23% from its March 13. On Friday, shares nearly completed a round trip back to the 47.08 double-bottom base buy point. Micron closed below its 50-day line.Micron's sell-off dragged down several other memory plays, including chip-gear makers Applied Materials and Lam.However, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF, Nvidia and Micron were all up about 1% in premarket trading Monday.Another factors also aren't encouraging. The three-day stock market rally came on increasingly light volume, while Friday's sell-off came on heavier trade. That's classic stock market correction behavior.Some recent breakouts, such as Five Below (FIVE), Vipor Energy Partners (VNOM), fell back below buy points on Friday. Apple and Netflix (NFLX), which reclaimed their 50-day moving averages by Thursday, fell back below those levels on Friday.Despite Friday's big retreat, the put/call ratio came in at a relatively tame 1.04. That fear gauge is below the 1.15 level that often indicates a short-term bottom. The market has several big sell-offs over the past 10 weeks, only to bounce back quickly, sometimes that very day. So even a stock market correction, investors may be complacent.Instead, that lack of investor panic should be one more reason to worry. If nothing else, the recent market swings should underscore the importance of not trying to jump back into stocks before a confirmed rally.As long as the major averages hold above recent lows, the stock market rally attempt is still live.

911,KEY,"A China-based new issue snapped free of its IPO base Tuesday and Wednesday, and Boise, Idaho's largest building products manufacturer remained in a buy range after a Friday breakout.But bank stocks Wednesday occupied nearly half of an Investor's Business Daily screen showing 32 stocks hitting new highs during the session, according to preliminary calculations. All of those were regional banks, most responding to banking reform legislation passed Tuesday and awaiting only a signature from President Trump in order to become law.The bill, among many other things, rolls back compliance oversight on banks managing between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets. All of the banks in that range which were hashing out new highs Wednesday traded well below the 400,000 share-per-day minimum required for CAN SLIM-grade stocks.Another new high went briefly to Urban Outfitters (URBN). The parent of the Anthropologie and Urban Outfitter chains reported a strong first-quarter beat, including a 280% surge in earnings. But sellers took control of the stock shortly after the open, driving the stock down nearly 1%. Shares remained extended above a 36.20 buy point.China-based IPO OneSmart International (ONE) trades more than 500,000 shares per day on average. The company provides after-school educational services for kindergarten through 12th grade students, similar to the much larger TAL Education Group (TAL).TAL has been among the top China-based stocks, rising 111% over the past year. On Wednesday, the stock was in a buy range above a 43.58 flat base buy point. However, the base was very late stage. That meant the breakout bore an above-average risk of failure.OneSmart is at the opposite end of the spectrum. Shares spiked 9% Tuesday and 10% on Wednesday. That left the stock 23% above its March 28 IPO price and extended above an 11.96 buy point in a three-week IPO base.IPOs can be wild, and OneSmart is no exception. The stock dived 22% below its IPO price April 30. That set the stage for the stock's first consolidation. Investors who jumped in at the buy point will want to make sure they stick hard-and-fast to the rule that triggers an automatic sale when a stock falls 7% to 8% below its buy point.Boise Cascade (BCC) retouched its high from Tuesday during Wednesday's session. It then pulled back, remaining well within buy range above a cup-with-handle buy point at 45.20.Boise earned 85% of its 2017 revenue through distributing building materials made by other manufacturers. The remainder came from its lumber-products manufacturing business.The outfit has reported three quarters of accelerating revenue growth.

916,KEY,"Botox maker Allergan (AGN) is looking to sell its women's health and infectious diseases units, but it won't engage in a ""fire sale"" to do so, Chief Executive Brent Saunders said Wednesday.Allergan is eyeing the potential sale of both units amid a strategic review that began earlier in the year. A sale would allow Allergan to focus on four key segments: medical aesthetics, central nervous system, gastrointestinal and eye care.But the firm isn't feeling pressure to sell, Saunders said.""It takes another party to consummate a deal,"" he said during a conference hosted by Bernstein. ""We will not sell those businesses unless we get the intrinsic value we believe they deserve. There is no fire sale at Allergan; there's no undue pressure to sell them for a bargain-basement price.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Women's health declined by a third to $163.3 million.The biggest drug in women's health is birth control pill Lo Loestrin. On Tuesday, Allergan voluntarily recalled a batch of its Taytulla birth control pills, which was incorrectly packaged. Its Teflaro drug leads the anti-infective unit, treating skin infections and a form of pneumonia.Divesting these businesses would fall under the potential outcome of a strategic review noted earlier in the year. Saunders also said Allergan would consider splitting the business, buying back shares, making acquisitions or maintaining the business as is.In April, Saunders was seemingly against splitting the company, which would be long and disruptive. He reiterated that viewpoint Wednesday during the Bernstein conference when an analyst asked whether the firm could just split medical aesthetics from everything else.""There may be a time in the future where that is feasible,"" he said. ""Today, it's hard to see how that works.""Saunders noted that medical aesthetics, central nervous system, gastrointestinal and eye care all share resources to be successful. Botox, for instance, is used in both medical aesthetics and as a therapeutic.

Golumbeski then moved to more of a strategic role. Hershberg was responsible for the deals with Juno Therapeutics and Impact Biomedicines.""Given that this has been a transition in the works for some time, we do not see any relation between reports about this emerging today and proximity to upcoming (clinical study) readouts,"" Abrahams said in a report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Abrahams noted investor sentiment on Celgene has been low this year.Two weeks before Golumbeski's departure on April 16, former chief operating officer Scott Smith unexpectedly departed Celgene. Smith had been instrumental in helping to launch Otezla, one of Celgene's biggest moneymakers.Celgene delivered a beat-and-raise earlier this month. Otezla sales grew and beat views. Still, investors are wary of the inflammation and immunology franchise. In February, U.S. officials delayed Celgene's application for multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod.Meanwhile, investors are also concerned about a looming patent cliff for key cancer drug Revlimid. Celgene is hoping the acquisition of Juno will help offset some of that. Juno is working on a number of cancer treatments.Abrahams found it ""somewhat ironic"" that shares would sell off on news of Golumbeski's departure. Investors have long been critical of the biotech company's business development strategy, which they see as not sufficiently preparing for post-Revlimid revenue sustainability.""However, we do believe it illustrates the sharply negative sentiment pervasive in the name, which we continue to believe will require a turnaround in catalysts to improve on,"" he said.RELATED:New Option Strategy Limits Risk Around EarningsHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?The Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle

The building of a network of vehicle charging stations will exacerbate the shortage issues, according to the note.Ford shares were down 0.2% on the stock market today, after reporting monthly sales.

Conversely, Cobalt looks likely to be in significant deficit, perhaps as early 2018.Mining stocks such as Rio Tinto (RIO) and Mining-Metal Ores Group leader Southern Copper (SCCO) could benefit, however rising prices will also cause volatility, Moody's said.And environmental concerns and political dynamics could make bringing new mining capacity on line a challenge.""The need for development of new mines, smelters and refineries, chemical use in the processing, and water and discharge issues will exacerbate existing environmental challenges in the sector,"" the note said. ""Additionally, resource nationalism sentiment and other political factors — e.g. imposition of export controls, changes in tax and royalty payments — in key producing countries, have the potential to add to supply constraints and/or costs.""Moody's warning comes after Morgan Stanley said in February that new and expanded lithium mines in Chile ""threaten to add"" roughly 500,000 metric tons per year to global supplies by 2025. They predict lithium prices will crash 45% by 2021.Morgan Stanley downgraded Albemarle to underweight from equal weight and lowered its price target to 85 from 100, and also downgraded SQM to underweight from equal weight.In January, SQM and the Chilean government reached a deal to increase production as battery demand climbs.Tesla is already under pressure over the pace and trajectory of Model 3 production. Tesla's lower-priced model has stumbled out of the gate and caused shares, as well as capital spending, to fluctuate.

But if quitting isn't an option, learning to improve work relationships is key.""You're going to have a spectrum of bosses,"" said Mary Abbajay, a workplace consultant and author of ""Managing Up: How to Move Up, Win at Work, and Succeed with Any Type of Boss."" ""It's like a puzzle. You have to decide: What is important to them, and how can you work with them and learn.""Here's how to succeed with any type of boss:The narcissist. Handle this boss with care. ""You have to be thoughtful,"" Abbajay said. ""Sycophants are most likely to survive (this boss); it's sad but true.""But you don't have to sell your soul to be one of the survivors, Abbajay adds. ""Find a good side. You don't want to be inauthentic,"" she said. ""If you want them to shift behavior, focus on how your ideas will improve their image. They don't have empathy, but they care about their image.""The upside to having this boss? They tend to be very successful, Abbajay says. You can at least learn a lot while you stick with this boss until you find a better fit.The impulsive boss. Wait for the storm to pass. Don't react to every idea. Recognize the good intentions behind this type of boss. They often want to make a difference and are open to new ways to achieve this goal.""Let them talk about it and tell them you will think about what they've said,"" Abbajay said. Come back later and show them what can be done and what really isn't achievable, she adds.Be careful not to be a yes person with this boss, no matter how enthusiastic they seem. They are likely to change their minds often, and you will have wasted your time planning for all the ideas they had.""Don't jump down the rabbit hole too quickly,"" Abbajay said. ""Wait three or four days; if the idea stuck, then work on it. Pay attention to your boss' rhythm without being a wet blanket or rolling your eyes. Don't be an Eeyore.""The pushover. As frustrating as it is to know that your boss won't ever speak out or stand for anything, especially if it's controversial, this boss offers opportunities for you to shine. Fill the power vacuum with honorable intentions, Abbajay says.Say you're tired of working with a team of slackers, but your boss just shrugs it off because in the end the work gets done (mostly by you, of course).""Step up without undermining your boss,"" Abbajay said.Offer concrete solutions to your problem. Bolster their position by giving them options and information.""Say: Here are the three ways we can fix this and here's why you should consider them,"" Abbajay suggested. ""It helps them develop a backbone.""The incompetent. First set aside your ego and assess if your boss is truly incompetent or if you're overrating your own abilities. If your boss is truly in over his or her head, step up, compensate and deliver. Your assistance will be noticed and rewarded, Abbajay says.""You've got to look at it from a different perspective,"" Abbajay said. ""They got the job for a reason. Try to learn what you can from them. Maybe they are afraid of making mistakes in a new position.""Don't gossip about your boss' failings or your prowess. Make your boss look good instead. Most people know who the competent people in the organization are; you want to look like a team player that can be trusted.

929,KEY,"Several years ago China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) set out on a path to change the face of retailing. Billions of dollars and several acquisitions later, you could say it's well on its way to accomplishing its mission.XIt started in 2014, when the Amazon (AMZN) of China paid $692 million for a stake in department store chain and mall operator Intime Retail Group, in a move to digitize brick-and-mortar department stores. A year later Alibaba paid $4.6 billion for a 20% stake in Sunning, an electronics retailer with 1,600 outlets. The company then forked over $2.9 billion for a 36% stake in Hong Kong-based Sun Art Retail. It's the largest operator of supermarkets in China, with about 446 stores in 224 cities.The company didn't stop there. Early last year it shelled out $2.6 billion to acquire the rest of Intime it didn't already own. During this same period Alibaba was building its own chain of brick-and-mortar supermarkets, called Hema. There, consumers have a variety of options on how they shop.Its ""New Retail"" strategy integrates e-commerce and conventional retailing in an effort to boost sales and convenience. Similar to Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, Alibaba believes a foothold in traditional retail is the path to future growth.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Our New Retail initiatives are substantially growing Alibaba's total addressable market in commerce,"" said Joseph Tsai, Alibaba executive vice chairman, during the company's quarterly earnings conference call May 4. ""In retail, we are anticipating changing consumer behavior and increasing expectations of quality and convenience, whether these consumers shop online or in offline stores.""The New Retail phrase was coined by company founder Jack Ma more than two years ago.""The big prize for Alibaba in New Retail is modernizing the 'other 80%' of retail sales not yet online,"" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler said in a recent report to clients. ""This means redefining the entire process of conventional retail workflow.""That includes new marketing methods, pricing models, inventory management, and sourcing and supply-chain management.""We think this business will ultimately be as high a margin, or better than the existing marketplace model,"" Kessler said. Kessler has raised his price target on Alibaba stock to 300 from 250. That is more than 50% from where the stock currently trades.As an example, users with a Hema supermarket app hook up to Alibaba's e-commerce platform and payment system. They then can shop for groceries online and have them delivered or pick them up.Or they can order fresh food and have it prepared by Hema chefs. And they can pay for any of it using the Alibaba online payment platform Alipay.The idea is to draw customers deeper into Alibaba's consumer-facing ecosystem. Alibaba is already the largest e-commerce services provider in China and looks to leverage that to grow its brick-and-mortar business.""With this transformation, China's $5 trillion in retail sales will be available to Alibaba as our total addressable market,"" Tsai said.There are 47 Hema stores in 13 cities across China, with 14 added in the first quarter. While that's not quite the 400-plus Whole Foods outlets that Amazon gained in one fell swoop with its $13.7 billion deal, Alibaba says its pace will accelerate.Part of the overall strategy involves attracting customers online, then directing them to physical stores and service centers. The partnerships also involve companies working together on integrating e-commerce platforms and logistics, in part to provide speedier delivery or in-store pickup. And they often include exclusive partnerships with retailers and brands.Alibaba is also developing algorithms to analyze customer data. It looks at brand affiliation, purchasing history and even tracks store visit time. The idea is to better understand shopper preferences and predict changes in habits. The results can then be used to adjust product offerings. It can also help design fresh marketing campaigns as well as build faster supply chains.The company was founded in 1999 in Hangzhou, China, but didn't gain widespread recognition in the U.S. until its blockbuster initial public offering in September 2014. It was the largest IPO ever on U.S. markets, raising $25 billion, with shares priced at 68. Alibaba stock in the past 12 months is up more than 60%. Shares jumped another 3%, surging past a buy point of 201.60, and were near 204.40 at midday Friday on the stock market today.On May 4 Alibaba reported a 76% jump in quarterly revenue from the year-ago period to $9.9 billion, up 76% from the year-ago quarter and 61% higher in local currency. That's its strongest growth in more than four years. Adjusted earnings rose 44% to 91 cents per share. Both revenue and earnings topped analyst estimates for the period ended March 31. The company expects revenue growth for fiscal year 2019 to exceed 60%, or more than 50% excluding acquired companies.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Hans Chung expects the company's new retail initiatives to be the key driver of revenue growth in fiscal 2019. Chung raised his price target on Alibaba to 235 from 219.Alibaba ended the quarter with 617 million monthly active users on mobile devices. That's up 6%, or 37 million, from the previous quarter.Needham analyst Kerry Rice attributed the better-than-expected revenue growth to Alibaba's New Retail initiative.There's another aspect to Alibaba's New Retail strategy, and that's food delivery.In April, Alibaba said it would acquire the shares that it did not already own in Ele.me, also a food-delivery company.""We believe the transaction is highly strategic to the company's new retail strategy as Ele.me's local service and food delivery network significantly strengthens Alibaba's last-mile delivery,"" wrote Rice.Alibaba and its affiliate, Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group, invested $1.25 billion in Ele.me in 2016.It also has expanded into multiple facets of the digital economy. That includes digital entertainment and movies, financial services and cloud computing, among other businesses.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Alibaba Listing In China Would Fuel New Opportunities For InvestorsAlibaba Plans $15.2 Billion Investment In Logistics, DeliveryChina Internets Pump Billions In Online To OfflineBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And Watch

932,KEY,"Boeing (BA) may have just received a huge publicity boost for its upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet, after Tom Cruise tweeted a photo from the set of the ""Top Gun"" sequel.XThe photo shows Cruise, who played Maverick in the first ""Top Gun"" movie, in front of what appears to be a Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, instead of the Navy version of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.Boeing didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The Navy told CNN that it provided Paramount Pictures access to Naval Air Station North Island in Coronado, Calif., for the filming of ""Top Gun: Maverick.""David Evans, with the Defense Department's entertainment media office, told IBD that it's ""too soon to tell"" which aircraft will be used in the film based on just the draft script DoD has seen. He said Paramount will deliver a final script ""sometime in the future."" The film is slated for release in July 2019.The F-14 Tomcat was the star of the original ""Top Gun"" but has since been retired. The absence of Lockheed's F-35 in the sequel would be notable, as it is the more cutting-edge fighter with stealth technology and will represent the backbone of the overall U.S. fighter fleet for decades to come.But the Navy's variant of the F-35 won't be combat ready until the end of the year, while the Super Hornets are in service today. (Marine Corps and Air Force versions of the F-35 are in service.)#Day1 pic.twitter.com/7jjPL277Es— Tom Cruise (@TomCruise) May 31, 2018Mackenzie Eaglen, a national security analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, said she had talked to the companies early in the Trump Administration about ""Top Gun"" and was told Lockheed had been in talks about using the F-35 for the movie.""So something happened,"" she told IBD Thursday. ""What that tells me is there was a competition behind the scenes between the two companies.""Lockheed didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Meanwhile, Boeing's public relations boost won't just help with domestic audiences. The movie could help bring in more foreign sales of the F/A-18 as well.In April, Boeing secured a $1.16 billion contract for 28 F/A-18 Super Hornets from the Kuwait Air Force.But Eaglen thinks the movie will have little effect on any one defense contractor or contract. Instead, it will likely help boost public support for increased military spending after a huge bump in the fiscal 2018 and 2019 budgets.Still, Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, believes being included in the ""Top Gun"" sequel is good marketing.He also thinks the decision may indicate which aircraft the Navy feels is emblematic of the service.""Most interesting angle is the Navy mind set,"" he said in an interview.

934,KEY,"President Donald Trump reversed course again on Thursday and now plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. This Trump trade war threat, which tanked the stock market in late February and early March, pressured the Dow Jones Thursday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1% on the stock market today, finding support so far at its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 slipped 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite dipped 0.3%.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe EU said it would impose 25% tariffs on $3.3 billion worth of U.S. imports starting June 20. Mexico also announced plans to strike back by imposing tariffs on pork bellies, apples, grapes, cheeses and flat steel. Canada announced retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel, aluminum and a variety of other products.The Trump administration faced a decision with previously granted exemptions from the tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports expiring June 1. Even though the exemptions have covered more than half of steel imports, steel prices have moved higher this year. U.S. prices for steel are already about 50% higher than those in Europe and China, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement opposing any expansion of tariffs or quotas.""Such a move would hit American manufacturers with higher costs, slow the growth of the U.S. construction sector, and put the brakes on job creation in both of these key industries,"" the Chamber said.Hitting Canada and Mexico with the tariffs could be a huge blow to Nafta talks. There's little logic in imposing tariffs on metal imports from the Nafta partners. Canada is the biggest steel exporter to the U.S., shipping 5.8 million metric tons in 2017, or about 16% of total steel imports. Yet Canada is also, far and away, the largest export market for U.S. steel makers, so its retaliatory tariffs will hurt. Through the first three quarters of 2017, the U.S. ran a relatively minor trade deficit with Canada of about a half-million metric tons, according to Department of Commerce data.Trump's move to broaden tariffs on metal imports follows news earlier this week that the Trump administration is preparing to hit China with tariffs on $50 billion worth of mainly high-tech imports as initially planned. That came as a surprise after China-U.S. trade talks appeared close to a deal for China to significantly increase purchases of U.S. energy and agricultural goods.Last week, Trump ordered the Commerce Department to conduct a national security investigation into foreign auto imports. He's said to be considering 25% tariffs on $176 billion yearly imports. News reports say that Trump is determined to keep German luxury cars out of the U.S.For the past couple of months, it has looked like a trade war might be avoided, Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, wrote in a note distributed early Thursday morning. But he said he was ready to throw in the towel on that assessment.

936,KEY,"Federal Reserve officials said the economic outlook warranted another interest-rate hike ""soon"" and signaled they would welcome a modest overshoot of their 2% inflation target, indicating they're in no rush to tighten more aggressively.X""Most participants judged that if incoming information broadly confirmed their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate for the committee to take another step in removing policy accommodation,"" minutes released Wednesday of the Federal Open Market Committee's May 1-2 meeting said.A temporary period of inflation ""modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the committee's symmetric inflation objective and could be helpful in anchoring longer-run inflation expectations,"" according to the minutes.While the report all but confirms the central bank is track to raise interest rates at their next meeting in June, Fed officials were reluctant to declare victory on achieving their inflation goal on a sustainable basis. At the same time, they flagged potential changes to the statement at future meetings to indicate rates were no longer as stimulative, and discussed adjustments in the rate of interest on excess bank reserves to relieve some pressures in the money markets.""It was noted that it was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around 2 percent, especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the committee's 2 percent objective,"" the minutes said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt the meeting, U.S. central bankers left the target range for the benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1.5% to 1.75% after raising rates in March, and inserted a second reference to their ""symmetric"" 2% inflation goal in the policy statement on their decision.Investors had already widely expected officials to raise rates when the FOMC meets June 12-13, according to interest-rate futures prices. Policy makers have been split on whether a total of three or four hikes are warranted for the full year.Financial markets were unsettled in the days running up to the May FOMC meeting amid concerns over a U.S.-China trade dispute, with stock prices falling and 10-year Treasury yield rising toward 3%.President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on as much as $150 billion in Chinese imports, with China vowing to retaliate in kind. While the nations announced a truce over the weekend, Trump has since said he wasn't pleased with the trade negotiations, and tweeted Wednesday that the U.S. may need to change the direction of talks to get a final agreement.Policy makers relayed concerns from regional business contacts who warned of possible adverse effects from tariffs and trade restrictions, such as delays or pullbacks in capital spending.In addition, ""it was noted that the potential for higher Chinese tariffs on key agricultural products could, in the longer run, hurt U.S. competitiveness.""The minutes showed officials discussed the flattening yield curve, or the shrinking gap between the yields on long-dated Treasury bonds and short-term securities. That spread -- which turned negative in the run-up to every recession in the past 40 years -- has recently narrowed to around the lowest levels since 2007.While a few policy makers said the yield curve may have become ""a less reliable signal of future economic activity,"" several others stressed that an inverted yield curve has historically ""indicated an increased risk of recession,"" according to the minutes.Fed officials met after data showed price gains finally hitting their target after undershooting for most of the last few years. New York Fed President William Dudley and San Francisco's John Williams, who'll replace him next month, have both since said they're comfortable with a modest inflation overshoot, signaling no rush to speed up the central bank's gradual pace of policy tightening.Inflation, according to the Fed's preferred indicator, reached 2% in March. Data released two days after the meeting showed unemployment dipped in April to 3.9%, the lowest since 2000, while year-over-year gains in average hourly earnings were steady at 2.6%.Officials largely viewed the economy as in good shape and anticipated that the first-quarter slowdown in consumer spending would prove temporary, according to the report. A few policy makers ""emphasized the need to build additional resilience in the financial sector at this point in the economic expansion,"" the minutes said, while noting that ""leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector remained elevated.""Separately, Fed policy makers backed potentially making a ""small technical adjustment"" of setting the interest on excess reserves, or IOER, rate ""modestly below"" the top of the federal funds target range to help keep the effective fed funds rate ""well within"" range.""Many participants judged that it would be useful to make such a technical adjustment sooner rather than later,"" the minutes said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Best Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

937,KEY,"Scandalous Media Bias: There have been two major ongoing investigations involving President Trump. One is looking into whether Trump colluded with Russia. It's borne no fruit. The other involves abuse of power at the highest levels of government to hurt Trump and is producing damning evidence by the bushel. Guess which one the press is ignoring?National Review reporter John Fund relates an interesting story. He was waiting to go on the air and struck up a conversation with another prominent reporter in the network's green room.Why, he asked, aren't reporters actively investigating the suspicious activities at the Justice Department and the FBI regarding the Trump/Russia and Hillary/email investigations?Fund says the reporter ""bluntly told me 'There's only room for one narrative on all this. And it's all about Trump.' ""You might think that reporters are chasing facts wherever they might lead, and ""speaking truth to power,"" especially when that power involves the CIA, FBI and Justice Department.Instead, it's all about the ""narrative.""And when it comes to the Russia story, the only narrative the press will consider is that Trump somehow colluded with Russia to steal the election from Hillary Clinton. Or if not that, he did something illegal or improper that Special Counsel Robert Mueller will ferret out.Anything that doesn't fit this narrative gets dismissed as conspiracy talk, fueled by conservatives and Trump supporters, to distract attention from the ""real"" story.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHere's how Vox.com — a site putatively devoted to ""explaining"" the news — put it:""Trump and his allies, most notably House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes as well as major conservative media outlets, have long sought to create a counternarrative to the Russia scandal.""But even Vox's attempt to dismiss this ""counternarrative"" shows why it's very real and troubling. As it says, the threads involve ""criticism of the FBI's use of the Steele dossier, a focus on text messages exchanged between two key FBI officials, and the Nunes memo's argument that Carter Page was a victim of 'FISA abuse.' "" Vox doesn't bother to mention the Clinton email scandal.While Mueller has turned up no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, this ""counternarrative"" has led to: former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe fired for lying to investigators; Peter Strzok and Lisa Page booted off Mueller's team for virulently anti-Trump texts; Deputy Assistant AG Bruce Ohr demoted after contacts with a Trump oppo-research firm came to light; the quitting of former Deputy Assistant AG David Laufman, who played a key role in both the Russia and Clinton email investigations; and FBI general counsel James Baker reassigned after evidence emerged that he'd been in contact with leftist reporter David Corn.In other words, while the Mueller investigation sputters along, the evidence of political abuse at the FBI and Justice is piling up.This ""counternarrative"" also has uncovered the fact that the FBI had a spy in the Trump campaign, and that the FBI has not been entirely forthcoming about how the Trump investigation got started, or when.Alan Dershowitz — by no means a Trump ally — said over the weekend that the revelation that the FBI had an informant in the Trump campaign is ""worth investigation."" (To which ABC News' George Stephanopoulos responded: ""It sounds like you're in league with President Trump on impeaching the credibility at this point of the special counsel."")It's also worth pointing out that while Trump officials have been, by most accounts, reasonably forthcoming with the Mueller investigation, congressional inquiries into the FBI's handling of the Clinton email and Russia probes have been, and still are being, met with stonewalling by government officials.Even some Democrats are starting to notice that the ""counternarrative"" deserves more attention that it's getting.""The full origins of the (Trump/Russia) investigation and its lack of any real intelligence needs to come out in the open,"" wrote former Clinton administration pollster Mark Penn in an op-ed — titled ""Stopping Robert Mueller to protect us all"" — published by The Hill on Monday.Yet the press still shows only grudging interest, at best, in any of this because it doesn't fit their anti-Trump narrative.It reminds us of the story about the cub reporter who is sent to cover a routine meeting of the local town council. The reporter later returns to the newsroom without a story. When the editor asks why there's no story, the reporter responds: ""I couldn't get to the government building because a massive train wreck blocked the street.""A good reporter, or at least one who isn't hopelessly biased, would be able to see that the real story isn't the go-nowhere Mueller investigation, but the more troubling story of abuse of power by Obama administration officials to protect Hillary Clinton and then derail the Trump presidency. YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Spying On Trump: Was Obama Behind CIA, FBI Plan To Elect Hillary?FBI Scandal: Deep State Corruption Of FBI, Justice Was There From Very Start Of Hillary Email ProbeMueller's Leak: Deep State Doubles Down On Collusion With DemocratsComey's Memos Reveal How He Repeatedly Lied To Trump

The Dow transports jumped more than 1.2% on Monday, beating a 0.7% advance by the S&P 500 and a 0.5% rise by the Nasdaq composite.Weekend comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicating that the U.S. and China will work to settle differences over bilateral trade issues gave stocks the initial spark they needed. The Nasdaq, which eased nearly 0.7% last week, gained as much as 1.1% intraday before cooling off.Meanwhile, the continued positive breadth of the market could be witnessed by the fact that three companies in three separate sectors continued to build a case for a potential breakout: Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), farm machinery giant Deere (DE) and HR management software expert Workday (WDAY).The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, held most of the day's gains as it closed more than 1% higher. At least eight of the Dow industrials' 30 components rallied 1 point or more, including manufacturing heavyweights Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX).Volume rose on the Nasdaq vs. Friday, which saw the expiration of monthly stock and index options. But turnover declined on the NYSE, based on early data.Caterpillar is building the right side of a new shallow base that began with a 173.24 peak notched in mid-January.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock bounced nicely off its 200-day moving average on May 3, then retook its key medium-term 50-day moving average nearly two weeks ago. For now, the correct entry is 173.34, a dime above the base's left side high.Also within the Dow, struggling General Electric (GE) staged its eighth gain in 10 sessions to 15.25 on news that the blue-chip firm will merge its locomotive operations with Wabtec (WAB).GE has been in a sharp downtrend since December 2016. The stock has recently rebounded back above the 50-day line but still lies 48% beneath its 52-week high of 29.47.Alphabet has been locked in a four-month trading range of 1,000 to 1,200. The stock needs to put more work in developing the right side of a new base in order to set up a potential breakout.The Mountain View, Calif.-based megacap tech was the subject of a ""60 Minutes"" CBS TV show on Sunday that interviewed some industry observers and players charging that the Google search engine engages in anticompetitive behavior through its online search results.The company has already been fined $2.7 billion by the European Union. That's less than 9% of the $31.15 billion in Alphabet's top line in the second quarter.Q2 earnings are seen rising just 9% to $9.69 a share, which would be the smallest year-over-year increase since a 7% EPS gain in the fourth quarter of 2016. Alphabet grew earnings per share by 28%, 27%, 32%, 28% and 28% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters.Deere, meanwhile, gained nearly 2% to 158.34 in brisk trading Monday, extending a rebound from a 131.26 year-to-date low to more than 20%. The stock is still in the early stages of carving the right side of a new base.Last week, the tractor and lawn-mower maker reported excellent results for the second quarter ended in April (EPS up 45%, revenue up 29% to $10.7 billion).Workday has sculpted a downward-slanting handle on its nine-week double-bottom-style base. The correct buy point is 138.75.The handle passes the midpoint test.While the Street sees April first-quarter earnings sinking 10% to 26 cents a share, keep in mind that in the year-ago quarter, earnings soared 383% to 29 cents.Workday's top line has seen vigorous growth. Revenue has jumped 39%, 32%, 35%, 36%, 38%, 41%, 34% and 33% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.RELATED:Which Stocks Just Joined IBD's Top Growth Stock Screens?

943,KEY,"SpyGate: Did the Obama administration spy on the Donald Trump campaign because it feared Russian hacking of the 2016 election? Or was it merely a smokescreen to cover up the real reason: to keep Trump from winning the presidency or take him down if he did?As the saying goes, timing is everything. Recent revelations keep pushing back the beginning of the CIA and FBI investigation into ""Russian hacking"" or ""meddling"" in the 2016 election further and further in time.This is significant, since the farther back in time the actual origin of the spying on Trump, the less likely it is that it had anything to do with Russian involvement in the 2016 elections, but everything to do with stopping the surprising surge of Trump during the GOP primaries and beyond.Increasingly, a political motive seems not only likely, but almost certain.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn a recent piece that warrants a thorough reading, Andrew C. McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney who now writes for the National Review, painstakingly dismantles the multiple lies told about how and when the spying on Trump began.There is what he calls ""The Original Origination Story"" that involves little-known Trump adviser Carter Page. He visited Moscow in July 2016, three months after hooking on to the Trump campaign.According to former MI6 British spy Christopher Steele's now infamous dossier on Trump, Page's trip was when the alleged Trump-Russia plan to hack the Democratic National Committee was born.The only problem is, the Steele dossier has been exposed as a fanciful product of the Clinton campaign and the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which hired Steele. And the main assertions were based on hearsay from Russian officials, and never validated.Even so, the FBI and Justice Department used the dossier to apply to the FISA court to tap Page's communications and, as a result, much of the rest of the Trump campaign.In doing so, the FBI broke its own rules and, worse, the Obama Justice Department withheld the fact from the FISA court that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee were responsible for the dossier.Then there was what McCarthy calls ""Origination Story 2.0.""This involves George Papadopoulos, a young, also little-known Trump aide. At a May 2016 meeting in a London pub, he told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer about an academic named Josef Mifsud with Kremlin ties who told Papadopoulos that the Kremlin had a huge number of emails that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton.Democrats point to this as proof that Trump had colluded to hack the DNC. But as McCarthy notes, there's a major flaw in that logic: ""If Russia already had the emails and was alerting the Trump campaign to that fact, the campaign could not have been involved in the hacking.""Moreover, Democrats insist Mifsud's comments about emails referred to the DNC emails that were, in fact, hacked by Russians.But that's not the case. Papadopoulos has said he thought Mifsud was talking about the more than 30,000 emails that Hillary Clinton ""accidentally"" had deleted from her illegal unsecured home email server.So if those didn't set up the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, what did?In fact, says McCarthy, the real origin of the investigation appears to have been in Spring of 2016, before Papadopoulos' conversation with the Australian ambassador in May and also before Page's visit to Moscow in July.It started with James Comey briefing President Obama's National Security Council about Carter Page, likely sometime in mid-Spring.Why? Well, both Page and Paul Manafort, another Trump adviser, had business ties to Russia, which, perhaps justifiably, concerned the FBI.But rather than telling the Trump campaign about their concerns, or even moving against the Russians, the Justice Department and the FBI starting treating Trump's campaign like a criminal enterprise.Instead of continuing to interview Page, or Manafort, or Papadopoulos, they inserted a spy, Stefan Halper, in the campaign, and tapped its phones. It had the earmarks of a political hit, not an actual investigation.As for the CIA, another line of inquiry finds they also were busy early on pursuing Trump.George Neumayr, writing in The American Spectator, notes that CIA Director John Brennan used the flimsy excuse of a tip from the Estonian intelligence agency that Putin was giving money to the Trump campaign to form an ""inter-agency taskforce"" on supposed Trump-Russia collusion in 2016. It met at CIA headquarters, spy central.The Estonian tip didn't pan out, but the task force remained.""Both before and after the FBI's official probe began in late July 2016,"" wrote Neumayr, ""Brennan was bringing together into the same room at CIA headquarters a cast of Trump haters across the Obama administration whose activities he could direct — from Peter Strzok, the FBI liaison to Brennan, to the doltish (Director of National Intelligence) Jim Clapper, Brennan's errand boy, to an assortment of Brennan's buddies at the Treasury Department, Justice Department, and White House.""It eventually led, on July 31, 2016, to the creation FBI's ""Crossfire Hurricane"" program to spy against the Trump campaign.What we're discovering is that the investigations and spying on the Trump campaign for evidence of possible collusion with Russia appear to have begun well before the CIA and FBI said they did.And it all arose from progressive, pro-Hillary embeds deep within the Deep State and at the top of key Obama agencies, people who could use their positions of supposed Olympian objectivity to mask their political bias — and to ignore years of evidence that Hillary Clinton had colluded with the Russians for her own financial benefit.As McCarthy concluded: ""The Trump-Russia investigation did not originate with Page or Papadopoulos. It originated with the Obama administration.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Russia Investigation: 3 Ways Democrats Confirmed GOP Claims Of AbuseRussia Scandal: Did Hillary Clinton Run FBI's Trump Investigation?Justice, FBI Russia-Trump Investigation Just Got Even More Corrupt — Why Does It Continue?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

953,KEY,"Apple (AAPL) nudged stock futures narrowly higher in Wednesday's premarket trading, after a solid fiscal second-quarter report late Tuesday, and ahead of Wednesday's policy rate decision from the Fed.Apple scaled up nearly 3% in premarket trading, helping boost all three indexes' futures. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones industrials inched up to fractional gains. Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) posted one of the session's heaviest declines.Apple narrowly cleared analysts' sales and earnings targets. The iPhone maker also boosted its June-quarter revenue guidance, ratcheted up its quarterly dividend by 16% and launched a $100 billion share-buyback initiative.IPhone sales fell just short of expectations during the quarter, rising less than 3% year-over-year to 52.2 million. Apple shares have been locked in consolidations since late January. The current consolidation is a flat base with a 183.60 buy point, and an alternative entry at 179.04. Apple's after-hours gain Tuesday implied an open back above the stock's 50-day moving average and 2% below the base's alternative entry. Stock moves made in extended or premarket trading do not necessarily carry through into the regular session.Apple led the Dow, with Caterpillar (CAT) and General Electric (GE) each up more than 1%. Early declines were mild, holding to less than 0.5%.Among the fastest-rising issues in premarket action, Community Health Systems (CYH) and Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) each vaulted 5% higher.

954,KEY,"An ongoing truckers strike that has brought Brazil to a standstill has taken on the economy and spooked investors. Some of the South American country's top U.S.-listed stocks have been pounded. They include Petrobras (PBR), which faces its own labor action this week, mining giant Vale (VALE) and PagSeguro Digital (PAGS). Meanwhile exchange traded funds such as iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) and Direxion Daily Brazil Bull 3X Shares (BRZU) have also dived.The state-owned oil giant has been hit by a double whammy as the nine-day-old truckers strike has paralyzed transport across the biggest economy in Latin America. The government, in a bid to placate truckers, has offered diesel fuel price cuts that would hit Petrobras' profit.In addition, the state-controlled company's management faces a strike of its own on Wednesday.""How can Petrobras and its workers better help Brazil at this moment?

It gapped down for the second time in the space of three trading session Tuesday, a move which saw it crash through its 200-day line, a key technical support.The company is far from an ideal CAN SLIM stock, with a poor IBD Composite Rating of just 48.The Brazilian mining giant, which also happens to be one of the country's biggest logistics operators, is being affected by the traffic chaos as well.The stock fell 4.3% to 13.43. Vale has undercut its 14.28 buy point recently and is approaching its 50-day line.While the stock boasts an impressive Relative Strength Rating, there are warning signs around the stock. Most alarming is its EPS Rating, which stands at a dire 11. The proprietary rating is a quick way to identify stocks with the strongest profit growth. It takes into account the growth and stability of a company's earnings over the past three years, with extra weighting put on the most recent two quartersThe e-commerce payment service company had been showing resilience, and actually managed to punch through its 50-day line last week.However the stock tanked 10.1% to 31.83 Tuesday. The move caused it to plunge through its 50-day line once more, while its relative strength line also took a sharp downward turn. The January IPO has been noticeably volatile and is far from a 38.90 correct entry point as it builds an aesthetically challenged 8-week double bottom base.Despite its volatility on the charts, the stock still boasts strong fundamentals. It has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 96, which puts it in the top 3% of stocks, and it scores an A in the SMR Rating.

955,KEY,"Investors whacked stocks in the S&P 500 (down 1.2%) and the Dow Jones industrial average (off 1.6%) on Tuesday as financial markets fretted over the political situation in Italy and the risk that a new election in the third largest economy within the eurozone could have implications for the future of the key currency.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite suffered a smaller loss, down 0.5%. It continues to be the top index. At 7398, it's risen more than 7% since Jan. 1.However, the 500 remains on track for a solid gain in May.

Yet computer and semiconductor-related stocks mostly held firm, and a few even broke out.Micron Technology (MU) vaulted more than 4.2% at one point and hit a new high of 63.98. At that price, the data storage play briefly topped the 63.52 entry in a cup without handle.In a cup without handle, the decline from head to toe should not exceed 33%.

Watch to see if the stock can keep rising and cross back above the long-term 200-day moving average.Applied produced prodigious gains after it broke out of giant first-stage cup with handle at 21.77 in mid-May of 2016.

958,KEY,"Rising fuel costs could bring ""a significant shakeout"" in the airline industry in the months ahead, Ryanair (RYAAY) CEO Michael O'Leary said, potentially affecting one of the biggest discount-airfare competitors to Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) over the Atlantic.XThe speed of that shakeout, he told Bloomberg Television, will determine future profitability. Among the ""key issues"" for the next 12 months, he said, was the fate of low-cost, long-haul carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle.Norwegian is among the carriers that early last year threatened to push profits lower for the big three U.S. carriers in the trans-Atlantic market. Norwegian is currently offering one-way flights, scheduled in December, from Oakland, Calif., to London for as little as $144.90.O'Leary said Norwegian was ""hugely loss-making last year with oil at $40 a barrel."" And he said that the carrier's fortunes could worsen dramatically at $80 a barrel. Norwegian told Bloomberg that O'Leary's remarks had ""no root in reality.""Some airlines may find themselves in trouble as soon as this winter, he said, adding that the loss of Norwegian as a competitor could allow others to raise airfare more easily. A rescue of some kind by British Airways parent IAG would be less to his liking, as it might only slow capacity growth.IAG has taken close to a 5% stake in Norwegian. The company has tried twice, unsuccessfully, to take over Norwegian. IAG reportedly plans to make a third attempt.O'Leary said his carrier was ""well-hedged"" on fuel prices for the next 12 months, and was 90% hedged at around $59 a barrel.Shares of Ryanair jumped 4.9% in the stock market today, rebounding above their 200-day line. Delta was up 2%, surfacing above its 50-day line. American rose 2.1%, while United gained 2.4%. Sales have rebounded internationally for the big three recently. But beyond Europe, one analyst warned the U.S.' exit from the Iran nuclear deal could pose a ""material risk"" to airline profits.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut O'Leary's remarks came as Ryanair deals with higher oil and labor costs. Lower airfare brought by a crowded market, along with higher oil prices, led the Ireland-based discount carrier on Monday to forecast weaker profits vs. last year's. For the year ahead, Ryanair said it was on the ""pessimistic side of cautious.""The carrier said it sees full-year net income of 1.25 billion to 1.35 billion euros, less than the 1.45 billion euros for last year.Ryanair said it sees non-fuel unit costs up 6%, following pay increases to pilots and other staff. Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, in a research note, called that ""the biggest surprise.""The carrier has also had to come to the negotiating table after struggling with a shortage of pilots.""We expect above-average EU capacity growth to continue into (fiscal 2019), which will have a downward effect on fares,"" the carrier said in an earnings release on Monday.But Ryanair expects some upward pressure on airfare later in the year ""as significantly higher oil prices impact margins, especially those EU airlines (that) continue to expand despite having no prospect of achieving profitability.""Syth, in a research note earlier this month, indicated optimism about the carrier.""We remain constructive on Ryanair's competitive positioning and earnings potential, particularly in a rising fuel price environment that should place increasing pressure on weaker competitors,"" she said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:United Airlines Expansion Plan That Caused Stock Meltdown Gets SupportStock Upgrades: Delta Airlines Shows Rising Relative StrengthAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

961,KEY,"How far will interest rates go up? Wall Street cannot make up its mind.Will the Federal Reserve reveal a more hawkish view on inflation and go for four rate hikes this year? Or will the U.S. central bank continue to adopt its steady approach and stick with just a quarter-point jump in both June and September?The futures market, at one point this past week, reflected a greater than 50% chance that the Fed will raise the Fed funds rate by another quarter point in December. That would push the rate to a 2.25%-2.5% range by year's end. But on Friday that probability dipped below 50%. Institutional trading desks focused a little more on U.S.-China trade issues, the powerful rebound in crude oil prices, and what impact a stronger U.S. dollar could have on the global economy.""We're probably in a more balanced position relative to where interest rates have been. They've now normalized short-term rates. QE (quantitative easing) is going away,"" Rich Familetti, president and CIO of New York-based LDI (liability-driven investing) expert Ryan Labs Asset Management, told IBD in an interview. The company also focuses on total return strategies in fixed income. ""It's common to see 100 basis points up or down (in rates) in any one year.""Familetti added he thinks the Fed would ""not risk a policy error"" by acting overly aggressive in raising the cost of money to prevent raging inflation. The reason: pushing rates up too fast increases the risk of putting a hard brake on the economy. But he's watching carefully for those sectors that have used more debt than the value of their assets or are showing cash flows that are not as stable as they may appear.No doubt, in a rising-rate environment, Wall Street has made up its mind about those sectors that normally carry a lot of loans on the balance sheet or may see declining business due to the new shift in the monetary cycle. Just look at the utility sector, which as of Thursday ranked dead last among the 33 sectors that make up IBD's stock research tables.Homebuilding stocks, meanwhile, still seem to have the flu.Familetti's team looks at debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). IBD's method? See the ratio of long-term debt to shareholders' equity. In general, avoid companies that carry a ratio of more than 100%. That limit fluctuates depending on the industry and other factors.Within the IBD 50 through Thursday, seven companies (14% of the list) had a calculable debt-to-equity ratio topping 100%. The seven firms are Zebra Technology (ZBRA) (261% in 2017), LPL Financial (LPLA), Smart Global (SGH), Integra LifeSciences (IART), Netflix (NFLX), TransUnion (TRU), and PGT Innovations (PGTI). The median D-to-E ratio in IBD 50 firms: 28%.Of course, some firms belong to capital-intensive industries. So if the operating cash is robust, the fundamentals are likely sound. Consider Zebra. The inventory-tracking technology firm posted operating cash flow of $8.57 a share in 2017, above the $7.05 it earned in profits per share. In 2013, Zebra had cash flow of $3.38 a share and EPS of $2.85.You can check the debt-to-equity ratio for any company by seeing the fundamental data block on the weekly chart in MarketSmith, IBD's premium stock charting and screening service.Trade the IBD 50 efficiently via the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital.

That's good news for Tesla (TSLA) and other luxury brands that don't make cars in China.Pure Storage topped first-quarter estimates, but still fell. Micron Technology, up sharply Monday on raised guidance, announced an Intel (INTC) deal and a big buyback after the close. In addition to its own repurchase plan, Adobe said it will buy Magento, a key rival to e-commerce software firm Shopify, which tumbled. SailPoint Technologies slid on a follow-on stock offering.The stocks are generally highly rated. Adobe enjoys a 98 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

963,KEY,"Donald Trump is now deep into trade negotiations with China and NAFTA 2.0 negotiations with Canada and Mexico. We are strong free traders, but we believe that Trump's plans to negotiate better trade agreements that reduce trade barriers abroad are right on the mark. He also has to make sure those deals fully protect U.S. intellectual property, or what is commonly called know-how.American investments, ingenuity and entrepreneurship have made intellectual property one of our nation's most important assets. IP-intensive industries, including software, biotechnology and entertainment, now support nearly one-third of all U.S. jobs. But too often, our foreign trading partners take unfair advantage of our IP innovations to enrich themselves at our expense.This is glaringly evident in the pharmaceutical sector.American pharmaceutical companies are the runaway global leaders in developing new prescription drugs. This requires massive outlays of capital. A 2014 Tufts study estimated the cost of developing and bringing a prescription drug to market at $2.6 billion. These eye-popping R&D investments that U.S. pharma makes in new medications are especially important in biologics, the revolutionary class of drugs that holds great promise in addressing some of our most serious health challenges, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and more.Making those huge outlays of shareholders' money becomes harder to justify when foreign companies reap the benefits. U.S. law requires 12 years of exclusivity for new biologic medicines. In Canada, those same drugs are protected for only eight years; and Mexico, in some cases, provides no protection at all unless drug manufacturers are willing to go through an expensive legal process.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump's trade negotiators need assurances from our trading partners that these drugs and vaccines are not stolen and that American companies are paid a fair price for the lifesaving drugs they have worked to bring to market. Holding Mexico, Canada and China to the same legal standards we abide by in the U.S. would save billions of dollars — money that can be reinvested in new research to produce even more innovative treatments.There is another reason why fair pricing of U.S. pharmaceuticals must be covered by negotiated trade deals, and it is related to Donald Trump's goal of reducing the costs paid by seniors and families for drugs and vaccines here at home.It is very simple: When other nations impose price controls on American-produced prescription drugs (and threaten to steal the patents and produce the drugs themselves if these companies don't comply), it means that American consumers pay higher prices here at home to cover the R&D costs. This is unfair to American consumers. It is one reason our health care costs are higher than other nations'.So rather than imposing price controls here at home, which would severely slow the development of new lifesaving drugs, we should shut down the price controls abroad as a key condition of new trade deals.The theft of American intellectual property has been going on for years with impunity, and now it's the elephant in the room of trade deals. The United States Trade Representative estimates that the IP thievery perpetrated by China alone costs us between $225 billion and $600 billion each year. China also accounts for a major share of stolen U.S. trade secrets. That costs us another $180 billion to $540 billion annually. Millions of U.S. jobs are lost because of the unfair trade practices routinely employed by China and other countries.Intellectual property is every bit as vital to our economy — if not more so — than steel or aluminum. America leads the world in computer software; drugs; artificial intelligence; patents; trademarks; and music, entertainment and other creative industries. But how long can that last when competitor nations are ripping off our entrepreneurial companies to the tune of half a trillion dollars a year?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

965,KEY,"President Trump trumpeted his administration's temporary trade truce with China on Monday. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rallied, but the Dow Jones industrial average led the way. Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM), along with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Deere (DE), all should benefit from easing tensions between the world's two largest economies.Meanwhile U.S. Steel (X) and other domestic steel stocks took a hit, even though Chinese steel makes up a small share of U.S. steel imports.The aerospace giant is America's biggest exporter and China is a key customer. China's jet purchases could reach a worth of $1.1 trillion over the next 20 years. A U.S.-China trade war could have been damaging to the Dow Jones aerospace giant.Boeing shares rose 3.6%, to close at 363.92, on the stock market today. Boeing cleared a 56-day cup with handle base with a 348.67 buy point on Friday, MarketSmith analysis shows. But Boeing's breakout volume was light and the handle didn't appear on a weekly chart. Monday's gain is encouraging, but investors could choose to wait for a 371.70 cup-base entry.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBack in April, Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said the Boeing threat was ""dissipating"" due to Chinese and American policymakers seeking to avoid a trade war, with a mutually beneficial outcome. He noted that China's proposed 25% tariffs on aerospace products would only impact imports of Boeing's 737-700 and MAX 7. They account for less than 1% of Boeing's backlog orders.NXP Semiconductors stock rose 3.3%, to finish at 114.65, as a trade deal increases the chances its takeover by Qualcomm will go through. The stock gapped above its 50-day moving average and hit its 200-day line before retreating.The Dutch company already had climbed on reports that Chinese regulators are looking more favorably upon Qualcomm's attempt to acquire the chipmaker. That came after President Trump signaled he would ease stiff sanctions vs. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE.Analysts have said completing the $44 billion NXP transaction is Qualcomm's most pressing near-term issue. The deal was first announced in October 2016.San Diego-based Qualcomm also risked fallout from its status as a major supplier in China.Qualcomm shares initially rallied but pulled back fractionally as the chip giant likely will go ahead with its hefty NXP takeover.Other semiconductor firms with a big China presence include Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron (MU).Caterpillar has been investing heavily in China as it competes in the world's largest construction- and mining-equipment market.Last year the firm announced a five-year pact with China Energy Investment tied to mining-equipment sales and rentals in the future. It is also hoping to cash in on the country's ""Belt and Road"" initiative. The $1 trillion infrastructure spree builds on old Silk Road trading routes and spans Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Caterpillar stock rose 2.1% to 158.92, hitting its best levels intraday since late February. The Dow Jones stock is working on a consolidation with a buy point of 173.34.The Dow Jones industrial average firm, which makes thin coatings and many other industrial products in addition to Post-its and Scotch tape, made 10% of its sales from China last year.3M stock rose 1.4% to 201.76, but has plunged in recent months, hit by a weak earnings report.The stock also has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 35 and an abysmal relative strength rating of 17.The farm equipment giant has invested significantly in China, and risked a big drop in demand at home from Chinese tariffs and bans of U.S. agricultural products. Back in April China said it would slap tariffs on $50 billion worth of American imports, including soybeans, wheat, corn, cotton and other agricultural commodities. China imported $14 billion worth of soybeans from the U.S. last year.Deere stock rose 2% to 158.33. The stock has been building a cup base for the past 13 weeks and is shooting for a 175.36 entry point. Deere shot up 5.75% Friday on its quarterly earnings report.In every trade war there are winners and losers, and steel seemed to be a big winner when the Trump Administration slapped a 25% tariff on imported steel and a 10% tariff on imported aluminum.But the Trump administration has made several exemptions and postponements on those tariffs. The China trade truce suggests that the Trump administration is likely to settle for relatively modest achievements rather than carry out full-blown trade wars.U.S. Steel fell 3.8%, with Steel Dynamics (STLD) slipping 0.8% and AK Steel (AKS) tumbling 5.1%.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED INBoeing Falls As China Hits Aviation, But 737 Orders Roll In; GE, United Tech Recover China Trade War Sets Up These Winners, Losers As Agriculture Targeted The Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle How To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing System

969,KEY,"News reports, subsequently disputed by China, say Beijing is prepared to meet President Trump's request of ramping up American imports to the tune of $200 billion a year to avert a trade war. A deal could hit Friday with Chinese and U.S. negotiators meeting in Washington. But if that happens, don't expect an extended Wall Street celebration.Putting to rest the risk of a China trade war would be great news. Both sides have detailed plans for 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports. U.S. multinationals like Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL) face even bigger risks from possible nontariff hurdles to China's market. Boeing staged a low-volume breakout Friday while Caterpillar rose modestly. Apple edged lower, still near record highs.Yet Trump has been signaling for the past month that he has little interest in a trade war with China. If financial markets aren't really bracing for one, no big Dow Jones relief rally is likely. The bigger issue is that the trade deal that Trump is talking about appears likely to exacerbate all the concerns that have been pouring cold water on the stock market's latest rally attempt.A big increase in American exports to China — even one less than half the size of the supposed $200 billion deal — would be like yet-another injection of stimulus into an economy that's already at risk of overheating. A Trump-China trade deal would put more upward pressure on the dollar, on interest rates, on wages and on inflation.To dramatically cut its U.S. trade surplus, China would have to shift purchases from other foreign countries, economists say. Already the dollar has been rising because U.S. economic prospects and interest rates have firmed relative to those of other economies. Steering more business to the U.S. and less to other nations would hasten the trend.Trump's priorities appear to be focused on shrinking the China trade deficit and delivering near-term benefits to the U.S. economy. He also may be prioritizing the increasingly uncertain negotiations with North Korea, in which Beijing is seen as a key partner, over trade concerns.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Market Today: Why These Big Chips, This China Leader Tumble4 Reasons Why Soaring Treasury Yields Hit Stocks TodayDeere Earnings Miss Estimates Amid Rising Material, Freight CostsSeven Stocks Added To Stock Spotlight List — Even On A Down DayLooking For The Next Big Breakout Stocks?

The goal is to have 6,000 stores in the country, more than tripling revenue and more than doubling operating income there by the end of fiscal 2022 vs. 2017.""No Western company or brand is better positioned to evolve with the rapidly expanding Chinese middle class — and we continue to mindfully evolve a coffee culture in China where the reward will be healthy, long-term, profitable growth for decades to come,"" said Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson in a statement. ""We are committed to long-term investment in China.""That's not the first time Starbucks has ramped up its China plans. Less than two years ago, the chain created goals to lift its store count to 5,000 by 2021, which was already a slightly accelerated version of its previous targets.There are currently around 3,300 Starbucks locations in China, which means the company is looking to nearly double its overall store count over the next four years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

971,KEY,"Oil climbed for a second day on the back of Middle East tensions, but the rally was tempered by the outlook for growing shale production.Futures in New York settled 0.5% higher Tuesday, after earlier gaining as much as 1.4% to within pennies of $72 a barrel, while London-traded Brent spiked above $79 for the first time since 2014.The gap between the two benchmarks widened as a strengthening dollar and faltering equities also weakened U.S. oil's appeal, while its global counterpart remained supported by geopolitical risks.A large number of drilled-but-uncompleted wells in shale plays and the potential for rising output have weighed on American prices, said Walter Zimmermann, chief technical analyst at ICAP-TA. ""You are probably seeing some serious producer hedging into these lofty levels here, whereas I don't see anybody keen to hedge against Brent given these geopolitical fears.""Crude has rallied following President Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord and the re-imposition of sanctions.The key question now is whether other major crude producers will ramp up output to fill any gaps in Iranian exports.""Because crude oil tends to peak on Mideast fears in the spring, and because of this dramatic blowout of the WTI-Brent spread and because the stock market looks so dicey here, there are a list of reasons why any further upside will be unsustainable,"" said Zimmermann.West Texas Intermediate for June delivery rose 35 cents to $71.31 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

972,KEY,"Retailing, apparel, consumer-spending and semiconductor-related stocks dominated the market's upside in stocks today, as major indexes sought to beef up their morning gains. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), meanwhile, reaffirmed a new trend of emerging institutional demand within the restaurant industry group.Chipotle, which is a new trading idea in IBD SwingTrader on Wednesday, rallied more than 3% to 440.27 in healthy turnover for what figures to be its fourth up day in a row.Chipotle's volume is running 52% above usual levels, hinting that mutual funds, pensions, hedge funds, banks, insurers and the like are accumulating shares heavily.The stock ran in the short sellers on April 26 after reporting Q1 results that pointed to an ongoing turnaround in fundamentals. After that big jump, Chipotle traded tightly and volume dried up, forming a handle in the process. That positive action following the catapulting move in price in essence formed a handle and a 433.10 buy point within its new deep first-stage base.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite paced the key indexes with a gain of more than 0.7%. At 7405, the premier index of high-growth companies is now up 7.2% year to date. It advanced 28.2% last year.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF rallied 1.2% to 35.25. The exchange-traded fund, managed by Innovator Capital, gained 34% in 2017.The S&P 500 rose 0.5%. A two-point drop by 3M (MMM) hampered the Dow Jones industrial average's advance. The blue chip index rose around 0.3%. Volume is running around 7%-8% lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use3M has been hit with heavy institutional selling ever since the Dow Jones industrial component and manufacturing giant cracked below the 50-day moving average in severe volume on Feb. 5, a key sell signal.Some sector indexes heated up even more.The PHLX Semiconductor index, also known as the SOX, winged 1.1% higher. Micron Technology (MU) broke out of a new double-bottom base at 54.37 in decent but not great turnover.Notice how in this nine-week double bottom, the middle peak of 54.27 is actually 10 cents beneath the midpoint of the actual base (45.31 low plus 63.42, giving a base midpoint of 54.37). You'd prefer to see the midpoint of a double bottom be firmly lodged within the upper half of the base.That said, Micron is still 11% below the base's 63.42 peak. In other words, it's possible for the stock to continue building the right side of the current base. Double-bottom bases can also form handles, which represent a final shakeout of uncommitted shareholders, and boost the chances of a successful breakout.Micron is a member of the strong data storage industry group. In that group, Smart Global (SGH) continues to act as a market leader as well. Shares, up nearly 4% to 47.33, are working on the right side of a potential cup pattern.Returning to the restaurant group, Wingstop (WING) and Shake Shack (SHAK) are showing robust action so far in 2018.The former has made a series of rebounds off the 50-day moving average after it cleared a 33.64 buy point in a 10-week flat base on Nov. 3, 2017. On that day, the chicken wing chain reported a 31% jump in earnings to 17 cents a share for the third quarter of 2017 as sales lifted 19% to $26 million.Since then, earnings have risen 13% and 19% in the prior two quarters. In IBD Stock Checkup, Wingstop ranks 5th within the Retail-Restaurants industry group with an 87 Composite Rating. That overall ranking belies a solid EPS Rating of 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the company's long- and short-term profit growth is superior to 88% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database.Wingstop's Composite score is likely hurt by the fact that it doesn't have an SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity) Rating. Why? Wingstop does not have a calculable return on equity. As of the first quarter of 2018, the Dallas-based company showed a total stockholders' deficit of $146 million. Nonetheless, Wingstop posts excellent operating cash flow that has been higher than annual earnings per share for four years in a row.The Street sees Wingstop's earnings rising 14% to 83 cents a share this year and 19% to 99 cents in 2019.Shake Shack powered past a 44.50 buy point in a four-month cup with handle on April 13, then blasted higher nearly two weeks later after the popular burger, crinkle cut fries, and shake chain posted a 50% bulge in adjusted Q1 profit and a 29% increase in sales to $99.1 million.Wingstop and Shake Shack are small cap firms with market values of $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.In other markets, U.S. crude oil futures eased 0.3% to $71.08 a barrel. That decline didn't stop IBD 50 member Daqo New Energy (DQ) from rallying nearly 11% to 65.22 in hefty trade.The expert in making raw polysilicon for solar cell production is a wild stock, easily prone to swinging up or down 5% any given day.

978,KEY,"Canada will buy Kinder Morgan (KMI) Canada Ltd.'s Trans Mountain oil pipeline and its controversial expansion project for C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion) in a bid to ensure it gets built amid fierce opposition.XFinance Minister Bill Morneau and Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr announced the plan Tuesday in Ottawa. ""It must be built and it will be built,"" Morneau said. The deal, which includes the expansion, related pipeline and terminal assets, is expected to close in August. Construction will continue through the 2018 season, and the federal government will transfer it to one or more new owners when ""appropriate.""Buying the pipeline outright had become increasingly likely after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first pledged only to backstop it. ""We are going to get that pipeline built,"" Trudeau said Tuesday morning as he headed into a meeting with his cabinet.The purchase marks a stunning development for Trudeau's government -- effectively nationalizing the country's highest-profile infrastructure project until an operator can be found. The project has been beset by legal uncertainty and rising protests from environmental groups and the province of British Columbia. It will be a key test of Trudeau's bid to balance the environment and the economy by backing the C$7.4 billion pipeline expansion while pushing a national carbon price to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Canada first offered earlier this month to indemnify the expansion project before making Tuesday's announcement. The plan includes the existing pipeline that's been in operation since 1953.The plan announced Tuesday has several stages -- construction will continue this year with a Federal loan guarantee as the deal is finalized; the government will look for a new owner or owners to transfer the project to; and then ""indemnify"" the owner against certain costs.Calgary-based Kinder Morgan Canada, a unit of the Houston-based parent, was little changed at C$16.59 in Toronto trading Monday, for a market value of C$5.76 billion. Shares were halted on Tuesday pending the announcement, and the company was due to hold a call after Morneau announcement.The two sides had been in talks since the company set a May 31 deadline for the government to give certainty in the face of opposition from British Columbia, which is concerned about increased tanker traffic and possible oil spills along the Pacific coast. Trudeau pledges regularly that the pipeline will be built.The Trans Mountain expansion would almost triple capacity to 890,000 barrels of oil on a line running from Alberta to a terminal near Vancouver. The 980-kilometer (600-mile) expansion is seen by the oil industry as a crucial link to Asian markets, allowing producers to diversify away from the U.S., which takes the vast majority of Canadian oil exports.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry NewsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

983,KEY,"Looking for ways to cut retirement costs without sacrificing your quality of life? Spending does generally decline in retirement. The real challenge for many retirees is how to cut retirement costs — and by enough to keep spending below income — without resorting to radical, depressing solutions like eating bologna sandwiches five days a week.You work too hard building a retirement nest egg to waste any of the income it provides. So here are experts' tips for cutting retirement costs, often by a lot, in four key areas:How can you put a dent into such a staggering demand on your retirement finances? Exercise and education can make a big difference.Corporate wellness programs are proliferating. Companies offer workers more and more incentives to exercise and change habits having to do with eating, sleeping, smoking and so on. Corporations are not pushing their wellness programs out of altruism. They see financial paybacks in the programs. It stands to reason that you can reap similar dividends by participating in what is in effect your own personal wellness program.Here are the numbers: 57% of workers who were at high risk of cardiac problems because they had such red flags as too much body fat and high blood pressure had switched to low-risk status after six months in a wellness program, according to a 2010 Harvard Business Review study.Those workers' medical claim costs fell by $1,421 on average compared to the previous year. For every $1 their employer had invested in the wellness program, it yielded $6 in health care savings.In a separate, more recent study reported by the Society for Human Resource Management, an employer got a return on investment of $3.80 for the disease management part of its wellness program and an ROI of 50 cents for the long-term lifestyle improvement part.The lesson: at the very least, exercise. If you can, join a wellness program that includes exercise at some place like a local health club or your condo's activities center. The participation cost is likely to more than pay for itself in lower medical costs. ""Retire as healthy as you can,"" said Rich Ramassini, a senior vice president for strategy and sales performance at PNC Investments. ""Then take steps to stay healthy and active. It pays off.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut what about when one of you does need a lift somewhere, while your spouse already has taken the car, perhaps to play tennis with her friends? It cost $6,354 to own and operate a small sedan for the year 2017, according to AAA, the motorist advocacy group. Ramassini says that use of riding-sharing services like Lyft and Uber tends to cost just a fraction of that.Once you do retire, you should have more time to perform maintenance and repair on your own. Stuart Ritter, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, said, ""Maybe you hired other people to do things like care for your lawn and stain your deck. Now you can do it yourself at lower cost because you have more time and flexibility in your schedule.""Are your handyman skills in some areas rusty? You can brush up at many hardware stores, especially big-box retailers that conduct instructional sessions, Ritter says.In addition, retirement gives people the flexibility to book things like flights and cruises at the last minute. ""If you don't mind the uncertainty, that's another good way to save a lot of money,"" he said.Heather Lord, a senior vice president of strategy and innovation at American Funds parent company Capital Group, added, ""As a retiree, you have more time to enjoy free entertainment such as art in the park and free local concerts in parks and libraries and schools."" Those can add up to big savings, avoiding regular full-price admission fees like $25, $50 or $100 or more per person, per event, Lord adds.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHow To Apply For Social Security Benefits: What You Need To Know

In such a pattern, the stock has already broken out but then posts three quick corrections of around 10% to 20% over a nine- to 16-week period.

Analysts see Q2 earnings rising 23% to 87 cents a share.On Jan. 2, Autohome had initially cleared a 17-week base that shows elements of a double bottom. This base gave a 67.79 standard buy point.A narrow five-day handle formed on the tail end of the base. That provided a slightly lower buy point of 65.67, a dime above the handle's high. That handle began forming on Dec. 22 last year and the resulting lower entry is very close to the 66.55 ""alternative entry point"" created by the middle interim peak wedged in between the two sell-offs within the base.Check out this recent Investor's Corner column on how a chart pattern can lead to more than one correct interpretation of the stock's current balance of supply (AKA sellers) vs. demand (buyers) and the proper time to buy.On the Leaderboard daily and weekly charts, users can see chart annotations placed in real time on specific buy points, including bases and follow-on entry points.Elsewhere, software sector leader Salesforce.com (CRM) rallied as much as 4.4% and struck a new high of 132.55 before pulling back and giving up nearly half of that impressive gain.

That would mark the fourth quarter in a row of low double-digit top-line gains. Sales jumped 5%, 7%, 12%, 13% and 16% in the prior five quarters.Apple has climbed 61% since it initially broke out of a first stage base on Jan. 6, 2017. The move past a 118.12 buy point in a cup with handle marked an emerging change in the stock's character.In other financial markets, the U.S. Treasury bonds saw a rebound in yields as investors sold. Reuters reported that two key political parties in Italy will work on forming a new government and avoid a new national election.Stocks across the world sold off on concerns that a major change in political leadership in the No. 3 eurozone economy could put Europe's main single currency system at risk.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.85% after swooning to as low as 2.75% on Tuesday.According to the CME Group, fed funds futures now see only a 25% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise the short-term cost of money four times this year. In March, the U.S. central bank hiked the Fed funds rate by a quarter point to a range of 1.5%-1.75%.Bond traders expect the Fed to bump the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points again in June and in September.

Small caps continued to lead, with the S&P 600 rising for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Baidu says that COO Lu Qi will leave the role and no longer oversee the search engine giant's artificial intelligence efforts. Qi had joined the company in late 2016 to head up AI efforts. Baidu has made huge spending bets on AI to drive future growth.The stock fell 6.2% to 262.50 in premarket trading. That would push Baidu back below a conventional entry of 275.07 from a long consolidation.Applied Materials earnings rose 54% to $1.22 a share in its fiscal Q2, with revenue rising 29% to $4.57 billion. Both comfortably beat analyst views. But the chip-equipment maker sees Q3 revenue of $4.43 billion. That's roughly in line with the Zacks estimate of $4.45 billion, but clearly below other consensus targets for $4.53 billion.Applied Materials fell 5.1% in the premarket, suggesting a move below its 200-day moving average at Friday's open. On Thursday, the stock fell 2.2% to 53.96, once again hitting resistance at its 50-day moving average.The Applied Materials stock chart, which previously had been forming a double-bottom base, is starting to look like a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern.Meanwhile, Lam Research lost about 1.5% early Friday. KLA-Tencor was not yet active Friday but had fallen late Thursday by about 1.5%. Lam has been fighting to hold above its 50-day, while KLA-Tencor is just above that level.Applied Materials is heavily exposed to the memory market, with over half its sales going to the DRAM and flash markets. Memory giant Micron Technology lost 0.6% early Friday. Micron fell 3.2% to 54.70 on Thursday. The IBD 50 chip stock has been building the right side of a consolidation, retaking its 50-day line on Monday.The broader chip sector has been so-so in recent months. Chipmakers and fabless chipmakers have done reasonably well, helped by Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) moving into buy range. A few others are consolidating in decent form, but breakouts are scarce. But chip-equipment makers have struggled in recent months, with the Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment group falling to 133 out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD. The group's relative strength line has been lagging for nearly six months, reflecting its underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.Typically, the broader stock market struggles to rally without chips. The major averages have largely done so in recent weeks in part due to the surge in oil stocks. But it's also due to Apple (AAPL), which is a huge buyer of chips. But Apple's big recent breakout reflects optimism about a $100 billion buyback, strong growth in services and Warren Buffett buying more shares. None of that benefits chipmakers. Indeed, iPhone shipments were slightly below estimates in the latest quarter.But with Apple now pausing after its 17% surge over nine sessions, watch to see if the relationship between chips and the broader market reasserts itself.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Small Caps Sail As Rest Of Market HesitatesBest Oil Stocks: Callon Petroleum Grows Like Gangbusters In Permian BasinThe Stock Market Myth That Too Many BelieveTop IPO Stock Triggers Sell Signal, But Rebounds; Is It Safe To Buy?Deere Reports, These 2 IBD 50 Stocks Form Bases: Investing Action Plan

""As battery capacity increases, the vehicles become more appealing, which will all combine to improve demand and profitability.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe rush to roll out electric cars may seem curious, given lagging demand and margins for traditional passenger cars in North America. Ford plans to abandon passenger cars here for the most part and instead focus on high-margin trucks and SUVs. Meanwhile, GM and Tesla are estimated to be losing thousands of dollars per unit on their electric cars. And Tesla Model 3 production is struggling to ramp up to targets.But automotive industry forecasts point to electric vehicles taking a 40%-50% share of the global auto market by 2040, up from around 3% today. GM plans to sell 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026, including electric trucks and SUVs. Tesla aims to build 1 million cars in 2020 (though its targets are notoriously optimistic). Volkswagen sees up to 3 million a year by 2025. Toyota eyes electric vehicles and hybrid sales of 5.5 million by 2030. Even truck king Ford (F) is investing $11 billion in electrification, with Chairman Bill Ford saying ""We're all in now.""But the auto industry still has work to do to turn a profit from their electric cars.Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland told IBD it's ""very, very difficult to make a profit, but not impossible."" She says Toyota reportedly needed more than 10 years to turn a profit on the hybrid Prius. GM will take at least that long for the plug-in hybrid Volt. She estimates the Bolt EV could turn profitable quicker because it borrowed technology and lessons from the Volt.UBS analysts performed one of the most comprehensive EV cost examinations ever last year with a Chevrolet Bolt teardown.UBS estimated that GM was losing $7,400 on every Bolt EV based on its $37,000 price tag before government incentives. (Those incentives will be phased out as manufacturers start to reach their cumulative sales volume caps.)By an easier measure, Tesla's higher-end Model S reportedly carries a marginal cost of $30,000 excluding the company's fixed, up-front costs, implying a hefty marginal profit vs. its $70,000 sticker price.But UBS estimates Tesla loses thousands of dollars on the Model 3, which is priced at $35,000 before incentives. A customer would have to buy $6,000 in additional options for Tesla to break even on each sale after all expenses. Meanwhile, Tesla as a company loses money overall.And if Tesla hopes to reach CEO Elon Musk's goal of generating 25% gross margins on the Model 3 by the end of this year, a customer would have to cough up $16,250 on extras for a total of $51,250, UBS said. On Saturday, Musk announced a high-performance version of the Model 3 that would be priced around $78,000.For its part, GM should have by 2028 a margin of 5% on earnings before interest and taxes for the Bolt, UBS predicted.""The cost of making batteries is going to dictate whether you make a profit or not,"" Lindland said.The Bolt's battery pack, which includes cells, assembly modules, control and cooling systems, costs $12,300. By 2025, UBS sees that dropping 37% to $7,800. Savings should come from cell chemistry, higher energy density and lower assembly costs.GM has revealed little about how its next-generation batteries will drive down costs, apart from increasing energy density.Higher density means a battery offers more energy generation, faster recharging and a longer useful life, while also reducing material and assembly costs.Solid-state batteries promise to more than double the energy density of current lithium-ion technology. EV maker Fisker, Toyota, LG Chem, appliance maker Dyson and several Chinese companies are working on the technology.Meanwhile, Munro & Associates, which partnered with UBS on the Bolt teardown, also tore down the Tesla Model 3 recently. The benchmarking firm lauded Tesla's battery, rating it higher than batteries from Samsung SDI (a BMW i3 electric car supplier) and LG Chem (a Bolt supplier).But the costs of metals used in batteries could be an obstacle, with cobalt supplies tight and dependent on risky African trade. Lithium is abundant, but mining projects take time to develop. China's dominance of rare earths also looms over the auto industry.While the battery represents the biggest source of savings for electric cars, other powertrain modules offer potential too.The electrical drive, including the e-motor, transmission and motor housing, costs about $1,200. UBS sees that falling 10% by 2025. New e-motors with fewer moving parts should cut machining and labor costs. They also could reduce or even eliminate the use of costly rare earths. Toyota recently developed a new magnet for electric motors that halves the amount of neodymium required.Power electronics, including the e-motor controller, converter and power distribution unit, make up another $1,200 in costs. Here, UBS foresees savings of 25% by 2025, driven by innovations in semiconductors. Chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM) replaced standard silicon with silicon carbide in its inverters and onboard chargers to make EV electronics more efficient.Other miscellaneous components, for thermal management, charging and cabling, add more than $1,500 to costs. Potential to reduce costs is sizable in some cases and limited in others, UBS estimates.The auto industry is also looking afresh at the entire design and production process.Redesigning vehicle architecture allows companies to imagine mechanically simpler, more efficient electric cars, RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a May 11 note.Ford, for example, expects its next EV lineup to slash footprint in the final assembly area in half. That should produce a 50% cut in capital costs and a 30% improvement in labor hours per unit.GM will use its new EV platform across cars, crossovers, SUVs and self-driving vehicles, streamlining production costs.A highly optimized EV platform also could eliminate unnecessary elements that carried over from traditional cars, Navigant's Abuelsamid said.UBS estimates the Bolt's price tag could be $13,200 lower by 2025, with economies of scale a key driver of the reduction.Scaling up will be pivotal to cutting battery costs, which is why Tesla is building its ""gigafactory"" to mass produce them.RBC's Spak says global EV battery production capacity will surge to 346 gigawatt hours in 2025 from 143 GWh last year. Such growth will produce economies of scale that should allow manufacturers ""to gain fixed-cost leverage and lower costs.""A major catalyst for mass production is coming from the global momentum against auto emissions. China, India, Norway, Britain and France plan to slowly phase out gas and diesel vehicles. (Sales of electric vehicles in China, the world's biggest auto market, are already on pace to hit 1 million this year.) California lawmakers have toyed with a similar mandate.""Automakers are forced to reach to develop and offer EVs that are really expensive to make and that people don't really want to buy,"" said KBB's Lindland. ""That's why we continue to see incentives on these.""A concurrent trend is improving the business case for electric cars: autonomous taxi service. GM calls robotaxis a multitrillion dollar market. Morgan Stanley sizes the personal transport market at $10 trillion, far bigger than the car market.Electric vehicles are envisioned for these future fleets of shared autonomous cars as they would be easier and cheaper to maintain.Waymo, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL), plans to launch a driverless taxi service in Arizona this year. It has tested in Texas, California, Michigan, Arizona, Washington and Georgia. GM plans a similar service next year, and tests in California and Michigan with plans for Manhattan next year.GM's service may be why it has a bullish 2021 timeline of achieving EV profitability.""As a pure consumer retail play, profitability is a stretch in that time frame, especially since they are on target to use up all federal tax credits by early 2019,"" Navigant's Abuelsamid said. ""As a service play I think they can get more volume and revenue.""He added that several of GM's 20 forthcoming electric cars ""will probably be focused on autonomous mobility applications where the potential for recurring revenue changes the business model and the way you calculate profitability.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How Google Can Race Ahead Of The Pack In Self-Driving CarsFord Is Lagging In This $1 Trillion-Plus Opportunity: AnalystAI, Global Stocks Drive Growth In Electric Cars, Autonomous VehiclesAutomotive Industry News

1007,KEY,"The Russell 2000 showed on Thursday that stocks today remain in a confirmed uptrend, at one point rising more than 0.6%. But the general market stumbled lower in afternoon trading on news reports that President Trump expressed doubt that the U.S. will make concrete progress in ongoing trade talks with China.Even as the major indexes deflated, market breadth remained positive. On the Nasdaq, winners beat losers by a 4-3 margin. On the NYSE, winners led by roughly 100 issues. And, at the Russell 2000's session high of 1627, the popular gauge of small-cap stocks is up almost 6% through nearly five months of trading in 2018.China's Baozun (BZUN), a small-cap e-commerce expert, cleared a 52.43 buy point in a new base. Shares reached as high as 53.90, up 19.5%, before pulling back some.Baozun has already seen 11 million shares exchange hands, more than double its float of 19 million. The stock trades on average 2.6 million shares a day.Baozun ranks No. 8 in IBD's current Global Leaders Stock List.At 2:30 p.m., the Russell 2000 advanced 0.4%. The Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average slumped around 0.3%. The S&P 500 edged down 0.2%. (For more updates on stocks today, please check IBD's Stock Market Today section, found beneath ""Market Trend"" on the homepage of Investors.com.)Volume is mixed, running lower vs. the same time Wednesday on the Nasdaq but higher on the NYSE.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, shows that the FAANG stocks shouldn't be ignored either.The iPhone, iPad and digital services titan is not participating in the market's upside, but the nearly 0.6% decline in superdull volume (apologies for the stock-market-style oxymoron) is actually a good thing for Apple investors. Why? The stock is making a quiet pullback after thrusting nicely past a new buy point: 179.04, 10 cents above the 178.94 middle peak within a double-bottom base.The double bottom is one of seven critical chart patterns that every savvy growth stock investor can use to build positions at the precise moment that a true market leader breaks past historical price-resistance levels and ramps to a series of new highs.On Jan. 6, 2017, Apple initially broke out of a first-stage cup with handle that furnished a 118.12 correct buy point. IBD's Stock Market Today feature covered that breakout in real time as well as the setup of that key juncture in the stock's current turnaround story.Baozun, featured frequently in Investors.com and IBD Weekly over the past few years, helps multinational companies gain inroads into the Chinese consumer market. You can read more about what Baozun does in a June New America article.The stock has 19 million shares in the float and 55 million shares outstanding. The market value is just under $3 billion. Early on Thursday, Baozun posted a 29% increase in earnings to 9 cents a share. The first quarter appears to be one of Baozun's seasonally slowest periods. But that 29% EPS gain also comes on top of a 75% jump to 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.First-quarter revenue rose 25% to $146.4 million, the highest for any first quarter in the company's history. That result is almost the same as Baozun's full-year revenue in 2012.Keep in mind that the stock swings much more wildly than any S&P 500 firm. Thursday's breakout past a 52.43 buy point is from a late-stage pattern. This does not mean the breakout won't work. But the risk of a negative reversal and a breakout failure is higher.Baozun initially broke out of a long, deep, first-stage cup base near 10 in late August of 2016.Elsewhere in stocks today, Cisco Systems (CSCO) gapped down at the open and slid more than 3% to 43.56. The Nasdaq tech giant undercut its 50-day moving average and is now nearly 6% below a 46.26 buy point in a cup without handle.That decline is not enough to execute the golden rule of investing.Watch to see if the data networking pioneer can hold up close to and eventually retake the 50-day line. As reported by IBD earlier today, Cisco has announced a huge new stock-buyback plan.For those who bought at the 46.26 entry, investors would have to cut losses at 8%, or when Cisco hits 42.56.Lithium miner Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) dropped more than 4% to 55.24 in volume running nearly triple normal levels. Yet the sell-off does not wreck the current work on a new base being formed by the Chilean company.On April 5, Sociedad Quimica gapped up bullishly in price, leading to an eventual retaking of the 50-day moving average. That's a good sign. It means institutional investors are getting greedy again, showing renewed demand for shares.The Street sees SQM's earnings rising 10% to $1.80 a share this year and 17% in 2019. Over the past six quarters, earnings have lifted 320%, 82%, 77%, 19%, 105% and 35% vs. year-ago levels.That impressive record meets the C factor in CAN SLIM, IBD's seven-point paradigm for growth investing.

1011,KEY,"A NASA safety group said Thursday that SpaceX's controversial plan to fuel its ""space taxi"" rockets while astronauts are on board is a ""viable option.""XSome NASA officials had flagged the ""load and go"" issue, among others, as a concern leading up to test flights of SpaceX's so-called space taxi later this year. But the space agency's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel offered a vote of confidence for the company founded by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk.""My sense is that, assuming there are adequate, verifiable controls identified and implemented for the credible hazard causes, and those which could potentially result in an emergency situation … it appears load-and-go is a viable option for the program to consider,"" said retired Capt. Brent Jett Jr., a panel member, according to the Los Angeles Times.SpaceX's ""load and go"" procedure involves loading super-chilled fuel just 30 minutes before launch because loading it earlier raises the risk it will heat up.The super-chilled fuel is a critical part of SpaceX's cost-saving strategy of reusing rockets. Because it is more dense than the traditional mix of liquid oxygen and fuel, more can be fit into the boosters. The extra propellant leaves the boosters enough fuel after launch to land back on earth.But astronauts and ground crew members have never been near a rocket during fueling. And fueling rockets with astronauts on board goes against NASA's practice during the space shuttle program of fueling before they enter the spacecraft.The issue came up during a meeting of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology in January, after an explosion during fueling in September destroyed a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.SpaceX is confident that its fueling procedure is safer than traditional practices, because loading the super-chilled propellant is faster and lowers the exposure time for any problems to arise.Musk also has said an abort system in SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which would house astronauts atop the Falcon 9 rocket, can save astronauts in the event of a fueling problem.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Musk now expects an uncrewed mission to happen in August instead of April, with a crewed mission set for December instead of August.Boeing's unmanned test of its Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner capsule is due in August, and its crewed test is scheduled for November, but the company has reportedly warned that the crewed test could be pushed back to 2019.Boeing shares closed up 2.1% at 351.23 on the stock market today, clearing a 348.67 entry in low volumw.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Space Industry News And Top Aerospace Stocks5 Insane SpaceX Predictions CEO Elon Musk Made Ahead Of Falcon 9 Launch

1012,KEY,"Oil & gas groups have risen to hold the largest share, four slots among the top 20 groups out of the industries tracked by IBD. Next in line are medical sector industries. Hospitals, medical products and outpatient care all hold top 20 positions.Any even faster-rising group — medical software — has gained 9% over the past four weeks. That lifted it into a No. 36 ranking on Friday, up from No. 120 six weeks ago.A surprising number of advancing stocks, namely Veeva Systems (VEEV), Medidata Solutions (MDSO), Teladoc (TDOC), Tabula Rasa (TRHC) and Evolent Health (EVH), are driving the advance.The group garnered added attention Friday, when Cerner (CERN) announced it had finally landed a deal to provide digital records-keeping tools to the U.S. Veterans Affairs Department. The $10 billion, 10-year contract had been left hanging by a thread after Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin was fired in March.But Cerner's profits are wobbly and its shares, consolidating since January, are far from the top seed in the group.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The stock is up 81% year to date, despite a failed breakout attempt in February and March.It holds a weak 35 EPS rating from IBD. But consensus views project a 167% earnings gain in Q1, and a 152% advance for the year.Another plus: Tabula's relative strength line has been slicing cleanly to new highs all year, a sign of comparative strength.Also worth keeping an eye on is Evolent Health. Its stock is staging an aggressive recovery, with a 59% gain since December 29. The company turned profitable in the first quarter, and now has five quarters of earnings acceleration under its belt.For the year, consensus views still project an 8 cent per share loss.

That is, if you're looking to make a quick trade based on sports betting — if analysts are to be believed.""We think the time to play the impact of sports betting in the U.S. is sooner (rather) than later, as we believe the 10,000-foot view of what the opportunity could mean, is likely to be better than the reality of what it ultimately does mean,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli said in a note to clients.Santarelli cited the case of online gaming legalization in New Jersey in 2013. That's where estimates of market size far outpaced the ultimate reality of the market. Then-Gov. Chris Christie claimed the market could be worth $1.2 billion, but first-year revenue in 2014 ended up coming in at $123 million.The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act Of 1992 had effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide. That excluded sports lotteries conducted in Oregon, Delaware and Montana, as well as the licensed sports pools in Nevada.

However analysts believe there may be less gold at the end of the rainbow than some think.Meanwhile Penn recently got an upgrade to buy from hold by SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Analyst Patrick Scholes made the move after its first-quarter results turned around ""several months of underperformance.""A key to the stock's future performance however is management making synergy savings from its Pinnacle merger. It also hinges on meeting forecast margin improvements.The company has projected that it can achieve an adjusted margin using EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — of between 29% and 30% by 2020.""As (Penn) closes the (Pinnacle) deal (crystallizing financing) and executes against synergy targets, we believe the company can remove overhangs,"" Scholes said in his research note. ""Beyond proving out deal synergies, we believe (Penn) can also execute against longer term margin targets.""The recent performance of the stock has also impressed Santarelli. The analyst reiterated his buy rating following its most recent earnings report. He was impressed margins were up more than 100 basis points in each of the firm's operating segments. Cost reductions are also expected to continue in labor, marketing, and procurement.""We remain believers in the health of the regional gaming customer, (Penn's) margin improvement story, conservative (Pinnacle) synergies, and we believe this all comes at a compelling (double digit) pro forma (free cash flow) yield,"" Santarelli said in a note to clients.Analysts have renewed confidence in Penn since it upset the apple cart back in April by announcing that first-quarter earnings doubled to 48 cents per share, a result that trounced analyst estimates by 9 cents.""(Penn) started off (earnings) season for the regional gamers with a big surprise, as expectations of a miss and guide-down, ours included, turned into a beat and raise driven by March strength and strong margins,"" Santarelli said.Jefferies is also rating the stock as a buy, with analyst David Katz impressed that net revenues of $816.1 million exceeded his expected $803.4 million and Wall Street views for $807.5 million.""The quarter demonstrates the key positive aspects of regional gaming, which are modest growth in revenues and considerable margin growth opportunities,"" Katz said in a note. ""We expect the continued benefits of scale and technology to continue generating profit improvement through the forthcoming (Pinnacle) deal. The resulting cash flows are not reflected in the shares, in our view.""Meanwhile the business has impressed Telsey Advisory Group analyst Steven Wieczynski. He believes it offers superior shareholder returns over the next three to five years.""First and foremost, we sense the same-store business remains on incredibly firm footing, as the underlying regional revenue environment continues to look healthy,"" Wieczynski said in his note.He added: ""Furthermore, unrated play (not tracked by the casino for player comp rewards) remains on a positive trajectory at most properties, a trend we find extremely encouraging given unrated play is often a good barometer for the overall demand environment and the health of the consumer more broadly.""But there are warning signs for potential investors interested in Penn.The stock ranks a lowly ninth in the Leisure-Gaming/Equip industry group. The group itself is currently ranked 24 out of the 197 tracked, though it will surely get a tailwind from the recent sports betting ruling.In addition the stock has a few red flags, with its IBD Composite Rating of 77 a concern.

1025,KEY,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) surged to a four-month high Tuesday as an analyst acknowledged ""the turnaround,"" upgraded the stock and boosted her price target on the pharmaceutical company.On the stock market today, Valeant popped 3.6% to close at 21.56. Valeant stock is forming a cup with a buy point at 24.53. Broadly, shares of pharmaceutical companies rose 0.1%.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler upgraded Valeant to a buy rating from neutral and raised her price target to 27 from 15. She noted, ""we acknowledge the turnaround.""""After a drug-by-drug review, we conclude that Valeant is growing its key brands and has stabilized losses from older products,"" she said in a report to clients. ""There is even potential pipeline upside.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseToday, Valeant's profile looks more Mylan's (MYL), Koffler said. About 70% of its sales consist of stable products that are either consumer-focused or are older drugs that have already gone generic.Further, ""there is actual growth potential from its pipeline, which contains multiple catalysts in 2018-20,"" she said. ""For this stock to work in the next year, we think Valeant simply needs to execute on its quarters and push through new product launches.""So far that's happening. In the first-quarter, Valeant stock jumped after the pharmaceutical company topped sales views and raised 2018 guidance. The firm will soon change its name to Bausch Health Companies, after its Bausch and Lomb segment.Valeant pledged to double its dermatology revenue over the next five years. Koffler doubts that promise will come to fruition. But she does see $1 billion in sales from Valeant's ""significant seven"" drugs as possible.Among the ""significant seven,"" Valeant lists psoriasis treatments called Siliq, Jemdel and Duobrii. It also has treatments for glaucoma, eye redness and opioid-related constipation.The firm expects sales to grow at a 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate from 2018 to 2021, and for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to grow 5% to 8%. Koffler sees the guidance as challenging.But other pharmaceutical companies have set similarly high, ""seemingly unattainable,"" growth targets, she said. Plus, there's minimal clinical downside for Valeant as ""there are minimal pipeline expectations, so if anything works, it is upside to the stock.""Upcoming, the Food and Drug Administration will consider approvals of three drugs — two psoriasis treatments and a drug to treat acne. It's also possible Valeant could unveil data from studies of medicines to treat acne.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Always Cut Your Losses Short

1036,KEY,"Much of the conventional wisdom about what skills it takes to get to the top and succeed is wrong, according to new research.For example, only 7% of CEOs graduated from Ivy League colleges. Forty-five percent of CEO candidates had at least one major career setback, yet 78% percent of those still won the position.In a ""Moneyball""-style research study, author Elena Botelho analyzed the data tied to successful leaders, much like the baseball executive in the famous movie used statistical analysis to prove that the conventional wisdom of baseball's way to measure player productivity was wrong.""We spent a decade applying state-of the-art analytics to a database of over 2,600 leaders to uncover who gets to the top and what sets apart the best CEOs,"" said Botelho, co-author with Kim Powell of ""The CEO Next Door: The 4 Behaviors That Transform Ordinary People into World-Class Leaders."" Botelho is also a partner in leadership advisory firm ghSMART.Tips on sharpening the right career skills:Master something. The most effective CEOs are 10 times more likely to be skilled in one or more of the four key behaviors highlighted in ""The CEO Next Door"": decisiveness, relentless reliability, engaging people for impact, and adapting boldly.Hire a mentor. ""The fastest and most effective way to develop any skill is to seek the guidance of a coach,"" said Stacey Hanke, author of ""Influence Redefined: Be the Leader You Were Meant to Be, Monday to Monday.""Be decisive. Aim for speed over precision, Botelho says.Her research advises making fewer but faster decisions, rather than spending too much time deliberating over the perfect one.Decisive CEOs are 12 times more likely to be high performers, she says.Show relentless reliability. Deliver what you promise, on time, every time, Botelho says.This sounds simple, but it turns out to be ""the most powerful behavior,"" she emphasizes. ""CEOs who are known for being reliable are 15 times more likely to be high-performing, and their odds of getting hired are double that of everyone else.""Reliable leaders do seemingly little things like being on time for meetings, planes and phone calls, and they follow up on agreed-upon actions.Adapt boldly. This is not so much about having a perfect lens into the future as it is about embracing a willingness to let go of the past, Botelho says.Conduct annual spring cleanings, she writes. ""Ask yourself and your team what habits, practices and assumptions hold you back today,"" and let those go.Remember that Kodak, Blockbuster and Borders were once household names, but failed to adapt.Engage for impact. Maintaining deliberate routines and being steady keep CEOs close to the business and its people so they can communicate what is important, Botelho says.While ""wildly charismatic 'masters of the universe' may prowl unchallenged in the boardrooms shown in Hollywood films,"" she continued, ""in real boardrooms, results speak louder than charisma.""Seek accountability help. If you don't measure something, it doesn't get done, Hanke says. And expanding your influence alone is nearly impossible.Hanke advises identifying areas where you'd like constructive criticism and then asking individuals in your circle to hold you accountable daily or weekly.Develop consistency. It's the difference between a good communicator and one with true influence, Hanke says. Make sure your verbal and nonverbal communication is in alignment.""When your listener is not guessing who is going to show up every day for every conversation,"" she said, ""they begin to trust you, which encourages them to follow your lead.""If you speak publicly or to a group regularly, record video of yourself. Analyze it to improve your performance, Hanke says.Perfect abilities. ""Think like an athlete,"" Hanke said.

1038,KEY,"President Donald Trump's No. 1 rule for making deals is to always come to the table with leverage. But on Sunday, Trump tweeted that he would give up perhaps his biggest leverage in trade talks with China: sanctions on Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE that amounted to a death sentence.So what did Trump get in return for letting ZTE off the hook for violations that included defying a ban on sales to Iran and North Korea? Far from hacking $100 billion to $200 billion from the U.S. trade deficit with China, as Trump had demanded, the deal reported to be emerging would mostly restore the status quo before trade tensions erupted in March.Since then China has put the brakes on purchases of U.S. soybeans, even before it was set to impose 25% tariffs in retaliation for Trump's threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of mostly high-tech imports from China. Meanwhile goods from pork to Ford (F) cars have piled up at Chinese ports amid tighter inspections meant to punish U.S. producers.Beijing made a bet that the U.S. wouldn't be able to endure tariffs aimed at U.S. farmers, with an eye on punishing Republicans at the polls in November. It appears, at the moment, that Beijing's calculation was on the money. When China first detailed its plan to match Trump's tariffs blow for blow, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $100 billion worth of Chinese goods, but that now looks like mere bluster.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStock market investors viewed the trade developments as good news, diminishing economic risk. The S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite slashed moderate gains to close slightly higher on the stock market today, China wasn't to blame. Qualcomm (QCOM), a key beneficiary of Trump's latest deal making, held onto early gains, rising 2.7%.Beijing said it would restart its regulatory review Qualcomm's pending purchase of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) after earlier halting that process. That suspension followed Trump's move in March to block Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO) from buying Qualcomm. NXP rose 12% on Monday.Both China and the U.S. are focused on which country's tech firms will develop next-generation 5G wireless network systems. Collaboration increasingly seems to be off the table. The U.S. also is said to be investigating Chinese communications equipment giant Huawei for violating U.S. sanctions policy.Trump tweeted that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE ""a way to get back into business, fast,"" after the Chinese mobile-phone company halted operations due to U.S. sanctions that kept it from buying key components from U.S. suppliers.U.S. optical components makers that are big ZTE suppliers rallied Monday. Acacia Communications (ACIA), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Oclaro (OCLR), which had sold off April 16 on the ZTE ban, were winners Monday, but off session highs.One more possible explanation for Trump's dramatic ZTE reversal: He may be putting his North Korean diplomatic initiative ahead of trade goals and is working to shore up Beijing's support.Jefferies economist Ward McCarthy called the softening of the U.S. position on ZTE ""an encouraging development."" ""It suggests that the U.S. and China are both making progress on trade talks and trying to find ways for both sides to be able walk away from the table and claim that they won concessions, saving face in the process,"" he wrote.Yet Trump's comments about letting ZTE off the hook because ""too many jobs in China"" were at stake prompted something of a backlash. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., responded that the ""Problem with ZTE isn't jobs & trade, it's national security & espionage.""On Monday, Trump defended his ZTE reversal, noting the impact on U.S. companies and the ""larger trade deal"" being worked on with China.ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi.— Donald J.

Pure Storage qualifies as the No. 3 stock, according to IBD Stock Checkup, in the Computer-Data Storage industry group that's ranked No. 7 of 197 groups based on price performance and momentum. Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner said in a recent note to clients, initiating coverage on Pure Storage, that FlashBlade accounted for roughly $80 million, or 10%, of product sales in the past year.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski expects FlashBlade to emerge as Pure Storage's top revenue producer ""over the next 2-3 years, as more Big Data and Artificial Intelligence workloads are deployed.""In a recent note to clients, Nowinski said the unstructured data that dominates artificial intelligence historically is stored on disk-based, networked devices from the likes of NetApp (NTAP) and Dell Technologies (DVMT). He says they ""cannot meet the performance requirements of next-generation analytics.""Nowinski sees Pure Storage's system that relies on flash memory rather than spinning hard-disk drives, as ""uniquely positioned to capture market share in this segment.""FlashBlade's debut in the second half of 2016 opened a new market for Pure Storage. It also gave the company a full portfolio to serve the data-storage needs of enterprise customers.Supporting all of a customer's workloads has helped Pure Storage move upmarket. It sells to cloud-service providers and has gained more Fortune 500 customers looking to consolidate storage vendors used in their data centers, Nowinski says.About 50% of FlashBlade customers were already Pure Storage customers, he notes. The company said it signed up about 500 new customers in the latest quarter. That raised the total to more than 4,500 organizations.The company puts its total addressable market opportunity at $35 billion. Meanwhile, the market for external storage systems stands at $23 billion a year and dropped slightly in 2017, William Blair analyst Jason Ader said. He expects it to be flat over the next several years. Yet the areas that Pure Storage plays in grew 35% last year, he says.Tech research firm IDC expects all-flash arrays to comprise 44% of external storage sales by 2021. That's up from the current figure of 28%. Scribner thinks that projection could prove conservative.""Current infrastructures are based on old, slow, scale-out architectures which demand many data copies and silos, fragmenting the potential of data and increasing its cost and complexity,"" Pure Storage Chief Executive Charles Giancarlo said on a recent earnings call.Giancarlo came aboard as CEO last August, having previously served as chief technology officer at Cisco Systems (CSCO). Cisco is a key partner for Pure Storage and seen as a potential acquirer. Pure Storage markets its FlashArray and FlashBlade storage system with Cisco networking gear in an optimized package called FlashStack.Ader adds that roughly 30% of Pure's revenue in the latest quarter came from public cloud customers, such as software-as-a-service providers Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW).""Management has noted that this vertical has been growing faster than the overall business and that it now has over 500 cloud customers to date,"" he wrote.But getting business from the big public cloud providers such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is considered out of reach.Still, Pure Storage said last August that FlashStack was seeing triple-digit growth. It reported thousands of deployments in more than 30 countries.The company is widely credited as being the technology leader in its field. Industry research firm Gartner placed Pure Storage as being furthest along on its ""completeness of vision"" axis for solid state arrays.Ader says Pure Storage designed its software and systems architecture from the ground up to take advantage of flash media. In contrast, rivals for the most part designed their products for hard disk ""and only later retrofitted for flash.""The market appears to be recognizing that leadership as evidenced in customer win rates. Those are ""ticking up quarter-by-quarter,"" Giancarlo says. Further, Ader notes, Pure Storage was able to carve out 66.4% product gross margins in calendar 2017 vs. 50.2% for NetApp.With so much going for it, what could slow Pure Storage's momentum?""The biggest risk is the competition,"" Ader told Investor's Business Daily.Dell EMC has acknowledged its market-share struggles in storage and pledged to spend $2 billion to turn it around. Dell last week unveiled new storage products aimed at negating Pure Storage's technology lead.But Piper Jaffray's Nowinski wasn't impressed. He compared Dell's updated product line with that of what he considers the more up-to-date Pure Storage.His assessment: It ""did very little to narrow the gap.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Pure Storage, 58.com Are Breakouts; These 3 Top Stocks Are In Same Bullish PatternCloud Software Stock Splunk Breaks Out Of Base Ahead Of Quarterly ResultsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1041,KEY,"Software has been the sector to be in this year, making iShares North American Tech-Software (IGV) a winning choice for ETF investors.IBD's software sector is No. 1 out of 33 sectors, up an unmatched 19% since Jan. 1. It's not only the best sector performance but also well above the next best sectors: Medical and Consumer are up about 11% each.IShares North American Tech-Software has advanced about 17% for 2018. With $1.7 billion in assets, it owns nearly 60 of the largest software companies in the U.S. and Canada, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).Those three companies plus Salesforce.com (CRM) are the largest components of the fund, each with 7.6% to 9.3% of the portfolio.

The data analysis software company is near a 112.76 buy point and has risen nearly 40% from a breakout past 84.98 at the start of the year.More than half the fund is invested in what it calls application software and one-third in system software. The rest is home entertainment software.Twenty-one of the holdings are in IBD's enterprise software and specialty enterprise software industry groups. Those two are up 25% and 21%, respectively, this year.

Many analysts remain bullish on technology stocks in general, and in particular the large caps.""At the start of the year, the bear case was higher (interest) rates. That hasn't hurt the group,"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of market analysis firm DataTrek Research, said in a note Wednesday. ""Then it was fear of regulation. And the sector still worked. There's a reason for that Teflon coating: The fundamentals of large cap Tech are head and shoulders above anything else.""The ETF cleared the 179.35 buy point of a cup-with-handle base on May 7. Shares rose modestly and pulled back to the entry this week. They've held at that level and are in buy range.

1042,KEY,"Celgene (CELG) toppled to a four-year low Thursday after it appeared on a list from the Food and Drug Administration that tried to ""shame"" drugmakers working to block generic competition.Some pharmaceutical and biotech companies are ""gaming"" the system by limiting access to their drugs for generic rivals needing to do equivalence studies, the FDA said. Analysts, though, expect the so-called ""shame list"" to have little more than a headline impact on these companies.In total, Celgene received 31 inquiries for samples of drugs Revlimid, Pomalyst and Thalomid. All three have Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, programs to ensure the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks. These drugs have certain distribution requirements.Celgene reportedly said any biotech companies wanting to access these drugs would need to follow specific rules. The biotech said it already has provided samples to companies that fulfilled these requirements, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""As such, while Celgene might be putting up an understandably high barrier, we believe generic companies willing to put in the appropriate safeguards have already been able to obtain Revlimid to conduct bioequivalence studies,"" he said in a note to clients.The inclusion of Celgene on the list is unlikely to speed along generic competition for Revlimid, Williams said. As of now, the drug is ""gated more by (intellectual property) than regulatory questions,"" he said.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed agreed. Celgene is already working through generic litigation regarding Revlimid. Analysts expect copycat drugs in 2022.""We believe this is more modest headline risk than actual business risk,"" he said in his report.On the stock market today, Celgene shares dipped 1.7%, to close at 79.98. They earlier slipped to a low last seen in June 2014. Meanwhile, collective shares of biotech and pharmaceutical companies each lifted a fraction.Other key drugs listed include Biogen's (BIIB) multiple sclerosis medicine Tecfidera, as well as Gilead Sciences' Letairis and Truvada. Letairis treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and Truvada treats HIV.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay notes the FDA also included BioMarin Pharmaceutical's (BMRN) Kuvan. Kuvan treats a condition associated with an elevated amino acid. BioMarin shares dipped 1.4%, near 88.30.Still, BioMarin has already settled with several general pharmaceutical companies for generic entry after the patent expires in 2020.""Further, while the FDA's (list) publicizes efforts to prevent generic entry, no actual policy has been put in place to deter or diminish the strategies branded manufacturers employ to limit access to branded drugs,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

1048,KEY,"Cloud computing firms are driving large investments in artificial intelligence and major chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA) are competing to provide the tech backbone for AI services, a Wall Street research firm said Monday.Nvidia has been an early winner in the field, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino says. But don't count out other chipmakers, he adds.""While we see different technologies succeeding in an AI world, graphic processors appear to clearly have the most staying power given early success,"" Zino said in a note to clients. ""We also view fears of cloud providers designing their own processors for AI as overblown.""Graphics chip maker Nvidia has captured much of the attention in the artificial intelligence space. It offers an end-to-end computing platform using graphics processing units (GPUs). Plus, its systems are used for deep learning, addressing both training and inferencing, Zino said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We continue to see Nvidia's Volta architecture in a dominant position for most training applications in the cloud over the next couple of years,"" he said. ""Since the start of 2017, GPUs have sped up training of deep neural networks by as much as 12x.""Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is Nvidia's top rival in graphics processing units. AMD has the ability to sell both GPUs and central processing units (CPUs) to data-center customers. That could give it a ""competitive advantage long-term,"" Zino said.Intel (INTC) leads in the business of providing CPUs for servers in data centers. It's now developing complementary technologies using memory and programmable chips, he said.Xilinx (XLNX), a maker of field-programmable gate arrays, could grow to be a significant player in chips for artificial intelligence, Zino said.""While revenue related to AI remains negligible for the company, we believe Xilinx's programmable chips will see increased opportunities related to machine learning/real-time deep learning in the data center,"" Zino said.He noted that key data-center customers, such as Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and China's Baidu (BIDU), could be looking to broaden their use of Xilinx's FPGAs.Other leading cloud service providers pursuing artificial intelligence include Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Facebook (FB), Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY).""We believe that the major public cloud providers will look to outduel each other by offering more extensive AI-powered services,"" Zino said. ""These cloud providers are investing heavily to create an infrastructure that is allowing organizations to use the public cloud for AI as an inexpensive way to test different applications using their data.""Some internet cloud firms are developing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for artificial intelligence. But those efforts are not likely to threaten the major AI chipmakers, Zino said.""Fears about cloud providers designing their own processors for AI are overblown,"" he said. ""Cloud providers like Alphabet, Alibaba and most recently, Facebook, are all exploring chip development to produce internal chips that can help their AI applications run better while lowering costs.""Those firms are working on ASICs, which are customized to perform a narrow-focus job extremely fast, he said.

President Trump's tweet eases fears of a U.S.-China trade war, though that those concerns have cooled in recent weeks.China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries.

Acacia Communications fell 36%, Oclaro 15%, Lumentum 9% and Finisar more than 4% that day.Some of these optical stocks have recovered somewhat: Lumentum has rallied on its own earnings and those of key customer Apple. But they are generally below their pre-ZTE ban levels.As for ZTE, the Chinese firm has essentially halted operations. The U.S. government, or at least President Trump, may not have realized the impact the ZTE ban would have. Trump tweeted Sunday that he's ordered the Commerce Department to find a way to help ZTE.President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 13, 2018Lumentum and Finisar rallied about 4.5% in the premarket.

1053,KEY,"A classic IBD sell signal is the long-overdue sharp break and significant close below the 10-week line in heavy volume. It can indicate an impending change in trend. But what exactly do we mean by ""heavy"" volume?Look for at least a 40% increase in turnover compared to the 10-week average to indicate that institutions may be shifting their mindset toward the stock.Every IBD weekly chart on Investors.com shows the 10-week moving average as a line draped across the weekly volume bars. Click on any volume bar to see the actual volume and the percentage change.That break — combined with other sell signals — can be a great time to lock in solid gains. However, it's never a certainty that the stock will continue to fall; many leading growth stocks will simply form a base and offer a new buy point. So keep track of that stock. Be prepared to buy that stock back if it breaks out again.It's also impossible to know how long or far the stock can fall before rebounding. Factors include the strength of a company's fundamentals and the probability that either the company's growth or the greater economy will stall.Back in 2016, Amazon.com (AMZN) slashed through its 10-week line in the week ended Jan. 8, as volume increased 57% above average (1).The stock's significant close below the 10-week line was its first time since an April 20, 2015, breakout above a 389.47 buy point.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

On April 29, the stock broke out past that level (2) on strong results.Facebook (FB) triggered that sell signal in the week ended Feb. 9 this year amid the market's sudden drop. That week, the stock declined 7.5% on a 68% surge in volume. Over the next five weeks, the social media giant rallied in low volume, showing that institutions weren't very excited to purchase additional shares. This past week, the stock has dropped more than 10% and took out its 40-week line on a deluge of negative news.Facebook had not made sufficient efforts to protect user data in regards to Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm.

Last month the company said it had bought the personal finance app Clarity Money, which will strengthen its Marcus online lending service. Management is also looking into adding credit cards and wealth-management tools.""This move clearly shows that Goldman Sachs sees big opportunity in credit cards,"" said Matt Schulz, CreditCards.com's senior industry analyst. ""Despite worries in the industry about the rising cost of rewards and the uptick in delinquencies, banks still make a ton of profit off of credit cards and Goldman Sachs wants to get its share.""Schulz added: ""This isn't just about short-term profits for Goldman Sachs. It's also about branding. It's about tying their brand with Apple's hugely powerful brand and potentially establishing long-term relationships with Apple's highly desirable customer base, who tend to be younger than your typical Goldman client, more affluent than the average American and famously loyal to Apple.""Amazon (AMZN) reportedly has talked with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Capital One Financial (COF) to create a checking-account-like product intended to attract teenagers that don't have credit or debit cards.Amazon's business-lending service also has reportedly partnered with Bank of America (BAC) to offer small-business loans.An account for cardless teenagers would allow Amazon to draw in that population early.

Or is the stock selling off so badly that a full exit is the right move?Is there another place to get even more detailed commentary and insight on what the top leaders are doing right now? Yes. Leaderboard, which launched a brand-new interface and new features on Thursday, can help.IBD's market writers create annotations on daily and weekly charts of the top 10 stocks ranked within the IBD 50. When one of these stocks hits an ideal time to buy, a blue annotation gets added. For sell signals, watch for annotations in red.These features arm both the beginning investor and the seasoned veteran with even more expertise on market timing. These annotations are placed in real time and are based on the rules IBD has developed through decades of research on what actually works in the stock market.Leaderboard users see regular updates on current action and a ""Leaderboard analysis"" for these top 10 stocks. The analysis also helps optimize the management of stock positions to reduce risk when the rally becomes long in the tooth. When market choppiness and corrections intensify, a user will get suggestions on when to cut the position by half. When the market uptrend resumes in bullish fashion or if the stock improves, the analyses note the precise moment in which to turn a half-size position back into a full one.Netflix (NFLX) ranked No. 10 within the IBD 50 at Thursday's close. The online video streaming giant joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard on Dec. 6, 2016, just as it rushed past an early entry point at 120. By February, the stock rose to 145. Leaderboard put a red annotation on the weekly chart, suggesting to take profits as the breakout gain hit the 20% threshold.Those with tons of conviction could, of course, decide to hold longer. Netflix has formed numerous bases since then, but the uptrend has stayed intact. More recently, on April 5, Netflix re-entered the Leaderboard as a half-size position. This made sense, given that market swings have been much more intense vs. 2017. On April 17, Netflix's Leaderboard chart showed a switch to full position following strong Q1 results. But the stock got cut back to half position just five trading sessions later as the stock began to gyrate.The most recent annotation to return to a full position? On April 26, as Netflix held firmly above the 50-day moving average. Institutions were shoring up the stock.Abiomed (ABMD) ranked No. 2 on Thursday. The Leaderboard analysis pointed out that buying back shares at 304.38 was justified, even though the stock had just flipped beneath that proper buy point. Abiomed triggered the golden rule of investing (cut your losses short). Yet it sometimes pays to buy back a good stock a second or third time. You need courage. But if the fundamentals are superior, and the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, you don't want to miss the potential big move.The chart noted how Abiomed has been showing nice buying support near the 10-week moving average. That's a hallmark of great stocks as they make their big price runs.E-Trade Financial (ETFC), also in the top 10, shows a third-stage base count on the annotations in its weekly chart. The higher the base count, the more risk that a breakout will fail. But the online broker continues to show positive action in the RS line and its tendency to hug its 10-week line.Trade the IBD 50 in one click with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital.

1067,KEY,"Why are handles an important part of two key chart patterns, the cup with handle and the double bottom?In a nutshell, these visual patterns represent a final significant decline in a stock, setting the stage for a possible surge to new highs.This final shakeout of weak shareholders acts as a verification that selling is done and the stock is ready to advance.The breakout comes when institutional investors start buying like there is no tomorrow. That surge of volume powers the stock to its breakout and larger gains.Here are some basic characteristics of the handle-related chart action to help you know if they're proper or not.First, a handle is a moderate decline lasting at least five days. Most handles require at least a couple of weeks to form. The handle length is generally proportionate to the base. That means the longer the cup, the longer you can expect the handle to be.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEffective handles drift downward in price in declining trade. The light volume in the handle shows that the final shakeout of weak shareholders is different from intense institutional selling.The handle's decline must be contained. During normal market conditions, handle areas should drop no more than about 8% to 12%.A midpoint of a handle should also form above the midpoint of the highest and lowest prices of the preceding base. To figure the midpoint, add the high and low points for the entire base, then divide by 2. Perform the same calculation for the handle.If the result for the handle's midpoint falls below that of the base, the handle is too low. Maybe that's not a deal killer, but it adds risk.A handle should also form above the stock's 10-week moving average. Research shows that — like handles that form below the base's midpoint — breakouts from handles formed below the 10-week line are failure-prone.The lows in the handle should not drift upward. Such action is called wedging, and it usually leads to failed breakouts.XTO Energy, now owned by Exxon Mobil (XOM), built a complex handle at the end of September 2002.At the time, the Houston-based energy producer was in transition. It had been shifting its focus from oil to natural gas over the past several years. It had just changed its name from Cross-Timbers Oil a year earlier.Shares corrected 28% in a 14-week, double-bottom pattern begun in May 2002 (1).Shares pressed briefly above the buy point on Aug. 19 but reversed to end lower. That was Day No. 1 of what would become a six-week handle (2).Shares drifted lower over the next three weeks — not quite the settled action you'd like to see.On Sept. 10, they pressed to just below the 21.05 buy point in strong trade. This was the break point. The handle settled into picture-perfect action, edging lower in soft volume for the next two weeks (3).Volume soared Sept. 30, followed by the breakout in twice average volume on Oct. 2 (4).Patient investors who bought at that buy point and held on through February 2006 could have made a 128% gain. If they stayed put through June 2008, the gain would have been 250%.(Editor's Note: A version of this column was originally published in the July 8, 2010, edition of IBD.)RELATED:How Can I Determine The Market's Primary Direction: Read This Column FirstThe Basics Of Smart, Profitable Investing: All About The Cup-With-Handle PatternHow To Invest: Why Paycom Software Built A Flawed Cup With Handle PatternHow To Invest: How To Find Advanced Buy PointsStocks Near A Buy Zone

1068,KEY,"Specialty retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has been quietly undergoing a change.Two statistics describe the change: At the end of fiscal 2014, online sales accounted for about 4% of Ulta's total sales. As of the recent conference call in March, the percentage grew to 12.8%.The tripling is impressive when the investor considers this came while Ulta's overall sales were showing no slowdown from their historically fast pace. Revenue grew 20% to 25% in each of the past seven years.Also, Ulta Beauty continues to add to its physical-store count.At the conference call in March, CEO Mary Dillon noted that Ulta Beauty opened 16 new stores in Q4 and plans to open 100 in 2018. The company has 1,074 stores.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""One area of focus will be our store experience,"" Dillon said.She explained, ""We continue to evolve our store format to respond to guests' rising expectations for an experiential environment.""The experiential environment is a key ingredient for many successful retailers. Such stores create an ambience. For retailers such as Sephora, the Apple Store, Whole Foods Market and Pinkberry, the appeal is substance and style.Meanwhile, e-commerce has received a load of attention, even if the industrywide statistics draw a smaller picture than news coverage would suggest.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales in Q4 accounted for 9.1% of total sales industrywide.In that respect, Ulta's 12.8% weighting in e-commerce sales is bigger than the market's weighting.One area where Ulta Beauty is strong is pretax profit margins. In fiscal 2018, pretax margin was 13.7%, the highest in at least nine years. Pretax margin hit double-digit percentages in 2012 and has stayed in double digits since.Amazon.com (AMZN) is the king of online retail, but the retailer now has a bigger physical-stores footprint than not too long ago.In Q1 2018, Amazon's physical store footprint was about 8.4% of net sales. In the full year 2017, the physical footprint was about 3.3%.Amazon completed the acquisition of Whole Food Markets in August, which boosted Amazon's physical-store sales.Ulta Beauty's stock rose about 33% from October to January. This served as the 30% prior uptrend for Ulta's most recent base. The base is 23% deep and part of a much larger consolidation.The stock has been trying to close above a 249.40 buy point in recent sessions.Amazon's chart is a late-stage story, which carries more risk of failure than an early stage breakout. The stock shaped a short, cup-with-handle base. Although a handle sketched a high at 1568.62, the pattern was too short to be valid.RELATED:Taser's Parent Company Soars7 Ways To Profit From The Trump BumpCan A Great Stock Lead After A Late-Stage Base?

1069,KEY,"Stocks got off to a mixed start Friday, as the Dow industrials struggled to stretch its rally to an eighth day, but earnings-driven declines by Nvidia (NVDA), Symantec (SYMC) and others dragged on early trade.The Dow Jones industrial average clung to a fractional gain in opening trade. Verizon (VZ) was an early strong suit among blue chips, up 1.9% after an upgrade from JPMorgan.The S&P 500 also defended a narrow gain, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped into tight early losses. Security software developer Symantec fell hard, to the bottom of both indexes.Earnings news provided a hub for early action, with Nvidia, Trade Desk (TTD), Yelp (YELP) and Symantec all posting significant moves.On the Dow index, Verizon swung to an early lead, after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to overweight, from neutral. Verizon shares spiked, then sold off hard at the end of April, on news of a $26 billion merger between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS). Shares ended Thursday 13% below their April high.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNvidia was a key a name to watch Friday, opening almost 2% lower after its late-Thursday earnings report.  The graphics chip pioneer crushed fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, and gave second-quarter revenue guidance above consensus views. The company offered no earnings guidance for the second quarter. Still, the industry leader's slip threatened the week's strong performance among chipmakers.Friday's early loss dragged the stock back below a flat-base buy point at 254.60. The chart also can be interpreted as a double-bottom base. By that view, shares remained extended 5% above the 239.35 entry.Nearly all of the chip stocks listed on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index moved lower in early trade.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell alongside Nvidia, down 2% in early action. The Philly Chip Index gained 4.9% for the week through Thursday, and was leaning toward its first two-week advance since March.Symantec collapsed 35% as analysts downgraded the stock following its fiscal fourth-quarter report late Thursday. Weak guidance damaged an otherwise stronger-than-expected quarterly performance. Symantec shares had climbed 17% in a seven-week advance since March, attempting to build the right side of a seven-month consolidation.Trade Desk spiked 33% in opening trade. The online advertising services platform reported late Thursday its first-quarter earnings growth accelerated to 89%. Growth in revenue also accelerated for a 61% increase. Both numbers easily topped analyst targets. Management's raised second-quarter and full-year revenue and earnings guidance were well above consensus hurdles.The IPO's opening action marked a breakaway gap, that lifted sharesw well beyond buy range past a 61.03 buy point in a gnarled-looking cup base. This remains a buy opportunity, but it's best to read up on buying breakaway gaps before trying to jump in.Another IPO, Dropbox (DBX), fared less well. The stock stumbled 2.1% lower after reporting better-than-forecast first quarter earnings, revenue and user growth late Thursday. It was the company's first report since going public in March. Shares remained 50% above their IPO price.Business review site Yelp spilled nearly 9% lower, despite reporting a narrower loss and better revenue growth than expected in its first quarter. The loss ended a six-weekj advance, sending the stock below its 10-week moving average in heavy trade.Energy stocks were largely quiet as crude oil prices traded narrowly lower early Friday. U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate was down 0.3%, holding well above $71 per barrel. Crude gained 0.3% Thursday, with WTI settling at $71.36 a barrel, up 2.4% so far for the week.

That left the benchmark with a 4% gain for the week, its best since mid-February, as it attempts to climb up from a three-month consolidation. China's Shanghai Composite slipped 0.4% Friday, ending the week with a 2.3% gain. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo capped the week with a 1.2% rally Friday, advancing 1.3% for  its seventh straight weekly gain.Europe's market improved to mixed trade Friday, with Frankfurt's DAX and the CAC-40 in Paris each down more than 0.3% in afternoon trade. London's FTSE 100 fought to hold a fractional gain. For the week, the FTSE 100 is up 1.7%, the DAX ahead 1.2% and the CAC-40 holds a fractional gain.

1070,KEY,"Stocks in the REIT Leaders screen rarely make major moves, unless something happens that rocks the industry. That's exactly why Gramercy Property Trust (GPT), a key player in the warehouse REIT field, showed unusual action as it soared 15% Monday.The real estate investment trust agreed to a buyout offer from Blackstone Group (BX) that's valued at $7.6 billion. Affiliates of Blackstone offered $27.50 per share for Gramercy, which owns warehouses in the U.S. and Europe that it leases to companies.Gramercy has been increasing its industrial assets, which are now about 80% of the company's portfolio. The rest covers office space and specialty retail. In 2015, less than half of the properties were industrial. Buildings are in major metropolitan areas such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Dallas.The growth of online commerce has expanded the need for warehousing and logistics. Last year, Gramercy announced a joint venture to acquire and manage distribution centers specifically for online retailing, where demand for warehouse space is strong.In a presentation last month, Gramercy said some of its largest tenants are FedEx (FDX), gym operator Life Time Fitness, Bank of America (BAC) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Last month, logistics company Prologis (PLD) agreed to acquire logistics real estate company DCT Industrial Trust for $8.4 billion, including debt. DCT owns 71 million square feet of space.The deal underscores demand for warehousing space, and suggests other deals may be coming.Blackstone and Gramercy have both been in IBD's Dividend Leaders and REIT Leaders screens thanks to solid dividend yields and dividend growth rates.Blackstone has an annualized dividend yield of nearly 7%.

1071,KEY,"A longtime Wall Street analyst who has watched his bull case for General Electric (GE) unravel fessed up to being wrong on GE stock in a note to clients Monday.""The bears won. The game is over,"" wrote Melius Research's Scott Davis, who has researched industrial equities for 25 years, including prior stints at Barclays and Morgan Stanley.Davis expressed embarrassment at ""being associated as a bull in the worst-performing stock of the year.""Nonetheless, he reaffirmed a buy rating on GE stock and a price target of 27, arguing that a breakup of the iconic company would boost valuations.Shares rose 1.4% to 14.27 on the stock market today, They have been straddling the 50-day moving average since the industrial giant's earnings and revenue beat in April. Among GE's Dow Jones peers, United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM), advanced 0.7%.. Honeywell (HON) rose 7 cents to 144.23. Siemens (SIEGY) climbed 0.4%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHere are the lessons Davis learned from the mistake that he now owns up to:While GE management ""explained away"" degrading contract terms with customers, cash flow was a red flag, Davis said. Margins on industrial free cash flow went from 7.1% in 2015 to 4.8% in 2017.""When down payments decrease, final payments don't match up with product delivery, and receivables grow faster than revenue, there is usually a problem,"" Davis added.Although he sees early signs of improvement in GE's cash flows, a fix for the ""deep"" hole the industrial giant is in will take time.Warning signals included a disproportionate rise in risk tolerance and M&A deals outside GE's historical scope to questionable compensation packages and a dismissive attitude toward those who questioned the company, Davis said.He believes the creation at GE of ""smaller, more focused entities that can build their own cultures"" may repair the problem.The conglomerate's 18-member board under former CEO Jeff Immelt lacked experience in many of the areas where the conglomerate was making a big push — such as software and emerging markets, Davis said. Many also lacked expertise in core GE segments such as power generation, aviation and health care, he added.Now Davis is of the view that ""an unusually large number of board members"" is among the key signs of weak governance, along with lack of diversity and lack of talent in technology, especially software.The $143 million in fees for auditor KPMG can lead to potential conflict of interest and bad behavior, Davis said. It's now clear to him that ""the audit cost alone indicates a company that is way too complex"" — and the company's recent, delayed financial restatement has not allayed that fear. The late filing is another sign of complexity, he added.Davis had a turnaround thesis on GE last year, but later concluded that new CEO John Flannery had ""failed to see the depths of the company's problems and he had too much to fix for any one person to handle.""Davis noted that Flannery has been in charge almost a year now and ""we haven't seen much."" But he also noted that turnarounds that initially looked like they would take two years ended up taking three to five years at other companies.Davis admits his earnings model badly missed the ""the fast degradation in power markets and lack of recovery in oil/gas.""And he had recommended the stock ""while not fully understanding the risk in the insurance business"" and underestimating its complexity.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:GE Dividend Looks Safer On This Good News; Stock Tops Key LevelIf General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?From Boeing To GE, Companies Eye Trump's Decision On Iran Nuclear Deal

1078,KEY,"Recent volatility on Wall Street may have spooked some investors, but money manager Rob Lutts is looking ahead to further upside.He says he is ""pretty bullish"" on all equity markets, though he favors foreign and emerging markets due to their much lower valuations. And on the domestic front, he believes the S&P 500 will rise to 3000 by the end of this year.""We think many are underestimating the positive impact of eight years of extreme monetary stimulus,"" Lutts, founder, president and chief investment officer of Cabot Wealth Management, told IBD. ""We love that many professionals are now calling for a 5%-10% correction. I believe we completed the corrective phase a few weeks ago ... a nice summer rally will pave the way for higher returns.""Salem, Mass.-based Cabot, with more than $600 million in assets, uses exchange traded funds to help build client portfolios. Here, in his own words, are Lutts' three best ETF picks for the months ahead:KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A (KBA)We believe the China growth story is misunderstood. Many investors know Alibaba (BABA), Ctrip.com (CTRP), Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (TCEHY) and how these have been great growth companies in China. The valuations of these growth darlings are now a bit elevated and thus have less immediate upside.So what is the best way to invest in China today? We believe the A share market is much more attractive from a valuation perspective and has exposure to many lesser known growth companies. KraneShares put this fund together to track the companies that will be included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index starting June 1, 2018. China A shares will be a small position initially on June 1, 2018 — it will comprise a little less than 1% of the MSCI EEM Index. Over time it will increase — some estimate that if the China A market had 100% inclusion into the MSCI EEM market, it would be 13% of the Index. Today, the KBA fund has an attractive P/E of only 14 times 12-month trailing earnings and a dividend yield approaching 2% annually.The Chinese economy continues to drive global growth and investors should not ignore this part of the world. China's growth will continue due to continued urbanization, transportation improvements and higher internet penetration, manufacturing growth and expansion of the financial sector. The China growth story is still very much alive. KBA is a fine way to get exposure to the world's fastest-growing large economy.Guggenheim Solar Index (TAN)The time for solar energy is now. Why? The economics of solar are quickly becoming a lower-cost choice than coal and oil and natural gas power plants. The key difference is that a solar system has one upfront cost and then no fuel costs, and your costs are fixed for the coming 25 to 30 years. Your fuel cost (the sun) of course, is free and your cost will never increase. Maintenance is very modest and the cost of manufacturing and installing solar continues to decline rapidly.We were told recently by a representative of First Solar (FSLR), which is 8% of the TAN ETF, that First Solar's large-scale utility systems can now produce (all-in cost) power for 4-6 cents per kilowatt hour. This is of course very competitive when compared to coal and even natural gas, which can be as high as 7-10 cents per kWh. We believe in many markets solar is now the lowest-cost choice for power generation.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhy this ETF? The top five positions are all the leading providers of solar power globally. We have seen projections by the International Energy Association (IEA) in their 2017 Annual Report that they expect the total installed global cumulative installations to go from 425 gigawatts (GWs) to more than 1,000 GW over the next five years. They expect more than 575 GWs will be installed globally in the coming five years. We expect First Solar, Xinyi solar, Sunrun (RUN), Scatar Solar USA and SunPower (SPWR) will all grab a large piece of this new market. These are all in the top six holdings of the fund. The second-largest position in the fund is the leading energy converter — Solar Edge Technologies (SEDG). The time for solar is now — put some of this in your portfolio today.Global X MSCI Nigeria (NGE)Nigeria is an economy with huge potential, driven in large part by its young population. Forty-two percent of Nigeria's population is between 0-14 years of age. The median age of the population in Nigeria is 18. Why is this important? A young population is the engine of growth in an economy. Nigeria has many other problems that are well known (governance, corruption, and legal); thus, there are challenges to the thesis of investing in Nigeria.The current valuations of the fund are some of the cheapest in the world, with an average price-earnings ratio (P/E) of 8 and a dividend yield of 4.5%. These valuations, of course, have discounted a great deal of these challenges. We know of many banks that trade in Nigeria with a P/E multiple of 4-5 times earnings and carry dividend yields of 9%-10% (this valuation is about 25% of the average bank that trades in the United States).Nigeria now runs largely on the power of generators — there is a lack of power throughout the country — many businesses must generate their own power. It has been estimated that 45% of businesses run their own generators to operate their companies. One reason for the valuation discount is the lack of liquidity in Nigeria. The whole stock market of Nigeria trades a total of approximately $1 million-$1.5 million or so of volume per day. So establishing a position in Nigeria is difficult for an institution of any size. For this reason, we would recommend only smaller positions in Nigeria. The Global X ETF is a great way to invest in Nigeria.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Can The S&P 500 Shake Off Market Volatility And Go Past 3000?7 Ways To Profit From This Surging Sector's Trump BumpShould You Bank On Bank Stocks As The Fed Raises Rates?

1080,KEY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is trying to ""leapfrog"" Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) with its $1.6 billion acquisition of cancer immunotherapy biotech Armo Biosciences (ARMO), an industry observer said Thursday.Drugmaker Lilly is late to the game in cancer immunotherapy, Brad Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. Loncar runs several biotech stock indexes including the Cancer Immunotherapy Sector Index, which contains Armo. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy exchange-traded fund popped 3.6% Thursday.""The leaders are Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche (RHHBY),"" he said. ""If you're a company that has completely missed the boat and you want to play in this area, you have to do something to try to leapfrog the competition.""Early Thursday, Lilly made its first big move in the cancer immunotherapy space — an area of medicine in which drugs teach the immune system to fight cancer. Lilly said it would pay $50 per share of Armo in an all-cash deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArmo shares rocketed 67% to close at 49.80, as Lilly stock rose 2% to 80.86. Fellow drug stocks, like Merck and Bristol, both rose less than 1%. Roche, which had a failure early in the day in colon cancer, dipped 1.6% to 27.63.Lilly expects the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. Armo, a late-stage biotech, went public at 17 in January and quickly popped. It was a ""hot"" initial public offering, Loncar said, noting that its price early Thursday indicates investors may expect another bid on it.Leerink analyst Jonathan Chang noted that the acquisition price is a 68% premium over Armo's closing price Wednesday. He initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating and 50 price target earlier in the year. On Thursday, he downgraded Armo to market perform.""The deal confirms our investment thesis on Armo and, in our view, could read positively to other emerging immuno-oncology stocks,"" he said. ""It is unclear if other bidders will emerge, given (the) short closing date.""The acquisition makes sense as pharmaceutical stock Lilly tries to assert itself in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. Armo's lead drug, called pegilodecakin, is known as a cytokine. It boosts the strength of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors, like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo.Earlier this year, Bristol validated another cytokine drug called NKTR-214 by paying $1.85 billion upfront to partner with Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) on it. The deal hit a record for an upfront payment in biotech, Loncar said. Now, it's of little surprise that Armo is to be taken out.Loncar has consistently predicted that 2018 would be a big year for biotech deals, mergers and takeouts. The year kicked off with news of Celgene's (CELG) plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi's (SNY) bids on Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).But this deal for Armo is a little different, he said.""I think this one would have happened if we were in the middle of a terrible, bear market,"" he said. On the other hand, ""this is also a good example of large companies like Eli Lilly, many of them have not been at the forefront of innovation and they're having to buy into that.""Still, Lilly isn't alone in its trailing position in cancer immunotherapy. Roche, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) all have immuno-oncology drugs, but remain behind Merck and Bristol which are ""on a level of their own,"" he said.The cancer immunotherapy space desperately needed some good news, he said. Earlier this year, Incyte's (INCY) drug, known as an IDO inhibitor, failed in a late-stage combination with Merck's Keytruda in melanoma. Incyte's pain extended to other cancer immunotherapy stocks.Background volatility remains in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. The key, he said, is that these are all different pieces of technology. The Armo drug is different from the Incyte drug known as epacadostat.""Every news item sets people's moods,"" he said. ""Everybody is down on immunotherapy and thinks it's overrated. Then a deal like this happens and it causes the opposite reaction. Whenever you have an emerging technology like this it's going to be a roller coaster.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

1081,KEY,"Dow Jones futures rallied Wednesday morning along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, as crude oil prices rebounded solidly a day after President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal. Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield moved back above 3%.Despite concerns about the stock market and geopolitical impact, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed virtually unchanged Tuesday after Trump's Iran decision. Most top stocks in buy range continued to act well, with Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) nudging higher.Crude oil prices fell, but pared losses and held near multiyear highs Tuesday.Dow Jones futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value.

Meanwhile, the 2-year yield climbed to 2.52%, putting the spread at a still-narrow 48 basis points. That 3% yield, and the narrowing Treasury yield spread with the 2-year rate, pressured stock markets.Tuesday's stock market action held three key investing lessons. 1. Don't be swayed by outside noise and punditry; focus on the action of the major stock market averages and leading stocks. 2. The 50-day moving average looms large for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite. 3. Pay close attention to the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. The RS line is an easy way to separate true stock market winners from laggards.Investors should stay in tune with important business, political, economic and technology news and trends. That can inform your investing decisions. But your primary focus and investing guide should be the action of the major indexes — the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average — and the action of leading stocks.President Trump's decision on the Iran nuclear deal drew a lot of attention, and deservedly so. But ultimately, the collective wisdom of investors decided for now that Trump's decision to exit that accord was not a market-moving event. The Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite just inched higher in stock market trading Tuesday, while the S&P 500 index edged lower.Meanwhile, most recent breakouts fared well. Tech giants Apple and Nvidia rose fractionally, outperforming the broader market. Top oil stocks like Marathon Oil (MRO) acted bullishly, paring intraday losses or even gaining despite a modest loss for crude futures.The 50-day is often a key area of support for leading stocks as well as the major indexes. But it can also act as resistance. Since late January, the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have struggled to move above the 50-day line, with the few attempts short-lived. Both indexes are just below the 50-day currently, though futures Wednesday suggest they may make another run at that level.The Nasdaq composite reclaimed that level on Friday and is holding just above that line.Investors should always focus on the true stock market leaders. If you're going to take on stock-specific risk, you want to get outperformance. But in conditions like now, when the stock market uptrend is under pressure, besting the S&P 500 simply is a must.Apple, Nvidia, Mastercard and Visa all rose fractionally, moving higher but still within their 5% buy zones. While the price gains were modest, the RS lines all hit long-term or all-time highs. Marathon Oil fell intraday to 19.15 before roaring back for a 3.4% gain at 20.44, extended from an 18.76 buy point.

The stock found much-needed support at its 200-day line.In that quarter, adjusted earnings and sales growth came in at 40% and 26%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period. But that growth is a step down from the torrid levels of growth two quarters ago. Then, the company posted year-over-year profit and revenue growth of 64% and 48%, respectively.Analysts expect the firm's full-year earnings to grow 17% in 2018 and 11% in 2019.According to analysts at Bernstein, IPG is the dominant player among fiber lasers and its competitive edge is expanding. Lasers continue to replace conventional cutting tools. With lower costs, lasers have become more attractive for all manufacturers, not just the larger ones.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1120,KEY,"Former attorney general of the state of New York Eric Schneiderman allegedly had a pattern of slapping and choking women with whom he was intimate. He also spat at them, demanded threesomes, insulted them, threatened them and called one (who had dark skin) his ""brown slave,"" according to recent accusations.One woman claims that without warning he slammed her so hard that he broke her eardrum. Another woman says that his palm left a red welt on her face that remained visible the following day.These and other details about Eric Schneiderman were disclosed by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer in The New Yorker. Keep that in mind the next time someone suggests that the liberal media are untethered to reality and serve only partisan purposes. Schneiderman is not only a Democrat; he was a key Trump antagonist, and a champion of the #MeToo movement.This has left a number of feminists both furious and bewildered. It's disorienting to see people you admired and assumed to be moral betray everything they supposedly believed in — something conservative women (and men) have experienced, too.Samantha Bee, who had often lionized Schneiderman on her show, fumed, ""This is especially infuriating given his supposed woke bae-ness,"" she said. ""Schneiderman positioned himself as a feminist crusader. He championed the #MeToo Movement. ... He helped craft an anti-choking law, even though he's now accused of choking his girlfriends.""The Huffington Post consulted a psychologist to help explain how it was possible that ""male allies"" could become ""abusers.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseKatha Pollitt, who once flippantly warned, ""Never trust a male feminist,"" is almost to the point of condemning all men now. ""How simple life would be if only conservatives, or liberals ... were abusers,"" she wrote. ""In fact, though, the only thing one can say with assurance is that they're men. Yes, I know women can be abusers, and I know some men are great, but at the moment #NotAllMen is looking more like a wish than a declarative statement.""Samantha Bee's defiant conclusion is: ""You know who's a better advocate for women? Women. ... The future really is female, or at least it better be, because I am done with this."" Katha Pollitt's resolve is similar: ""I have no answers. But here's what I'm going to do: Vote for women. Support women. Protect women. Believe women.""In my forthcoming book (out June 26), ""Sex Matters: How Modern Feminism Lost Touch with Science, Love, and Common Sense,"" I push back against this feminist tendency to deride men as a class and to disparage masculinity itself as somehow pathological.In the 1970s, some second-wave feminists, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, were so possessed by hatred for men in general that they lost sight of basic morality. Atkinson urged NOW to take up the cause of Valerie Solanas, founder of SCUM (Society for Cutting Up Men). Solanas shot and attempted to kill Andy Warhol.The counterculture of the 1960s and '70s broke down social norms, and then regretted what was unleashed. Today, feminists are grappling with the long roster of supposedly ""enlightened,"" i.e., feminist, men who've turned out to be serial abusers or worse.Samantha Bee mentioned ""powerful weasels"" Harvey Weinstein, Garrison Keillor and Charlie Rose. The roster also includes Louis C.K., Al Franken, John Conyers, Matt Lauer, Mark Halperin, Leon Wieseltier, Bill Clinton and many more.Why are feminists more despairing about these revelations concerning liberal men than conservative women are about equally ugly stories concerning conservative men?The answer, I'd suggest, is that liberals tend to believe that one's politics and one's morality are the same thing. If you hold the correct views about abortion, the minimum wage, women's equality, gay marriage and guns, it means not just that you agree with me but that you are a good person. A man who champions the #MeToo movement would never hurt a woman, right?There is some mirror imaging on the right. Some conservative women are stunned to discover that men they thought were adherents of traditional morality turn out to be louts and even rapists.A key conservative insight is that character is a matter of behavior, not professed beliefs. Judge people by their conduct, not their branding. How do you mold decent conduct? Conscientious parents who teach right from wrong and a culture that reinforces those lessons.The feminists helped to weaken some of the mores and institutions that tended to control male lust and abuse. At the time, they thought they were fighting an unjust ""double standard,"" but the sexual revolution damaged all standards, and we continue to sift through the fallout.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1125,KEY,"Growth stocks have long been the focus of IBD screens. But what about exposure to broader asset classes? The IBD ETF Leaders Index helps with active asset allocation.Asset allocation relies on the fact that asset classes take turns in leading. Spread the exposure and you reduce your risk. Sadly, you also water down returns. Active asset allocation is a little different. Investors try to follow the movement among classes. Avoid declining asset classes and move that money to areas with more potential across asset classes, sectors, or geographies.That strategy is in line with the IBD focus of going where the strength is. The problem? Accessing foreign equity and bond markets can be difficult. Moving across asset classes can be expensive. Finally, high turnover can be time-consuming to track.The use of ETFs to implement active asset allocation helps. ETFs can package the foreign equities for you. Your transaction is in a domestic market in your currency. Many individual trades are combined for you into a single trade. That saves time and transaction costs. You also get a nice balance between diversification and concentration.With the IBD ETF Leaders Index, sometimes few ETFs will be selected. Still, the ETFs themselves don't have the risk of a single stock. However, the ability for concentration is still there. Multiple ETFs may enter from similar sectors. That allows overweighting where the strength is.In the latter part of 2017, IBD ETF Leaders concentrated in global stocks. The positions varied from broad emerging market funds like iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) to specific regions like iShares Latin America 40 (ILF). It could have country-specific ETFs like VanEck Vectors Vietnam (VNM) or more specific global sectors like the KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB). As the ETF space expands with new offerings, so does the opportunity for tactical allocations in the index.While that flexibility helps within an asset class, the active asset allocation also helps between asset classes. Relative strength is a key component of the screen. When bond ETFs are the leaders, that tells you something about the market's health. The last time bond ETFs appeared was amid a 15% correction in the S&P 500 in early 2016. A more dramatic example occurred in October 2008, when a high bond ETF concentration dominated until March 2009.Access to global and bond ETFs fills holes in a portfolio usually dominated by growth stocks. It might also grant exposure to cyclical industries or commodity oriented areas typically shunned by growth screens.The beginning of 2016 saw higher weights in utility related ETFs and then gold miners. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explorer & Production ETF (XOP) is a recent addition to the index. When growth is out of favor, the exposure can flow to other assets. That can balance a portfolio usually weighted toward growth and still achieve outperformance over the long term.Innovator Capital Management launched an ETF in December based on the IBD ETF Leaders index. The Innovator IBD ETF Leaders (LDRS) allows you to buy the components of the index in a single transaction.

1126,KEY,"The stock market faces several key tests in the coming week. Can the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq reclaim key support. Can Apple (AAPL) stock hold its 200-day? How will chip stocks respond? Will the 10-year Treasury yield top 3%? And is Twitter (TWTR) now a better stock than Facebook (FB) or Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL)?The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Friday. Apple stock, the top weighting in all three gauges, tumbled to just above its 200-day line. Several chip warnings set the stage for the stock market and Apple struggles; now Intel (INTC) leads several other big chip names with earnings this week. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield shot up to a four-year high of 2.96%, as inflation and Fed rate hike fears mount up.Those stock market tests are interrelated to a large extent. But there's also a big question. After struggling for years as a company and stock, Twitter has been roaring back over the past 12 months and in 2018 while FANG stocks Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet have lost momentum.The stock market is in a confirmed uptrend, and the major averages did close higher for the week. But the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite came under pressure just as stock breakouts were picking up steam. The 50-day line usually is an important level, but it's loomed especially large over the last several weeks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSince tumbling through its 50-day line on Feb. 5, the S&P 500 has only closed above that level 13 times. The Dow Jones has only been ended above the 50-day in nine sessions since Feb. 5. The Nasdaq was above its 50-day for the most part from mid-February to March 21, but since then it's had just 3 days over that line.The S&P 500 and other major averages rose slightly on the stock market today.After tumbling 2.8% on Thursday, the iPhone maker fell 4.1% on Friday, crashing through its 50-day moving average and closing just above its 200-day line. No question, Apple stock was a major reason for Friday's stock market sell-off.Apple did trade below its 200-day line for a few days in early February as the brief stock market correction bottomed. But aside from that unusual market environment, Apple stock has not traded below its 200-day line since July 2016.Technically, Apple is in a flat base. But its  relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at its lowest levels since mid-February. The RS line hasn't made headway in almost a year.Apple rose a fraction Monday morning.Chip stocks set the stage for Friday's sell-off in the major averages and Apple with gloomy outlooks from a trio of major semiconductor players: Chip-gear makers ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) and contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Taiwan Semi, which makes chips for Apple and many others, cited weak smartphone demand.The iShares Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) ETF dipped below its 50-day on Wednesday, then tumbled Thursday and Friday. The Philly Sox SOXX ETF rose slightly early Monday.While the stock market can rally without chips participating, it's not easy. Chips are a major part of the stock market. And chips are in so many products, from the Apple iPhone to the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3. So if semiconductors are struggling, that's a bad sign for several other big stock market sectors.Intel, Texas Instruments (TXN), MKS Instruments (MKSI) are among the key chip names on tap this week.The 10-year Treasury yield rose sharply last week, especially Wednesday-Friday, closing at a four-year high of 2.96% and contributing to Friday's stock market slide. With oil prices at their highest levels since late 2014 and wage pressures bubbling, inflation and Fed rate hike concerns are growing.On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2.99% and then pared gains to 2.97%.A year ago, this would have been a laughable question. At most, investors might debate whether Twitter or Snap was a better Facebook also-ran.Over the past 12 months, Snap has tumbled 28%. Facebook has climbed 16% and Google-parent Alphabet 25%. Twitter stock has more than doubled, surging 118%. In 2018, Twitter has rallied 33%, while Facebook is down 6% while Google and Snap are up 2% and 4%, respectively.Snap was massively overhyped for its March 2017 IPO. Facebook, struggling with user growth and time on site, is struggling with a data privacy scandal as well as Russian interference. Those Facebook woes have spilled over to Google, while both are facing growing headaches in Europe over competition and privacy concerns.Twitter has gained momentum. In the fourth quarter it crushed adjusted earnings views and reported its first-ever GAAP profit. Always popular with reporters, policy experts and newshounds, Twitter is building on its news niche with more video even as Facebook de-emphasizes news.Alphabet reports earnings late Monday, followed by Twitter early Wednesday and Facebook that evening.Twitter is consolidating just above its 50-day line, but does not yet have a proper base or buy point. Alphabet is working on a double-bottom base, just below its 50-day. Facebook has been moving higher, but is below its 50-day and 200-day lines.Alphabet and Facebook were just above break-even Monday morning, while Twitter rose a fraction.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Futures Signal More Losses; These Big Earnings Are On TapNot Just Apple: The Other Big Reason For Friday's Market Sell-OffThe Big Picture: Coming Week Could Turn Market AroundStocks To Watch: TD Ameritrade, Green Dot Among Stocks Added To IBD 50 ListFacebook, Amazon, Alphabet Lead Tech Earnings Bonanza: Investing Action Plan

1130,KEY,"Retirement sounded great to Jack Butorac, 69 — until he actually retired.Butorac, now CEO of Marco's Franchising, the nation's fastest-growing pizza chain, had retired at the age of 55 after a long career in the restaurant industry. He thought it'd be great. Finally, there'd be time to chase after what he thought was his dream — to be a pro golfer. Breakfast with his wife every day was a perk, too.It didn't take long, though, before he realized three things: He wasn't skilled enough to be a golf pro, golf isn't what really drove him, and his wife was tired of him being home.""I'd traveled for business all the time before and my wife had the house to herself,"" said Butorac, who has more than 30 years of experience in the food industry, including stops at Hormel, KFC, Fuddruckers and Chi-Chi's. ""She told me, 'You have to find something to do.' ""These realizations put Butorac on the path to a second act. Many people would be happy for their first. Butorac teamed with a group of private investors to buy franchise rights to the Toledo, Ohio-based Marco's Pizza chain in 2004 from its original owner, Pasquale ""Pat"" Giammarco. The goal? Turn Marco's, which had 123 stores at the time, into a national pizza chain.The results have been impressive. Marco's Pizza went from being the local pizza shop centered around Northeast Ohio to the fastest-growing U.S. pizza chain in 2017, says industry tracker Nation's Restaurant News. The company posted 17.1% sales growth last year, powered by 15.4% growth in units. Marco's reached 881 stores by the end of 2017. Sales reached $530.9 million last year, says Pizza Today. Meanwhile, Marco's is now opening a new store every three days on average and plans to have 1,500 locations open by 2020.That level of growth makes some other pizza chains look like they're standing still. Domino's Pizza (DPZ), the industry darling which has seen shares jump 1,600% in the past decade, posted U.S. sales growth last year of 11.1% and a 7.7% increase in total U.S. stores.""I'm a guy with goals. I like to build. What I've done my whole life is build,"" he says. ""I realized I'm not going be a great golfer, which I'm not, so I looked for the next challenge,"" Butorac said.Throughout his career, Butorac sought methods to help him be more successful, which he continues to use today. Those include:Jimmy Harmon, CEO of restaurant management firm Bennett Management Group, which counts Butorac as a board member, has been at the receiving end of the feedback. After a meeting, Harmon noted how Butorac verbally summarized three things: everything he asked other people to do, things he offered advice on and also new ideas. One of those items hinged on Butorac: He'd offered to help Harmon upgrade some equipment. Not long after the meeting ended, Harmon received an e-mail with a list of equipment vendors Butorac used in the past. ""Jack is always taking notes,"" Harmon says. ""He's great with follow-up.""Sometimes it takes just minutes to hear back from Butorac. Scott Shafer, a Marco's Pizza franchisee in Los Angeles, was having trouble with an equipment supplier when opening a new store in 2017. The supplier sent the wrong kind of oven. Knowing he'd get the runaround if he contacted the oven maker himself, Shafer texted Butorac, who was on vacation in Australia. Butorac called him back in five minutes. ""He had that fixed so fast it wasn't even funny,"" said Shafer, who grew up next to the original Marco's pizza location in Ohio and plans to open 10 to 20 more stores in California in the next six years.While researching which food business he'd buy coming out of retirement, Butorac and a business partner jumped into an SUV in their hometown of Louisville and drove to Toledo to meet with Marco's management. Along the way, they pulled over and stopped at five different locations and ordered the same food items. Butorac wanted to know if the food tasted good, but he was also looking for something more important: uniformity. At all five locations, Butorac saw the food looked the same, was packaged the same and tasted the same. That's exactly what Butorac was looking for. It told him the company had systems in place, albeit informal, to ensure uniform quality and service. This was a key factor convincing Butorac the basics were there to take the chain national.During a fishing outing with business partners at Hormel, several key executives talked about how the food company was able to accelerate business growth. They talked about how a book, ""The Oz Principle"" was a game changer, Butorac says. The book's key message is that establishing accountability is a key to successful management. Now, all managers adopt this principle at Marco's.Butorac is not looking for credit, but rather accountability. After buying franchise rights to Marco's, Butorac says the biggest challenge was standing out amid a crowded industry, with more than 70,000 pizza restaurants in the U.S., according to Statista. So he brought in people with skills he lacked and made them accountable. Syl Sosnowki, who had been at Papa John's, helped Marco's settle on what made it different: authenticity. Butorac learned from Sosnowki that the brand's differentiation is built on the fact that Marco's is the only top 10 pizza chain founded by an Italian American. That heritage actually improves its product. For instance, unlike many other pizza chains, Marco's never freezes its cheese or its dough, which is made by hand daily in the stores.Leaders must be willing to wait — months if necessary — to hire the right person for a role. Getting the right people in the right places is critical, he learned from what he considers one of his professional failures. He bought a Mexican food chain called Tumbleweed in 1995 with the goal to expand it. But some of the key members of the team ""had their own agenda"" and Butorac's business growth plan didn't pan out. ""That is where the bad hire issue surfaced. That was a mistake. A huge mistake,"" he said. The board decided to sell the company in 1999 instead of making growth the goal. ""That's when I decided to retire. I considered it a failure.""That's when the instructor realized the root of Butorac's stress and a way to help him. By his own admission, everything Butorac does is a competition. Golf. Tennis. Even reading is a race with him. Butorac has taken speed reading classes so he can get through 60 pages an hour. ""I like that feeling of competition,"" he said, but ""my body doesn't. I need to learn to manage it.""To help him, Butorac needed something to do when he was stressed. The instructor told him that when work became overwhelming, he needed to drive onto the freeway and get into the slow lane — and don't pass anyone for 10 miles. ""It worked,"" he said. Doing that enough times taught Butorac how to calm his mind, to the point he doesn't actually have to get into the car and do that anymore.Butorac is still intense. He's up every day between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. and checking e-mails. But now, rather than getting into the car, he makes time in the day to bike. ""I get exercise. It's not as stressful,"" he said.Above all, Butorac stresses that leaders know to focus on winning the big things and avoid sweating over trivial items. Keep your personal goal in front of you on your to-do list. ""Each of us has our own definition of success. Some are personal and some are financial,"" Butorac says. ""You just must have milestones you want to achieve. You're never done. You can always build.""Use your to-do list as your guide. Know what you have to get right every day.Overcame: Stress-related anxiety threatening his health and ability to have a long career.Lesson: Get out of the office. Don't rely on data and analytics for decisions. Go out and taste the pizza.

1132,KEY,"Walmart (WMT) struck a blow against rival Amazon (AMZN) by finally sealing a $16 billion deal for Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart.The retail giant is taking an initial stake of around 77% in Flipkart, which was founded by ex-Amazon employees. The deal, which is Walmart's largest-ever acquisition, requires regulatory approval in India.""India is one of the most attractive retail markets in the world, given its size and growth rate, and our investment is an opportunity to partner with the company that is leading transformation of e-commerce in the market,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a press release. ""As a company, we are transforming globally to meet and exceed the needs of customers and we look forward to working with Flipkart to grow in this critical market.""China internet and messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), hedge fund Tiger Global and Microsoft (MSFT) will be key strategic and technology partners in the deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDow Jones component Walmart fell 3.1% on the stock market today, hitting a seven-month low. Amazon was up 1%.In a research note, J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers said Walmart believed the deal offered a ""unique, moment-in-time opportunity"" to get in early in a potentially huge market. However he believes the capital may have been better allocated at home, especially as Uber will halt Walmart grocery deliveries next month.""With the Uber test reported to have ended, and AMZN in relentless pursuit, TGT already buying Shipt for $550MM in December, and COST and others partnering with Instacart, we'd prefer large capital deployments in fighting the last mile battle here,"" Horvers said.Baird Equity Research senior analyst lowered his price target on Walmart stock by $10 following the move.""Given pending EPS dilution, we are lowering our price target to $95 (from $105), or ~20x prospective FY19E EPS in the $4.60-$4.80 range,"" he said in a research note. ""That said, WMT's improving omni-channel relevance adds durability to the company's longer-term growth opportunity.""He also said the deal is CEO McMillon's ""boldest move yet as he continues to transform the company to compete/succeed in the future of retail.""Walmart and Flipkart will maintain distinct brands and operating structures. According to Euromonitor, online sales in the world's second most-populous nation are growing about 35% per year. Morgan Stanley sees India's e-commerce market growing to $200 billion in around a decade.Walmart's investment includes $2 billion of new equity funding. The aim is to aid Flipkart in accelerating future growth.Walmart expects a negative impact to fiscal 2019 EPS of around 25 to 30 cents, including an incremental interest expense related to the investment.For fiscal 2020 the company anticipates an EPS headwind in total of around 60 cents per share. This is comprised of an operating losses of approximately 40-45 cents per share. It also expects an interest expense of approximately 15 cents per share.The retail giant has not given a specific timetable on profitability.Walmart and Amazon had both reportedly bid for a controlling stake in India's leading e-commerce company, at a valuation of about $20 billion.Flipkart, founded in 2007, is India's most valuable startup. But it's not profitable. India is rapidly growing but it still has a relatively small middle class. Poor infrastructure complicates home delivery.Former Amazon employees founded Flipkart, and SoftBank reportedly had favored a sale to Amazon. But Flipkart's board reportedly believes Walmart could close a deal more quickly and smoothly. An Amazon-Flipkart pact would have faced regulatory hurdles, because Amazon is already India's No. 2 online retailer. Another point in discount giant Walmart's favor is its apparent willingness to let Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal continue to help lead the business.Amazon has committed $5.5 billion to India. Founder Jeff Bezos is keen to become the leader in the market of 1.3 billion people. The giant has already lost the Chinese market to Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD).Amazon and Walmart are in a knockdown, drag-out clash, trading punches in an escalating retail war with the lines blurring between online and offline.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Heading For The Checkout?

1141,KEY,"Few financial products divide investors more than exchange traded funds.While they're beloved by mom-and-pop buyers for their low cost and ease of use, some professional money managers have called ETFs ""weapons of mass destruction"" and complained that they're worse for society than Marxism.So it came as little surprise that the concerns of the active investing class — which is having a hard time keeping pace with index-based instruments like ETFs — bubbled to the surface at last week's gathering of the financial establishment at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills.This time around, the worries featured leveraged-loan ETFs, the impact of debt funds on the price of the underlying credit, and whether they drive volatility in bonds. Although ETFs own just 1% of the overall fixed-income market, as a BlackRock report showed last year, these fears are getting increasing attention as the funds grow and some analysts predict an end of the credit boom.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""What happens when we have a more meaningful correction this time around? Yes, they've handled the volatility so far, but it won't take a 2008 to crack them.""Debt ETFs have ballooned to more than $600 billion in the U.S., doubling their assets from just five years ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Loan ETFs pose a real problem because they promise investors immediate liquidity, which the underlying loans don't deliver, Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Partners, said at the Milken event. In addition, credit prices are often propped up by ETF buying, according to Michael Hintze, founder of the hedge fund CQS, while Ilfryn Carstairs of the investment manager Varde Partners said the funds could accelerate volatility — in either direction.The largest junk bond ETF — the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, which trades as HYG — has oscillated between large flows into and out of the fund this year, including four weeks when investors pulled out more than $500 million and three weeks when they added more than $500 million.However, that's not uncommon for HYG, which is often used as a hedge or short-term bet rather than a buy-and-hold investment. As such, its flows aren't necessarily indicative of sentiment in the high-yield market.

1143,KEY,"This year's top-performing U.S. diversified stock funds have regained or are very close to retaking their 50-day moving averages, thanks to Friday's market rebound.Though four small-cap exchange traded funds made the list of biggest year-to-date gainers through May 2, large caps still dominated. With the exception of one midcap ETF, First Trust Dorsey Wright Dynamic Focus 5 (FVC), the rest were big-cap names.PowerShares S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) topped the list with a 4.5% return, according to Morningstar Direct. The ETF tried to recaptured its 50-day line Friday as it works on a base with a potential 117.44 buy point.

1144,KEY,"Shares in Atlassian (TEAM) tried to claw back, after falling as much as 12% in Friday trades on a weak outlook, as bullish analysts cited record customer growth and product investments as key to its long-term strategy.Atlassian pared losses to 6.5%, and stood 58.21 on the stock market today. The enterprise software maker late Thursday reported fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue that topped views but its June quarter profit outlook proved disappointing.JMP Securities downgraded Atlassian to hold, but analysts at Oppenheimer and Canaccord Genuity raised their price targets.""Atlassian had its best-ever customer acquisition quarter, adding more than 6,000 net new customers, of which more than 80% chose at least one cloud product,"" Richard Davis, Canaccord Genuity analyst, said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDavis hiked his price target to 65 from 60. He noted that the software firm ended the March quarter with 119,158 customers, up 40% from a year earlier.Ittai Kidron, an Oppenheimer analyst, also was upbeat. He says Atlassian is focused on revenue growth.""June quarter EPS guidance was modestly lighter than expected, weighed down by near-term product investment and hiring aimed at capitalizing on new product and feature opportunities,"" Kidron said in his report. He raised his price target to 65 from 58.Atlassian sells project-management and collaborative software. Product engineering teams are big users of the software.Atlassian reported an adjusted fiscal second-quarter profit of 10 cents a share while revenue jumped 40% to $223.7 million, topping estimates. Analysts expected Atlassian to report adjusted profit of 8 cents a share, the same as a year earlier, with revenue rising nearly 37% to $218.4 million.For the current quarter, Atlassian expects an adjusted 12-cent profit vs. a 9-cent profit for the year-earlier period. Analysts had estimated earnings of 14 cents a share.""We believe the guidance implies elevated levels of research and development spending, which we view as a long-term positive for the company,"" said Bhavan Suri, a William Blair analyst, in a report.The company forecast revenue of $233 million, up 33% from the year-earlier period, in line with estimates.The company is ranked No. 15 in the IBD 50 roster of growth stocks.One negative for the third quarter was slowing billings growth. Atlassian recently announced price hikes. Some existing customers renewed contracts earlier than expected at current prices to avoid the increases, analysts said.Jefferies had downgraded Atlassian to hold, citing its valuation, on Wednesday before it reported earnings.Adam Holt, analyst at MofffetNathanson, expects a short-term pullback.""Atlassian has been an extremely strong performer — up 100% in the last year — and as a result, we are seeing nervous price action post-Q3 due to the premium valuation at over 10 times sales, smaller magnitude of beats, slowing billings growth, and limited margin upside in the guide,"" he said in his note to clients.Atlassian went public in December 2015 at 21 per share, raising $462 million. It acquired Trello and its project management app for $425 million in early 2017.Atlassian has been investing in new products. In the March quarter, it released a new communication tool, Stride, that competes with well-funded startup Slack.At Canaccord Genuity, Davis says Atlassian will face more competition.""We have known this management team too long to not conclude they are trying to anticipate the product roadmaps of Slack, Zoom, Dropbox (DBX), GitHub, Microsoft (MSFT) and a few others,"" Davis wrote.

1145,KEY,"If you want to make money in stocks this year, it's not too late to first take a few steps back before you go forward. Take some serious time out to review your past trades.You could dramatically improve the results of your portfolio performance going forward.It's always fun to see how your good investments worked out. But looking back also lets you see how and why the bad trades emerged. A sober analysis will give you a leg up for the rest of 2018. If you learn how you made your mistakes, you can write a rule about them and vow to always follow it. This disciplined approach will help you avoid making the mistakes again.First, print out charts of your disappointing trades. Mark the day or week when you bought shares and when you sold.Print a chart of the Nasdaq or the S&P 500, and study the market trend in which you made the trades. Did you tend to buy when the market was falling or flat-lining? Were breakouts from proper buy points fizzling fast? If yes, then write down this rule: I will deploy cash only when IBD's Market Pulse outlook states ""confirmed uptrend.""Your chances of catching a rising stock are now instantly greater.Note the price and volume of the stocks you buy. Do you home in on cheap shares priced in the single digits? If so, you might want to write a rule in which you focus only on those that trade for at least 15 a share. Also, focus on those with an average dollar volume of $25 million to $50 million or more. Institutions — the main drivers of big stock winners — tend to favor higher priced stocks with ample volume.Such a rule would likely have steered you toward big-cap winners such as PayPal (PYPL), which on April 21, 2017, cleared a 43.90 entry in a long cup with handle in active turnover, 45% above its 50-day average. At that time, the digital payments firm traded 5.52 million shares on average over the prior 50 sessions. So the average dollar volume was a hefty $240 million per day.When the market is in the late stages of a bull run, it's sensible to take gains quickly. Instead of waiting for each stock winner to rise 20% or 25% from the proper buy point, start taking gains at 10% to 15%.Avoid round-trips in good stocks. Don't let a gain of more than 10% gain evaporate to zero or become a loss. If you get shaken out of a stock, you can always buy it back when it presents a new buy point.Study the volatility of the stocks you traded. Do they swing, say, 10% or more from weekly low to high on a regular basis? Such stocks tend to chase people out after rushing to new highs.Are you trading too much? Take a break from all new buys if the number of losing trades begins to exceed your winning ones.Also, study your equity curve. Do it by plotting your monthly account balance on a graph. Over time, is your equity rising steadily and holding up well during long periods? That's ideal. But if the graph looks like a string of hairpin curves, you're more prone to taking too many trades that ultimately erase your hard-earned profits.One of the most important keys to achieving steady gains and staying in sync with the market is to watch the market every day.It takes only two minutes at most to check IBD's Market Pulse and scan the Big Picture column so that you know when to be in the market.If you don't make such a daily habit, your results will likely suffer.""Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to try to cram on a farm — to forget to plant in the spring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to bring in the harvest?"" Stephen R. Covey wrote in ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."" ""The farm is a natural system. The price must be paid and the process followed. You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut.""For serious IBD readers, post-trade analysis is part of the price that must be paid.(A version of this column was published in the Jan. 5, 2015, edition of IBD.

1146,KEY,"The stock market rose at the open, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones all solidly higher.

Starbucks (SBUX) rallied on a big Nestle (NSRGY) alliance. Top-rated chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) cleared a buy point at the open, while Alibaba (BABA) continued Friday's earnings rally. Nvidia customer Tesla (TSLA) said in an SEC filing that it ""may raise additional capital,"" but that didn't worry investors.The major market averages rebounded late last week, fueled by Apple's huge rally on earnings, a company share buyback and Warren Buffett's latest investment in the tech icon.The Dow Jones climbed 0.7%, with Apple and Exxon Mobil (XOM) among the Dow components tilting up in early stock market trading.

1148,KEY,"A key part of a swing trading strategy is how it minimizes losses in stock market corrections. But you also need nimbleness to get back in quickly when the market turns. Otherwise your performance can lag.This most recent correction in March started with little exposure in IBD's SwingTrader. Taking profits on the way up left us in cash at the Nasdaq composite's closing high on March 12 (1). We tried a trade in PayPal (PYPL) on March 14 (2) when the market was still close to its highs. We started scaling out the next day as the stock reversed.After a quick drop in the market, we put HubSpot (HUBS) on SwingTrader. It was only a half position. Though HubSpot was breaking out, the Nasdaq's rally attempt never cleared the high from two days earlier (3), which made us cautious. HubSpot exited the same day, ahead of its stop loss, because it reversed from its highs. It was a rare day-trading example for SwingTrader, but the negative action spurred us to protect capital.The Nasdaq composite had a more powerful rally attempt on March 26 (4). This time, the index was up over 3% and cleared the previous day's high. A spike in the Cboe Market Volatility Index, otherwise known as the VIX, also suggested a possible short-term bottoming signal. IBD's Psychological Market Indicators page shows this signal's history for the past year.We tried Netflix (NFLX) that day because of its relative strength at the time. Whereas the Nasdaq fell below its 50-day moving average, Netflix was well above its 50-day line. But this didn't pan out either. As the market and the stock reversed, we started scaling out of the Netflix position early in the day and removed the remaining shares at day's end.The Nasdaq had another rally attempt that failed quickly on March 29 (5). GoDaddy (GDDY) joined for only a day. We didn't wait for the stop loss and removed the stock as it and the market both showed bearish reversals. The early removal kept the loss small at just over 1%.IBD'S TAKE: SwingTrader is soundly beating the S&P 500 by going to cash before both 10% corrections in 2018. Take a free trial today.It was four losses in a row, but the damage was minimal. First, each purchase was one at a time and HubSpot was only a half position. Second, we cut losses quickly, averaging less than a 2% loss for each trade. That would keep the hit to your portfolio well under a half percent per trade. The Nasdaq by contrast fell 10.9% during that time.One of the psychological aspects of markets is a tendency to find success on the third try. It's a pattern that repeats itself. Often these waves down can last weeks or months. In the swing trading strategy, time is condensed and focused more on days.This latest third rally attempt began on April 3 (6) after another VIX spike suggested a short-term bottom. This time the Nasdaq had more substance to its pullback, with more than a 10% drop from its high. While the index gained 1% on this first day, it was an inside day. That's where both the high and low fall inside the trading range of the previous day. They tend to be questionable signs of direction changes.The following day, however, showed more power with a 1.5% jump on an outside day (7). Both the high and low fell outside the previous day's trading range. The Nasdaq closed near its peak, and it broke above the high from two days prior. We started adding stocks to SwingTrader the next day.The biggest headwinds have come from headlines, mostly on tariffs and fears of a trade war. Still, the Nasdaq staged a follow-through day (8), increasing the chances of the rally continuing, at least in the short term. The index poked its head above its 50-day line but closed the week back below it. Some retracement here wouldn't be unusual. The four names currently on SwingTrader held up through last week. Their performance this week will inform our market outlook and whether we'll need to go into defensive mode again.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Stay For The Stock Gains, Avoid Corrections With Swing Trading  Know The Three-Waves Rule In Bear Market DeclinesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

1151,KEY,"BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) and UniQure (QURE) are racing to be the first to market with a gene therapy that treats hemophilia — a prospect that could offer revenue north of $1.5 million per patient, an analyst said Monday.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz boosted his projections for hemophilia gene therapies to $1.5 million from earlier assumptions for $350,000-$500,000 per patient. Some treatments could go as high as $2 million per patient on a gross basis, he said.Schwartz's analysis is based on pricing for Luxturna, a gene therapy from Spark that treats an ultrarare blindness disorder. Luxturna goes for $425,000 per eye. This ""sets a useful precedent"" for pricing other gene-based treatments, such as hemophilia gene therapies, he says.""We believe the manufacturers are testing the waters currently as they embark on Phase 3 trials in order to determine where payers push back significantly,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Based on our checks, a price somewhere in the range of $1 million to $2 million per patient seems most likely.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe challenge with pricing gene therapies is that these treatments are being billed as one-time cures, which could warrant a higher price. But most analysts doubt that will actually be the case. Further, they expect payers to push back on high prices without data to back up the therapies' durability.An agreement with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care to cover Luxturna is based on 30 months of durability data. That sets an important precedent, Schwartz said. By the time they come to market, the slew of hemophilia gene therapies currently under investigation will have 30-50 months of durability data.Schwartz expects BioMarin to lead Spark in treating hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a genetic deficiency in a key blood-clotting protein known as Factor VIII. BioMarin is in Phase 3 testing of a gene therapy called valoctocogene roxaparvovec, or Valrox. Spark's therapy, SPK-8011, is in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.""We believe an effective gene therapy for hemophilia could garner at least 2.5 times the annual cost of Factor (VIII) replacement therapy based on durable (effectiveness) data,"" Schwartz said.BioMarin could enter the hemophilia A market in 2022 and hit peak sales of $4.5 billion in 2030, he said. Spark will likely enter the market a year later with SPK-8011. Schwartz calls for SPK-8011 to garner $4 billion in peak sales in 2030.Spark also is working on a hemophilia B gene therapy called SPK-9001, under a partnership with Dow Jones stock Pfizer (PFE). There, it trails UniQure's therapy called AMT-061. AMT-061 is expected to begin Phase 3 studies in the third quarter. SPK-9001 is in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.Schwartz models peak sales of SPK-9001 at $1 billion in 2027 with Spark receiving $134 million in peak royalties. He boosted his price target on Spark to 74 from 55, and kept his market perform rating. He also raised his price target on BioMarin to 145 from 132, and reiterated his outperform rating.On the stock market today, UniQure popped 4.9% to close at 30.39. Spark advanced 3.6% to finish at 73.21. BioMarin gained 1.9% to close at 86.97.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

1153,KEY,"The monthly IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a collaboration of Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, gauges how confident consumers, workers and investors are in the pace and direction of the U.S. economy. As with all of IBD/TIPP's proprietary monthly indexes, a reading above 50 signals optimism, below 50 pessimism.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is made up of three subindexes, including one for the respondent's outlook six months into the future, the respondent's personal financial outlook, and how the respondent views current federal policies. The goal each month is to give as accurate a reading of the current state of the economy as possible.The average for the index over the past 17 years has been 49.4, or slightly pessimistic. The index high of 62.9 was reached in March of 2002, six months after the 9/11 attacks, as Americans rallied behind the U.S. response to the terrorist attacks and confidence grew that the post-9/11 economy would not go into recession as widely feared. The index bottomed in August 2011 at 35.8, as the economy struggled to emerge from the financial crisis and key initiatives to boost economic growth had yet to have an impact.IBD/TIPP also produces the Presidential Leadership Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose 1.9% in May to 53.6 from 52.6 in April, reversing two monthly declines. In February, the index hit its highest reading since October 2004. It's the 20th straight month that it has been over 50 — which signals overall optimism about the economy. It is also above its long-term average of 49.4. The index stood at 44.4 in December 2007, the month that the U.S. officially entered a recession.The Six-Month Outlook is a forward-looking gauge that looks at how consumers feel about the economy's prospects over the next half year. The index rose 3.2% in May to 51.3 after dropping 6% in April and 8% in March. The volatile gauge surged 11.4% in January. The reading for this index remains in optimistic territory and well above its long-term average of 46.3. This index stood at 32.1 in December 2007, the month the economy fell into recession.The gauge of how Americans feel about their own finances in the next six months inched up 0.5% to 61.0 in May from 60.7 in April, it dropped 4.9%. The index's all-time high of 65.3 was set in January 2004, when the Bush-era tax cuts began to kick in. The Personal Financial Outlook is one of the most consistently optimistic indexes in the IBD/TIPP data set. It remains above its long-term average of 57.1.A measure of Americans' confidence in government, the Federal Policies component increased 2.3% in May to 48.5 from 47.4 in April, but was still below its level of 50 in March. It remains above its 17-year average of 44.8. This index briefly moved into optimistic territory in February 2017 for the first time in 10 years, and in March returned to the feel-good zone. But it subsided during recent budget and gun-control debates. Intended to gauge how Americans view government policies put in place by the president, Congress, the courts and the Federal Reserve, the Federal Policies Index has consistently been the least optimistic of the three subindexes that make up the Economic Optimism Index.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Presidential Approval IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsApril 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016Media ContactTerry Jones

1159,KEY,"A U.S. trade delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin traveled to China on Thursday to discuss matters related to the recent round of threatened trade tariffs. U.S. officials aim to modify restrictive trade practices. China's representatives look to dismantle U.S. threats to place tariffs on $50 billion worth of China-made exports to the U.S.The impact of some tariffs already in place were evident early in the week, when IHS Markit begin rolling out its global manufacturing purchasing managers index surveys. The result offered some helpful insight on the state of the global economy in April. The data also provided tariff-related insights into demand for China exports, as well as manufacturing strength in the eurozone and the U.S.Markit's U.S. manufacturing index for April just met expectations at 56.5, up from 55.6 in March. Even so, the uptick marked a ""steep improvement"" in operating conditions across the U.S., the report said, lifting the index to its highest mark since September 2014.The downside: Inflation of input prices and output charges rose at its fastest rate since 2011. The release cited ""greater global demand for raw materials and recently introduced tariffs"" as key factors driving costs.Manufacturing growth continued to slow in the eurozone. The final PMI reading of 56.2 was a 13-month low, down from 56.6 in March. Germany, Netherlands and Austria were the zone's top-performing economies. However, both Netherlands and Germany were among the five eurozone countries reporting slowing growth for the month. Production increased in France and Ireland.Investment goods held up as the eurozone's top-performing sector, although the sector's growth slowed slightly. Intermediate goods — auto engines, steel, sugar — took the brunt of the slowdown. Production of consumer goods increased, but continued to lag overall growth.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSlower new orders and employment drove the overall index's decrease, although those — and a number of other key metrics — held at healthy levels. (Any index reading above 50 indicates expansion.) Backlogs continued to increase. Manufacturing employment rose for a 44th straight month.In China, a marginal improvement in operating conditions lifted the country's PMI manufacturing index to 51.1. That was an uptick from March's 51 tally, and better than the 50.9 that economists expected.Inflation pressure was muted. But new order growth slowed, purchasing activity was listless and inventories began to rise.The most worrisome indicator: International demand for China goods weakened, as new export sales slipped for the first time since November 2016.Company purchasing increased, keeping pace with the slower rise in new orders. Delivery times lengthened, but only moderately, as suppliers wrestled with capacity issues. Inflation remained in check, with input prices unchanged and output charges seeing a narrow gain.RELATED:Markets Whipsawed As China Trade War, Trump Impeachment Fears RiseAlibaba, Carbon Black IPO, Jobs Report: Investing Action Plan No Fed Rate Hike, But Here's Why The Dow Jones Can't Get A Head Of Steam5 Key Ways To Play Alibaba, Baidu And Other Top China Stocks This Oil Giant Jumps Into Buy Zone But Permian Play Struggles To Hold Entry

1165,KEY,"Even the best stocks eventually start to waver and break down. It's a law of the market. So, recognizing those signals is crucial in learning how to invest with consistent success. Don't focus simply on buying. Learn how to keep your hard-earned gains in a hot stock and sell at the right time.XIndeed, mastering IBD's more than two dozen sell rules will help you succeed over the long term in the stock market.Some of those signs are as obvious as a hammer to the head, like a gap down on earnings. Others are more subtle, like a low-volume rebound after a sharp break. Normally, multiple sell signals coincide, giving investors both upside and downside reasons to sell a stock and lock in profits.Let's take a look at Ambarella (AMBA) in the summer of 2015. The system-on-a-chip designer made a big move due to its relationship with GoPro (GPRO). GoPro — the hyped camera-on-a-stick maker — went public at a 24 IPO price and quickly ran up to 98.47. But that lofty valuation was quickly shattered. The stock plummeted to an all-time low of 4.42 just this month — 95% off that all-time high. This year, the company announced that it was leaving the drone market due to an extremely competitive aerial market.Ambarella broke out above a 33.91 buy point in a cup with handle on Aug. 29, 2014 (please see a historical chart at MarketSmith). From there, the stock did a solid job of maintaining its 10-week line — a key support level. The week ended Feb. 13, 2015, saw the stock close significantly below its 10-week line for the first time since the breakout. But volume was just slightly above average. When you see a severe break below the 10-week line in volume that jumps 40% above average, it's time to sell.Three months later, the stock went into a climax top, allowing investors to lock in a big gain, while the stock was still advancing.On June 22, shares plunged nearly 21% (1) to 94.36 in huge turnover. Short-seller firm Citron Research published a report calling its stock appreciation ""ridiculous."" Investors couldn't be blamed for selling some shares that day given it was the stock's biggest one-day point break since the start of the move — a defense-type sell signal.Over the next month, the stock would slowly rebound back to new highs. The price action was positive, but volume was clearly telling a different tale. Only one day, July 23, showed a significant increase in volume vs. the 50-day average (2), but it was a stalling action. That day, shares rallied as much as 5.5% to hit a new high at 129.19, but closed with a meek 0.4% gain. Institutions anxiously unloaded their positions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

However, March's wage gain was also revised down, from 2.7% to 2.6%.Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that other gauges of wage growth have pointed to stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index released last week showed that private-sector wages and salaries grew 2.9% from a year ago in March.After the jobs data, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 2.935% while the 2-year yield, which more closely tracks Fed rate expectations, held around 2.49%.

The combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy.

1173,KEY,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes. He says future inventors will use both the science and the fiction of the past to inspire smart clothing designs.""I think a lot of our movies in the past got the future pretty right. Even with 'Back To The Future,' Nike released self-tying sneakers so that became a reality,"" Clinton said. ""In lots of ways fiction and entertainment inspire entrepreneurs to create the products they think are really cool when they see movies as kids.""As the next generation thinks about what they can build on top of these products, innovation will just compound.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

The hedge fund sees such a move reversing years of underperformance; realizing the full potential of the company's franchise assets; and fixing problems for the advanced Geared Turbofan jet engine from United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney unit.The letter spoke of a new ""significant stake"" in the $100 billion industrial giant, which had already been reported in March.United Technologies countered in a statement that it ""disagrees with several of the assertions"" in the Third Point letter, without specifying which. It added a full portfolio review should be completed this year, after the pending acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL) closes. CEO Greg Hayes has said he is mulling a breakup of core businesses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Third Point's letter made note of United Tech's ""weak operating performance"" and added ""a three-way split would unlock in excess of $20 billion of value,"" net of separation costs.Third Point added: ""UTC fits a pattern of many underperforming conglomerates where value is diminished by the ill effects of a 'one size fits all' approach to corporate strategy, incentive compensation, and capital allocation."" A history of poor management led most recently to the ""botched ramp-up"" of the next-generation geared turbofan (GTF) engine, it said.Some Wall Street analysts expected the GTF to be a profit driver. But problems with the jet engine led to grounded flights and tensions with aircraft maker Airbus (EADSY).Meanwhile, rival jet engine maker General Electric (GE) reports deliveries of its next-gen Leap are behind schedule. A GE unit made the Boeing (BA) jet engine that blew apart midair in April.Some analysts have argued that struggling General Electric should break up. GE has divested NBCUniversal and most of GE Capital over the past several years. Meanwhile, DowDuPont (DWDP), the recent union of Dow Chemical and DuPont, aims to split into three more-focused companies.United Technologies, GE and DowDuPont are all Dow Jones components, as is Boeing.Shares of United Technologies popped 1.5% on the stock market today after hitting a seven-month low Thursday. GE rose 1.3%, back above its 50-day line but still near long-term lows.

1183,KEY,"A stock market correction can make investing prospects seem bleak. Your batting average suffers and it's hard to feel in step. But don't give up. Stocks showing relative strength during these times deserve special attention. They can bring the best swing trading profits when the market firms up.A return of volatility has already made the start of 2018 more challenging than 2017. January continued to build on the strength of the prior year but then things shifted. February saw more than a 10% correction in the Nasdaq composite. March was back to new highs. By the start of April, another correction of over 10% was underway. With the back-and-forth, making progress hasn't been easy.The fact that 2017 had no 10% stock market corrections was unusual. So, it may be helpful to revisit the stock market corrections of 2016 for insight to the current market conditions — and a ray of hope.The beginning of 2016 had its share of turbulence. January started with a rally failure and by February the Nasdaq composite languished nearly 20% off its high. A follow-through day in February offered a slow start for growth stocks initially. Still, there were plenty of successful swing trading opportunities by the time IBD's SwingTrader launched its beta version in March that year. Nvidia (NVDA), TAL Education (TAL), and Silicon Motion (SIMO) were among those early winners.The strong rally into April hit resistance just under 5000. Soon enough, the index was back below its 50-day moving average line and our batting average on SwingTrader started to suffer. But, as the stock market firmed, the stocks with spectacular relative strength stuck out. Semiconductor stock MaxLinear (MXL) was one of them.MaxLinear broke out of a base-on-base structure with double its average volume on May 16 (1). Its move to new highs occurred while the market was still recovering. That pushed its relative strength line to new highs sharply (1) and earned it a spot on SwingTrader.IBD'S TAKE: Relative Strength isn't just for swing trading. It was a factor for IBD's Leaderboard in picking Lululemon (LULU) as a winner. Though the stock didn't go straight up immediately, the 5-day moving average line easily contained its drops. By May 23, MaxLinear hit its 5% profit goal and we took half profits on the trade (2). As the market's strength grew, the semiconductor stock continued to pile on gains. The 10% profit goal hit on May 31 and we exited the remaining shares (3). The Nasdaq composite approached its prior resistance level of 5000 around the same time.Taking profits on the way up didn't get us out at the top. It usually doesn't. But it did save us the heartache of a nearly 20% correction in MaxLinear that transpired over the next month. More importantly, stocks showing relative strength when things look bleak can be your key to profits when the eventual market turn comes.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Relative Strength Line Identifies Strong StocksHere's How Swing Trading Strategy Helped Avoid A Stock Market Correction Swing Trading Strategies And Lessons

Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in well above Tuesday's levels.Merck (MRK) and Walmart (WMT) were top gainers in the Dow, up 2% to 2.5%.Chip names in the Nasdaq 100 lagged again as names like Microchip (MCHP), Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC) and Lam Research (LRCX) ended with losses of 2% or more.The bond market was quiet as the 10-year Treasury yield was mostly unchanged at 2.77%.In the stock market today, FANG stock Amazon.com (AMZN) recovered off lows but still lost 4% on renewed reports that President Trump is considering additional taxes and other regulations for the internet retailer that's become a formidable rival to brick-and-mortar retailers, including department stores and sporting goods chains.Fellow FANG name Netflix (NFLX) also took heat, falling 5%. It's testing support at the 50-day moving average for the first time after a breakout from a flat base in early January.Retail stocks turned in solid performances, helped by strong earnings from Leaderboard name Lululemon Athletica (LULU). Shares jumped 9%. Other retail names holding up well in a weak market tape include Urban Outfitters (URBN), American Eagle (AEO) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). Results from Ollie's are due April 4 after the close.In merger news, oil and gas producer Concho Resources (CXO) plunged nearly 9% on news that it's acquiring RSP Permian (RSPP) for around $8 billion in stock.

1185,KEY,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will hold its annual meeting on Saturday in Omaha, an event likely to draw thousands seeking financial enlightenment from Warren Buffett, the conglomerate's billionaire CEO and Wall Street's quintessential grandfather figure.Here's a look at what to expect from the meeting that has been called the Woodstock of Capitalism.Buffett, in his 2017 shareholder letter, said ""America's economic soil remains fertile."" While President Trump has cut corporate taxes, he's also threatened to start a trade war with China. Markets also are worried about inflation and Fed rate hikes. Those developments could color whatever sweeping declarations Buffett might make about the nation's economy.In September, a JPMorgan analyst wrote that Buffett, 87, ""shows no signs of slowing and could possibly be at the helm for another decade."" But in January, Buffett appointed two insiders — Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain — to Berkshire Hathaway's board. He said they are ""key figures"" that ""both have Berkshire in their blood."" Wall Street will be listening for additional details.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBuffett owns a ton of shares in Apple (AAPL) and Wells Fargo (WFC). He could offer more detail about why he's loaded up on the iPhone maker. He could also discuss the struggling Wells Fargo, which the Federal Reserve has barred from growing until the bank cleans itself up after several scandals surrounding its sales practices.Meanwhile, RBC analyst Deane Dray sees General Electric (GE) as ""an ideal Warren Buffett investment."" Buffett bailed on GE stock last August. But Dray noted that earlier this year Buffett told CNBC that he would buy the industrial giant ""at the right price."" Buffett has rescued other big, ailing legacy businesses in the past.Then there's the $100 billion in capital that Berkshire is sitting on. Investors, almost certainly, will be hoping to get a sense of whether Buffett might use it to buy a company, or more Apple stock, or put it toward a dividend.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, in his own annual shareholder letter, offered some early but very broad details of the bank's health care collaboration with Berkshire and Amazon (AMZN). If Dimon can do it, maybe Buffett will too.The companies in January said they would partner on ""ways to address health care for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs,"" and create an ""independent company that is free from profit-making incentives.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Warren Buffett-Backed Oil Refiner Phillips 66 Earnings Top ViewsBerkshire Hathaway Shows Rising Relative Price Performance; Still Shy Of Key ThresholdBlockchain Health Alliance Follows Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan PactWill Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett Buy Up GE Stock?

1195,KEY,"Riding the broad stock market's modest rally in April, many of the best mutual funds clawed their way up last month. Market volatility has increased amid growing signs that interest rates will keep rising. Stocks, bonds and the mutual funds that invest in them are in for more of the same in the months ahead, according to experts at Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Ameriprise Financial (AMP).That market scenario points to opportunities in growth stocks, says Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab Investment Management's chief investment officer of equities. ""The market will recognize growth in earnings as a key driver,"" he said. ""Companies that are using extra cash from tax reform and generating capital expenditures, investing in innovative products and ideas, those companies will benefit. Companies that are more yield sensitive will have a harder time being attractive.""But Ameriprise chief market strategist David Joy warns not to count on leadership from the growth stocks that have been highfliers for the past year or more. Many familiar growth names have grown pricey, he cautions.The S&P 500's 0.38% April advance reclaimed some of its 2.54% setback in March. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds fought through weakness late in the month to scratch out a 0.27% gain for April after falling 0.93% in March.Small-cap value funds' 0.81% April gain led the meager rally by U.S. diversified stock funds.One key hurdle for stock funds in April was the rise in yield on the 10-year Treasury. Late in April, the yield briefly topped 3%. ""That offered investors increasingly decent income with lower risk (than stocks), so it drew investor money away from equities,"" Aguilar said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFear of a trade war also contributed to stocks' downward volatility. ""But that fear was greater in March,"" Aguilar said.In addition, many investors were concerned that the U.S. economy isn't growing fast enough. First-quarter GDP growth was 2.3%, slowest in a year. Yet that beat the widely forecast expectation of 2%.""Corporate earnings, stock valuations, overall economic growth — all ended up being positive,"" Aguilar said. ""And we're still just in the early stages of seeing benefits from fiscal stimulus. But all of those positives were clouded by high yields in fixed income.""World equity funds' slim 0.12% advance lagged the modest gain by U.S. diversified stock funds. Yet that was an improvement on their 0.85% loss in March. India region funds' 3.06% April gain led foreign stock fund categories.Natural resources funds paced sectors, gaining 8.58% last month, fueled by the uptrend in oil prices.Taxable bonds funds, many of them filled with older bonds, were hurt by climbing rates on average. Treasury funds fell 1.37%. High-yield funds were among the few categories to gain ground, rising 0.44%.Tax-exempt bond funds also retreated.Going forward, Aguilar likes companies that are investing in innovative products and ideas. ""Consumer discretionary, technology and health care are sectors where you find many companies like that,"" he said.Take a look at $10.4 billion Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund (POAGX), a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.

1196,KEY,"If a major company needs capital or a private firm wants to sell, Warren Buffett's checkbook is often the one they seek out. Will that stay the case when it's someone else's signature?XThat was the question from several Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) shareholders at the firm's annual meeting Saturday, adding a fresh angle to the topic of succession for the 87-year-old chairman. Berkshire's desire to utilize a cash pile that has grown to more than $100 billion makes finding large-scale deals a key issue for whoever will be the conglomerate's next leader.Buffett downplayed any unique skill he has to drum up deals, using his inability to find recent ones as evidence. Berkshire often makes large investments in times of panic, when its stable capital, and not the Buffett name, is the allure, he argued.""The reputation belongs to Berkshire now,"" Buffett said at the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. ""We are the first call and will continue to be the first call.""Charlie Munger, Buffett's 94-year-old vice chairman, said already most acquisitions are coming from the chiefs of the company's operating subsidiaries, not he and Buffett.""It's happening more there than it is at headquarters,"" he said.Although Buffett named two vice chairs this year in a step toward succession, he didn't directly address the race for his heir at the meeting.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOverall, the meeting had a similar feel to recent years. Buffett and Munger traded one-liners and fielded a few tough questions. But, by and large, the two managed to charm their fans again and keep most of them in their seats for the entire six-hour session. Here were some other topics of interest.Investors got some detail on the performance of the two men Buffett has handed some of his stock-picking duties. The billionaire said the deputies have both ""slightly"" beat the S&P 500 Index since they started managing Berkshire's money.Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who together oversee about $25 billion, have almost identical performance since they joined, Buffett said. Combs was hired by Berkshire in late 2010 and Weschler joined about a year later. While Buffett said their performance roughly amounts to matching the S&P 500, they've received some incentive pay that they only get if they outperform that benchmark.""It's been better than I've done, so naturally I can't criticize,"" he said.Buffett tried to temper high hopes for the healthcare venture he's pursuing with Amazon (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) While he said they should name a chief executive officer in the next couple months and other companies have expressed interest in joining, Buffett acknowledged the many obstacles it faces.""We will see what happens,"" he said. Buffett and Munger were definitive in their disdain for cryptocurrencies in answer to a question at the meeting. Buffett said they will likely come to a bad ending because their value depends on someone wanting to buy them for even more money.They draw in a lot of ""charlatans"" and people of ""less than stellar character,"" Buffett said.Munger was even more forceful in his aversion to the assets.""It's just disgusting,"" he said. It's like ""somebody else is trading turds and you decide 'I can't be left out.'""The pair were confident that trade tensions between the world's two largest economies wouldn't escalate into something that derails progress.

1197,KEY,"If a major company needs capital or a private firm wants to sell, Warren Buffett's checkbook is often the one they seek out. Will that stay the case when it's someone else's signature?XThat was the question from several Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) shareholders at the firm's annual meeting Saturday, adding a fresh angle to the topic of succession for the 87-year-old chairman. Berkshire's desire to utilize a cash pile that has grown to more than $100 billion makes finding large-scale deals a key issue for whoever will be the conglomerate's next leader.Buffett downplayed any unique skill he has to drum up deals, using his inability to find recent ones as evidence. Berkshire often makes large investments in times of panic, when its stable capital, and not the Buffett name, is the allure, he argued.""The reputation belongs to Berkshire now,"" Buffett said at the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. ""We are the first call and will continue to be the first call.""Charlie Munger, Buffett's 94-year-old vice chairman, said already most acquisitions are coming from the chiefs of the company's operating subsidiaries, not he and Buffett.""It's happening more there than it is at headquarters,"" he said.Although Buffett named two vice chairs this year in a step toward succession, he didn't directly address the race for his heir at the meeting.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOverall, the meeting had a similar feel to recent years. Buffett and Munger traded one-liners and fielded a few tough questions. But, by and large, the two managed to charm their fans again and keep most of them in their seats for the entire six-hour session. Here were some other topics of interest.Investors got some detail on the performance of the two men Buffett has handed some of his stock-picking duties. The billionaire said the deputies have both ""slightly"" beat the S&P 500 Index since they started managing Berkshire's money.Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who together oversee about $25 billion, have almost identical performance since they joined, Buffett said. Combs was hired by Berkshire in late 2010 and Weschler joined about a year later. While Buffett said their performance roughly amounts to matching the S&P 500, they've received some incentive pay that they only get if they outperform that benchmark.""It's been better than I've done, so naturally I can't criticize,"" he said.Buffett tried to temper high hopes for the healthcare venture he's pursuing with Amazon (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) While he said they should name a chief executive officer in the next couple months and other companies have expressed interest in joining, Buffett acknowledged the many obstacles it faces.""We will see what happens,"" he said. Buffett and Munger were definitive in their disdain for cryptocurrencies in answer to a question at the meeting. Buffett said they will likely come to a bad ending because their value depends on someone wanting to buy them for even more money.They draw in a lot of ""charlatans"" and people of ""less than stellar character,"" Buffett said.Munger was even more forceful in his aversion to the assets.""It's just disgusting,"" he said. It's like ""somebody else is trading turds and you decide 'I can't be left out.'""The pair were confident that trade tensions between the world's two largest economies wouldn't escalate into something that derails progress. And they were bullish on the prospects for China.Buffett suggested he should do a deal in China this year because of the luck of the number eight there -- and his turning age 88 in August.

1198,KEY,"Nike (NKE) stock moved above a key technical support Tuesday as the company gears up for the release of its third quarter earnings later this week.Wall Street is currently looking for EPS to fall 23.5% to 52 cents when results are released Thursday, according to Zacks Investment Research. However revenue is expected to jump by 4.9% to $8.84 billion. Nike has managed to beat views on EPS for the past six quarters and has usually exceeded expectations on revenue, though it fell short for the same quarter last year.Analysts have been positive on the Dow Jones Industrial Average component's performance, with Cowen's  John Kernan recently giving raised quarterly estimates and a price target increase to 68 for the stock.

Global growth, particularly in the Chinese market where the NBA is experiencing a popular boom, is seen another driver that will offset a wholesale sales decline in North America.""We estimate Nike will generate $4.9 billion in China sales in 2018.

1201,KEY,"Adidas (ADDYY) is under fire Thursday for not cutting ties with Yeezy creator Kanye West over his widely criticized comments earlier this week about slavery, just as the sportswear brand's first-quarter report suggests it's losing momentum in the key North America market.XWest, who has been designing his Yeezy brand footwear for Adidas since 2013, riled up the cybersphere Tuesday after alluding to entertainment news outlet TMZ that slavery might have been a ""choice.""""When you hear about slavery for 400 years — for 400 years?! That sounds like a choice,"" he said.Adidas tried to distance itself from his comments without cutting ties with the rapper himself.""Kanye has been, and is, a very important part of our strategy and has been a fantastic creator, and that's where I'm going to leave it,"" Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted told Bloomberg TV. ""I'm not going to comment on every comment that he or somebody else are making. That's pretty much the party line at this stage.""But Rorsted told analysts on the earnings call ""there are some remarks that we don't support,"" according to Reuters.

However, Kanye and Yeezy's significance to the company was ""less so"" from a revenue perspective.It's not clear how widespread the damage from West's comments could be, but at least one analyst sees potential harm for the Adidas brand.""Kanye West's recent controversial comments could create backlash among core Adidas consumers and toward the Yeezy brand in particular,"" wrote Cowen's John Kernan.Twitter is aflame with criticism of both Adidas and Kanye.

1206,KEY,"Celgene (CELG) ""nailed it"" in the first quarter after delivering a broad beat-and-raise Friday, analysts said, but they questioned the timeline for the release of its key multiple sclerosis drug.Analysts were split on whether the first-quarter beat was enough to outweigh concerns about the MS drug, dubbed ozanimod. The Food and Drug Administration punted Celgene's application for ozanimod in February. Now, Celgene expects to refile for approval in early 2019.The ""modest beat fails to offset more development setbacks,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.

Adjusted profit of $2.05 a share beat the consensus for $2 and grew nearly 23%.Revenue from cancer drugs outperformed expectations. Revlimid brought in $2.23 billion, in line with the consensus and up 19%, Porges said. Pomalyst raked in $453 million, growing 24.5% to beat views by 3%. Abraxane generated $262 million, up 11% and topping by 6%.In immunology, sales of psoriasis and arthritis drug Otezla grew 46% to $353 million. That was 2% above the consensus, Porges said, but down 5% sequentially. In the U.S., increased demand and improved access helped spike sales, Celgene said in a news release.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said Celgene ""nailed it"" for an ""awesome quarter.""""All products came in line or beat slightly,"" he said in a note. ""Total product revenues beat by $100 million and the company slightly raised the 2018 guide on the top and bottom line.""Celgene also boosted its sales guidance for 2018 to $14.8 billion, up from earlier views for $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion. The firm also sees earnings of $8.45 a share, adjusted for the recent acquisition of Juno Therapeutics. Analysts had predicted $14.84 billion in sales and earnings of $8.44 a share.The big news, though, regarded ozanimod. In February, the FDA refused to file the application for ozanimod. Celgene cited deficiencies in the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections of the application for the FDA's decision.Earlier in the week, an analyst suggested that the issue came down to a specific substance within the drug, known as a metabolite. A metabolite is a substance formed in, or necessary for, metabolism. Celgene discovered this specific metabolite in later-stage testing in humans.RBC's Abrahams noted that this specific metabolite, known as CC112273, seems to stay in the body much longer than researchers initially realized. It's also responsible for about 90% of the drug's activity, he said in a report to clients.""However, the longer half-life should not be a major issue once the metabolite is characterized,"" he said. ""Other drugs in the class, like Gilenya, also have half-lives in similar ranges.""Now, Celgene expects to refile its application for ozanimod in multiple sclerosis in the first quarter of 2019. This timeline ""takes the uber bear case of a two-plus-year delay off the table,"" Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note.But it also means that Celgene's ozanimod, if approved, will be entering the market at about the same time as generic versions of Novartis' (NVS) rival drug Gilenya, Leerink's Porges said.""The new timeline is three quarters behind what we have forecast and may put the commercial launch in some uncertainty given the expected entry of generic Gilenya,"" he said. But he kept his outperform rating on Celgene stock.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

The 500 ran up 19.4% in 2017.Tableau, meanwhile, gapped out of a base-on-base pattern at 87.70, rising more than 7% to 91.30 in quadruple normal volume.Tableau is a Big Data analytics software expert. The Seattle-based firm notched its fourth quarter in a row of solid earnings per share. Revenue climbed 23% to $246.2 million, the biggest jump in five quarters.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Tableau's so-so 68 Composite Rating belies a strong 89 RS Rating, meaning the company is outperforming 89% of all publicly traded firms in IBD's database over the past 12 months. Given Thursday's strong advance, watch to see if Tableau's ratings edge higher.Going back to Apple, the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan acted stingy in giving back Wednesday's strong gain, a good sign for the bulls. The stock initially fell more than 1% to 174.63 in brisk trade. Then it wiped out those modest losses to end 0.2% higher to 176.89.The megacap tech is possibly forming the right side of a shallow seven-week double-bottom base. The middle peak between the base's  two lows is 178.94. Hence, a new buy point would be 179.04, 10 cents above that middle peak. The decline within the base is very light at 12.5%.Apple is still trading near all-time highs, another bullish sign. At $897 billion, it's the largest company by market value on the U.S. financial markets. In IBD Stock Checkup, the Cupertino, Calif., firm shows decent ratings such as an 85 for EPS (Earnings Per Share) and 86 for Relative Price Strength.Earlier this week the iPhone giant reported a 30% jump in fiscal second-quarter earnings to $2.73 a share, the biggest jump in 10 quarters, as revenue grew 16%, marking a sixth quarter in a row of top-line acceleration.Apple's revenue slumped 9% during the fiscal fourth quarter of FY 2016, then rose 3%, 5%, 7%, 12% and 13% in the next five quarters.The Street expects Apple's earnings turnaround to keep shining brightly. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect profit to climb 30% in the June-ending fiscal third quarter to $2.17 a share.Despite the nifty reversal by the major indexes, investors also seem to show nervousness on the outcome of two-day trade talks between top U.S. and Chinese economic officials in Beijing.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and other key players arrived in the Middle Kingdom on Thursday for talks later in the day and Friday.Bloomberg reported a senior Chinese government official as saying that China will refuse any U.S. preconditions for negotiations, such as narrowing the bilateral trade gap.On Friday, a number of top Federal Reserve officials and regional bank presidents are slated to speak, including William Dudley, John Williams, and Esther George. On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank kept short-term interest rates unchanged. The fed funds rate that's charged on overnight cash infusions to major lenders currently hovers at a 1.5%-1.75% target range.CME futures see a nearly 45% probability that the Fed will raise the fed funds rate three more times to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%, slightly down from recent days. Numerous money center banks, Wall Street investment giants and regional lenders have recently been hit with intense selling.Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Bank of America (BAC) have either sliced below or came close to touching their 200-day moving averages.

1208,KEY,"Paycom Software (PAYC) gets plastered by sellers after posting Q1 results late Tuesday, down as much as 10%. Former IBD 50 name Zoetis (ZTS) is slammed more than 7% after its Thursday report.And just a few weeks earlier, Micron Technology (MU) is sent packing to the showers, batted down nearly 20% in the span of 10 trading sessions. Why? March 22. Good fiscal Q2 numbers.Sense a pattern here?The months of January, April, July and October never fail to remind investors how stocks can soar or plunge on quarterly results. This peculiar pattern, in a way, presents a challenge to all U.S. stock investors. Have you been trading stocks the IBD way for a few months or for a few decades? All it takes is just a few quarterly results among high-powered growth stocks to know the risks of holding a big position right before the news.Earnings results are Wall Street's version of the double-edged sword.You're a smart trader. Your goal: maximize the profits in big winners and minimize losses in weaker plays. So, consider these four suggestions that can help you navigate choppy waters. They likely carry more weight now as IBD's current outlook stands at ""uptrend under pressure.""Tip 1: Study the stock's long-term character. Let's revisit Paycom. The HR management software firm and Leaderboard name cleared a base Feb. 9, 2017, a day after posting exceptional results (EPS up 80% in Q4 2016, revenue up 35%). But a pair of key follow-on buy points came in between quarterly results. The first and second pullbacks to the 10-week moving average came during the weeks ended March 31 and June 16 the same year.However, Abiomed (ABMD) has acted differently. The heart-pump firm broke out of a long cup with handle at 126.49 during the week ended April 28, 2017, a week before it shared fiscal Q4 results.A more recent breakout past a five-week flat base at 200.48 took place on Jan. 5 this year, three weeks before the next quarterly report.Tip 2: Count, count, count. That is, check the number of bases that stocks in your portfolio have created. Has your stock built a third, fourth or fifth base? Chances of a severe post-earnings slide go up. (Readers can use the pattern recognition service on MarketSmith to save time in counting bases.)A stock must rise at least 20% from a correct entry point in a primary base or the top of a base on base before it can form the next-stage base.If your stock is in an earnings turnaround and you scooped shares on an early-stage breakout, you likely may see more strong quarterly results ahead that can keep the rally humming. Apple (AAPL) is not an IBD 50 play, but it still serves as perhaps one of the finest examples in 2017. Through the March quarter, the iPhone giant has now strung together five straight quarters of double-digit profit growth. That's not easy for a firm that logged $229 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017.Tip 3: Pocket your gains on the way up. Have you heard of the expression, ""betting with house money""? It means you've sold part of your position in a winning stock and no one can take those profits away. But you keep some shares to participate in further upside. A great earnings report can carry a market leader further. But it's smart portfolio strategy to at least snatch partial gains when your stock rises 20% to 25% past the most recent breakout point. Want to aim for 30%, 40% profits? Sure. But never forget that most pigs get slaughtered.Tip 4: Check the Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Has this proprietary measure, found in Stock Checkup and in IBD's stock research tables, weakened in recent weeks? If so, perhaps institutions have been dumping more shares than usual. Why? They may lack confidence about the upcoming three-month results or next quarter's outlook. This rating studies price-and-volume interaction over the past 13 weeks.Trade the IBD 50 in one click with the Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Funds.

Teva cited price erosion in the U.S. for the slide. But in Europe, Teva's generic drugs climbed 17% to $997 million.

Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) was flat after giving up an earlier gain. It's 29% below its 50-day line and 72% off its December peak.Many of the biggest dividend paying exchange traded products (ETPs) focus on the real estate and energy sectors. Why?Real estate investment trusts (REITs), for instance, must pass along at least 90% of their income to shareholders in exchange for lower tax rates than regular corporations. That translates into often hefty dividend payouts.Master limited partnerships (MLPs), which dominate the funds in the accompanying chart, have a similar structure. They also pass the lion's share of their cash flow through to investors as payouts. Since that cash flow doesn't get booked as income, MLPs get a tax break.  InfraCap MLP (AMZA) topped the list with a whopping 33.6% annualized yield, according to Morningstar Direct. The $557.5 million fund's top five holdings as of April 6 were Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), MPLX (MPLX), Williams Partners (WPZ), Andeavor Logistics (ANDX) and Buckeye Partners (BPL). They made up nearly 56% of the 36-stock portfolio. AMZA is trading near two-year lows and is 25% off its 52-week high.

1227,KEY,"Through Monday, inverter specialist SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) held the No. 1 spot within the IBD 50 for a ninth consecutive week.For some IBD readers, that may feel a bit scary. Others may think it's a good time to engage in short selling.What does the chart say?On Feb. 15, SolarEdge catapulted out of a new double-bottom base with a buy point of 39.75. The spark? A 166% leap in profit in the fourth quarter to 85 cents a share. A 70% acceleration in revenue to $189 million drove that huge boost in the bottom line.Two days after that wonderful breakout in huge volume, the Israeli company stretched its gain to 20%. In strong bull markets, a 20% gain in three weeks or less triggers a special rule to hold the stock for a minimum of eight weeks, then reassess the stock. Given that we're relatively late in the current bull market cycle, one can decide to follow that rule or take at least some gains when any stock achieves such a handsome profit from the proper buy point.Eight weeks after the Feb. 15 breakout, SolarEdge traded as high as 59.20. That pushed the post-breakout gain to 48%.Patience was rewarded.And now, as noted in the annotated charts in IBD Leaderboard, SolarEdge is testing support at the key 50-day and 10-week moving averages. A big rebound off either of these chart-interpretation tools, ideally in heavy turnover, would provide alert investors with a chance to add shares to a winning position. Read more about this technique in this Investor's Corner column.SolarEdge's big revenue increase in Q4, to a best-ever $189 million, marked a third quarter in a row of top-line acceleration. In the first quarter of 2017, revenue slipped 8% but then jumped 9% in Q2 and another 30% in Q3. The Street sees revenue rising 59% in the first quarter of 2018 to $204.5 million.Through April 27, IBD's solar energy industry group ranked No. 4 among 197 industry groups.

(Learn more about how to use an HSA and changes in HSA rules for 2018 elsewhere in this special report.)Jon Robb, senior vice president at HSA research firm Devenir, says people should be ""thinking about how they are going to be using HSAs.""""If you're going to be using it as a transactional kind of account for spending, then focus on debit-card functionality and online banking options,"" he said. ""If you are looking to use it more for investment and retirement planning, look at the long-term investment options that are offered and pay attention to fees.""If you're interested in using your health savings account to boost retirement savings, look for robust HSA investment options offered by providers. Many top companies in this category offer a varied choice of top-performing mutual funds. You also may be able to pick your own stocks, bonds and ETFs. Fidelity Investments is among the leaders in this category, as are HSA Bank, Further (formerly named SelectAccount), Saturna HSA and HealthSavings Administrators.Administrators highlighted for investment quality offer funds that generally outperformed their peers, according to Morningstar. HealthEquity, Optum Bank and HSA Authority excelled in this category.Being able to invest without a minimum balance can also be an attractive incentive.

1236,KEY,"Rising interest rates aren't bothering Joseph Eberhardy, a manager of Wells Fargo Growth Fund (SGRAX), so maybe they should not scare you either. Instead, rising rates have whetted investors' appetites for quality growth stocks vs. defensive, dividend paying stocks in general, Eberhardy says.And history has taught Eberhardy and lead manager Tom Ognar that as long as the 10-year Treasury rate stays below 5%, leading growth stocks are safe. That bodes well in general for top holdings like Paycom Software (PAYC), Netflix (NFLX), Splunk (SPLK), Amazom.com (AMZN), PayPal (PYPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) that continue to drive the $4.7 billion portfolio's returns.""My gut says (the hindrance threshold for growth stocks) may be something less than 5% this time around, but we're not overly concerned with rates now around 3%,"" Eberhardy said.Going into Wednesday, those stocks were up this year 2% for PayPal to 60% for Netflix. Still, in the always-fluid mix of the market, the Eberhardy-Ognar team is hedging its bet on one of those leaders. (Lower in this story, we explain which one and why.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMeanwhile, the overall strategy has paid off. So far this year the fund's 5.28% advance tops 88% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and outstrips the S&P 500's 0.9% setback. Over the past 12 months the fund is up 24.23% vs. 18.56% on average for its direct rivals and 13.17% for the broad market benchmark.Key trends trump rising rates for Eberhardy. Growth stocks that Eberhardy and Ognar like the most are those with a tailwind from key secular trends. One such trend is the migration toward software as a service (SaaS). An example is Paycom, a provider of cloud-based human capital management software.But the fund has made big trims in Paycom in recent disclosures. ""Valuation was the key component for our trimming Paycom, as we thought the gap between our expectations and the market's expectations narrowed significantly,"" Eberhardy said.Paycom is trading at roughly 10 times its calendar 2019 enterprise value to sales ratio. ServiceNow (NOW) is a SaaS stock that the fund likes more. ""We like NOW better,"" Eberhardy said. With its slightly lower valuation of calendar 2019 nine times EV to sales ratio, ""we see a little more opportunity for margin expansion with NOW as they accelerate new investments into areas like HR,"" he said.The rise of cloud computing and storage is another trend the fund plays. Splunk is a hybrid play in cloud computing and SaaS, Eberhardy says. This company's software helps customers crunch big data, ""whether it's real-time monitoring for cybersecruity or helping locomotive operators optimize their driving to cut fuel costs,"" he said.Amazon is a long-time top holding and the poster child for a company capitalizing on the growth of online retail. ""They are the dominant provider in that space, and we see that continuing going forward,"" Eberhardy said. ""They also fit the cloud computing trend through their web services side. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is roughly 10% of their revenues but 90% of their total operating income.""PayPal is a leader in the digital payments trend. ""The shift from paper to digital payments benefits them, Global Payments (GPN) and Square (SQ), Eberhardy said, citing two additional holdings. ""We still feel that there's a big opportunity for all of them. PayPal stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries.""A fifth trend the fund aims to exploit is the rise of the Internet of Things. Chipmaker Nvidia is one way to play that trend. ""Whether it's on the gaming side or in autonomous vehicles, Nvidia is the clear leader,"" Eberhardy said. ""Nvidia has been the dominant provider of chips in those two spaces. Their lead, their competitive moat, is relatively stable.""Of course no stock or sector rises forever, Eberhardy cautions. ""There's still lots of opportunities in those five areas,"" he said, referring to the five trends. ""But some areas in particular, like SaaS in the last few months, have been trading toward the high end of their historical valuation ranges. That's something to watch. The other four are more fairly valued. To a lesser extent, cloud computing is closer to its higher end than its lower end.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Want Tax-Free Retirement Income?

1243,KEY,"Celgene (CELG) plunged more than 7% Monday on a report from Morgan Stanley suggesting its experimental multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod could be delayed by up to three years.But shares recovered a little as other analysts disagreed, saying the issue identified by Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison is largely a nonissue. Celgene stock lost 4.5%, at the closing bell, ending the day at 87.10. Shares rose a fraction after hours.During a recent presentation at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, Celgene noted there were some discrepancies between converting the amounts of specific substance used in preclinical studies of ozanimod in rats and monkeys to human-size doses.Harrison suggested that could be the reason the Food and Drug Administration refused to file Celgene's application for ozanimod. He further suggested it could mean a one- to three-year delay for Celgene to re-file.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Given the timeline to start the study, produce the study reports and re-file, we believe the delay is at a minimum one year and up to three years if management must redo all animal work,"" he said in a note.Celgene got ozanimod in its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos in 2015. Receptos did early studies of ozanimod in rodents for six months and in primates for nine months.Part of those studies tested the effect of a metabolite in ozanimod known as CC112273. A metabolite is a substance formed in, or necessary for, metabolism. For animal studies to be acceptable, the tests must closely mirror the impact a drug would have in humans.It appears ""exposure of CC112273 in animal models was likely below a relevant human therapeutic dose,"" Harrison said. This wasn't a problem for other metabolites. Notably, researchers discovered the issue with CC112273 in a later human study, he added.The FDA refused to file Celgene's application for ozanimod in February. Celgene cited issues in the ""non-clinical and clinical pharmacology sections"" of the application. It didn't go further into the specific problems.Celgene shares plummeted to a four-year low on that news. Also early this month, Scott Smith, a key executive who helped build up Celgene's inflammation and immunology business, unexpectedly left the company. Chief Executive Mark Alles took up his primary duties.Harrison kept his 93 price target and equal-weight rating on Celgene.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed argued if the FDA's decision on ozanimod is related to the CC112273 metabolite, it's really a nonissue. More than 4,000 human patients have taken ozanimod over two years.""If there was a deleterious effect on (effectiveness), safety or (toxicology), it would have shown up,"" he said in a report. ""Going back to introduce massively higher levels of the metabolite than animals create on their own, when we already know this does not impair safety or (effectiveness) in humans is irrelevant.""He added, ""It's creating a condition that does not exist.""Syed also performed a survey of 56 investors. Of those, 37% believe Celgene will refile with the FDA for approval in the first half of 2019. Slightly less, 36%, expect the firm to refile in the second half of 2018.RBC analyst Brian Williams believes Celgene has already begun additional preclinical work on ozanimod. Researchers discovered the CC112273 metabolite about a year ago. So even if Celgene needs to perform two years of additional study, it's already halfway through.Williams and Evercore analyst Umer Raffat also noted in separate reports that Celgene publicly brought attention to the issue in an email to analysts.""Celgene proactively drawing attention to this issue could be a signal of confidence into Friday's earnings call (and an) ozanimod filing update,"" Williams said in a note.Evercore's Raffat expects Celgene to wrap up additional studies on ozanimod as a multiple sclerosis drug in the summer. Then, it will likely re-file for approval in the late summer or early fall, he said in a note to clients.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Next Nvidia?

1244,KEY,"When scientists discovered the immense power contained in an atom, the United States government provided the laboratories, factories, and funding necessary to harness that power and end World War II. It was an unprecedented partnership of science, government, and industry, and it gave rise to the Department of Energy's National Laboratory System.In the decades since, DOE's national labs have provided scientific and technical capabilities essential for national security and competitiveness, including global leadership in supercomputing.When the nation agreed to stop underground testing of nuclear weapons, DOE's supercomputers provided the precise and sophisticated simulations necessary to ensure the arsenal's ongoing effectiveness.When scientists sought to model the universe's evolution, they brought their data to the experts and supercomputers at DOE, where they've also produced 3D images of Earth's interior that aid earthquake resilience, oil and gas discovery, and nuclear nonproliferation.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen the automotive industry needed to better understand the chemistry of engine combustion to improve efficiency, DOE's supercomputers did that, too, just as they benefit energy producers with better gas turbines, trucking companies with better aerodynamics, and consumers with better biofuels.The quiet contributions of these incredible machines — and the men and women who use them to solve the toughest problems — have kept the U.S. at the forefront of high-performance computing for decades.We have regularly developed and deployed benchmark systems and set global records for both power and scientific productivity, with an incredible range of basic science and innovation applications that impact practically every facet of our lives.The list is long, from the molecules of the human genome, to the development of new energy technologies, advanced materials and new medicines, to exploration of dark matter and understanding of the universe itself.We can push even further — and we must. It is essential for our scientific community, industry and government to work together to accelerate innovation, just as it was when our National Laboratory System began.Earlier this  month, DOE announced a Request for Proposals, worth up to $1.8 billion, for development of two to three exascale machines. Exascale computers are the next frontier for supercomputing, with speeds of l billion-billion calculations per second, an order of magnitude faster than today's machines.Our first exascale machine, Aurora, is in development at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois and is expected to come online in 2021. Aurora will use processors and architecture designed by Intel in a system built by Cray. It is expected to have more than 50,000 nodes, to use five petabytes (five million-billion bytes) of memory, and will be capable of at least one exaflops, or one quintillion calculations (that's a one followed by 18 zeros) per second.The next exascale machine will be housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee, followed by another at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. Their unique system designs will allow for distinct problem-solving approaches.Pioneering approaches to system architecture have been a key contribution of DOE national laboratories. The Titan system at ORNL, currently the nation's most powerful, deployed NVIDIA graphics processing units along with traditional central processors to increase computing power without a corresponding increase in electricity consumption. It came online in 2012, and high-performance hybrid supercomputers are now common.Our new exascale machines will allow new breakthroughs in science and industry through modeling and simulation and high-performance data analysis.Expected applications include identifying next-generation materials like exotic alloys for the defense, aerospace and energy sectors, determining optimal cancer treatments based on a patient's unique genetics, refining earth system models to more reliably assess water cycles and agricultural impacts, deciphering high-energy physics data; and accelerating industrial product design.At exascale, researchers will be able to look deeper and see farther than they ever have before. They will develop better answers to bigger questions and take on larger challenges with greater precision and speed. What's more, they will put us on the frontier, not just of exascale, but also of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).We are already developing many cutting edge AI and ML applications for our upcoming Exascale capabilities. DOE's systems have used machine learning to search through a billion combinations of drugs to find those predicted to maximally inhibit a given tumor, to search through a billion hypothetical compounds to identify those with potential as new drug development candidates, to design new materials, to develop new algorithms to manage electric grid operations, and to identify extreme climate events such as hurricanes.That is where DOE's national labs have always been: In the lead. These powerhouses of science and technology have added immeasurably to innovation and scientific discovery, national security and economic prosperity.With this week's announcement, we're on the cusp of a new frontier in supercomputing. We've made amazing progress, and we can't wait to see what the future holds.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1250,KEY,"Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk has said his company was building advantages in the ability to make electric cars cheaply and efficiently. Those claims keep looking more questionable.The latest knock against Tesla's production credentials comes from Munro & Associates, a small Detroit-area firm that disassembles new cars and analyzes them down to the nuts and bolts. Founder Sandy Munro has picked apart a Tesla Model 3 sedan. He praises its battery pack and electronics but pans much of the rest of the vehicle as costly, heavy and poorly built.For Tesla, developing the ability to mass-manufacture cars is key to its viability. Musk, who predicted programmable robots would give his electric-car maker a leg up over the rest of the auto industry, has instead confronted repeated delays and steep losses.If Munro is right, Musk may have a more lasting problem on his hands: His first car for the masses could be weightier and more expensive to build than competing models that are on the way.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

""If it would have come out even decent, they'd have mopped the floor with everybody. But they didn't.""A Tesla spokesperson didn't immediately comment.The Model 3 has great battery pack design and industry-leading electronics, according to Munro, who will elaborate on his findings to the Automotive Press Association on Wednesday. Its packs are better in terms of power and efficiency than those built by Samsung SDI or LG Chem, he said. Those two companies supply batteries for BMW AG's i3 and General Motors' (GM) Chevrolet Bolt electric cars.The circuit boards in Tesla's newest sedan also are on par in terms of complexity with those used in cell phones, high-end computers or military fighter jets, Munro said. Other carmakers should take notice.""This is not some Mickey Mouse outfit that you can just dismiss,"" he said. ""Ignore Tesla's electronics, and you're in peril.""The challenge for Tesla will be figuring out how to efficiently build the car at its assembly plant that Musk himself has said employed too much automation. In an interview earlier this month with CBS This Morning, Musk said that excessive use of robots has been one of the factors holding the company back from making more Model 3s.Musk may have to follow his hunch and hire more humans. Munro said this wouldn't be unprecedented. GM once called him in to inspect the robots the company was trying to use many years ago, before its 2009 bankruptcy.The cars weren't designed to be built with heavy use of robots, and GM ended up taking them out of the plant, he said.Munro also had some harsh words about the Model 3's design, which he said appeared to be done by someone who lacked experience in body engineering. The car has eight or 10 panels welded together that all create weight without adding strength. For a vehicle of its size, the Model 3 is the heaviest and most expensive to build, he said.The car Munro & Associates purchased and analyzed had inconsistent gaps between body panels, which Munro said may be an indication that people on the assembly line weren't properly trained.The silver lining for Tesla is that the company's biggest weakness might be fixable: there are plenty of experts available to get Tesla's factory humming.""They have a hard time with what I would classify as the dinosaur technologies, the mechanical stuff,"" Munro said. ""There are hundreds of us in the field that could help them fix that. I hope they pick one.""

Premarket moves do not always carry over into regular trade.Chip stocks gathered for a sharp early advance, with all 30 of the Philly Chip Index stocks trading flat to higher. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) led, up 10% in premarket trade. The chipmaker reported significant acceleration in earnings and revenue growth in its first-quarter results late Wednesday, and guidance pointed to further acceleration ahead. The stock has been consolidating for nine months, and has fallen below crucial levels of technical support.Among the other chip names in premarket motion, Xilinx (XLNX) jumped 5%, InterDigital (IDCC) rose 3.3% and Micron Technology rose 2.9%. Micron is looking to retake a cup base buy point at 49.99. It pulled back to nearly 8% below that entry, stopping just short of an absolute trigger of the automatic sell rule.Chipotle Mexican Grill rocketed 13.8% higher following stronger-than-expected first-quarter results, leading the S&P 500 in premarket trading. That positioned the stock for a potential breakout early Thursday. The stock ended Wednesday session just below a 330.24 buy point in a bottoming base, but shares remain deep in a year-long consolidation and should be approached with added caution.O'Reilly Automotive ran a hot second among S&P 500 stock futures, up 12% in premarket trading. Its first-quarter sales and profit narrowly beat analyst targets. The stock finished Wednesday's session 18% below its January high.Domino's Pizza spun up a 5.8% premarket advance. A 59% earnings gain and a 26% improvement in revenue trounced analyst estimates. Shares ended Wednesday trades 1% below a 236.10 buy point in a flat base.IBD 50 name TAL Education popped 5.2% in premarket trading. The China-based chain of after school tutoring centers blew past analyst expectations with a 75% earnings gain and a 59% rise in revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter. The premarket move positioned shares to open back above a 36.26 buy point, but the stock comes with a long list of cautions. Among the most important, the base is very late stage, and the stock had pulled back more than 8% below the base's entry, tripping the automatic sell rule.On the downside, airline stocks were under early pressure. American Airlines (AAL) narrowed its early loss to 2.9% as lowered full-year earnings guidance diluted strong unit revenue growth and a narrow earnings beat for the first quarter.  Southwest Airlines (LUV) dumped 3.8% following mixed first-quarter results. The mood spilled over onto Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL), but both had trimmed early losses to a bit more than 1% apiece.Treasury yields and oil prices could have some impact on how durable early gains might be across the span of Thursday's session. Early trade Thursday showed bonds rising a bit off Wednesday's settle price, sending the 10-year yield down 4 basis points to 2.99%. Crude oil prices climbed another 0.8%, putting U.S. benchmark crude near $69 a barrel and within 2% of last Thursday's 41-month high.March durable goods orders increased 2.6%, the Commerce Department said, down from February's 3.5% surge, but still well above the 1.7% gain expected by economists. Transportation powered the beat. Core orders, minus transportation were down 0.1% for the month, and below forecasts for a 0.6% increase.First-time unemployment claims slowed to 209,000 in the week ended April 21, the Labor Department estimated. That was down from an already low 233,000 claims in the prior week, falling to what was reportedly the lowest level in 48 years, and undercutting economist views for a slight decrease to 230,000 new filings.RELATED:Nasdaq Jumps As Facebook, PayPal Climb; This Retailer Poised For Gap Up Open Dow Outperforms Thanks To Boeing; Nasdaq Recovers But Growth Stocks Hit HardApple Faces 'Gloom and Doom' Ahead Of EarningsWhy Winning Stocks Are Strong Price Performers Before Big Price MovesBitcoin, Other Cryptocurrencies Slide After Wall Provider HackedThese 4 Apparel Stocks Look Fashionable As They Outperform Market

A trio of big merger deals are making headlines, including a long-mooted combination of Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), which reports earnings Tuesday, is still the world's most valuable company but has been decidedly mediocre for a full 12 months.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fell last week, though they pared losses after finding support near their 200-day moving averages.

And now higher oil prices, which once again rose to their highest level since 2014 on Tuesday, could add to upward pressure on prices.At a minimum, the risk of another inflation undershoot has diminished. All the near-term risk is to the upside. That, in turn, could dampen demand for U.S. debt at a time when deficits are beginning to spiral higher and the Fed is curtailing its own holdings of Treasury and mortgage debt.In a Tuesday note, Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist, projected that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, looks likely to rise to 2.3% by the end of 2019, up from 1.6% in February.Core PCE inflation for March will be reported on Monday, April 30.The Federal Reserve will meet on May 1-2 but isn't expected to hike rates again until the June meeting.

1279,KEY,"U.S. manufacturing expanded last month at the slowest pace since July, while prices paid for materials continued to accelerate amid supply constraints and tariff concerns, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed Tuesday.XThe results included signs that factories are having trouble keeping up with demand. A measure of order backlogs was the highest in almost 14 years, and delivery times lengthened to match the second-longest since March 2010. The gauges for new orders and production weakened for a fourth straight month.Even with the April decline, the main index is close to the 57.9 average since January 2017 and is consistent with solid-but- moderating activity. Trump administration policies have created both tailwinds and headwinds for manufacturers: Tax cuts are expected to underpin demand, while materials costs are accelerating, partly from supply-chain disruptions stemming from tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Energy costs are also on the rise, with oil reaching a three-year high last month.Economists taking note of the softer ISM factory payrolls index may nonetheless wait for its services counterpart before tweaking forecasts for April employment.

1287,KEY,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Stamps.com (STMP) are innovative U.S. companies, in very different businesses, and at very different stages in their development.So, how are their stock charts similar? Both are offering investors buy opportunities in the ramp up to their earnings reports.Weighing in with a market capitalization of nearly $108 billion, Adobe is a serious large cap player. Now a 36-year-old company, Adobe is the originator of PDF files and the related Acrobat software. Its Photoshop image-editing software is a household name. And its Adobe Creative Suite programs are a publishing industry staple.Over the last several years, the San Jose, Calif.-based outfit has transitioned from a provider of desktop software applications to a cloud-based, software-as-a-service model. Adobe's updated Creative Suite, dubbed Adobe Creative Cloud, has been a centerpiece of this transition.Analyst consensus expects the company to report a strong 51% EPS gain when it delivers its first quarter results on June 14. That is about even with the average gain over the past three quarters. Sales growth is projected at 22%, just below the three-quarter average.Adobe stock price took a dip Tuesday in mildly lighter than average trade, dropping for another test of its 10-week moving average after breaking out from a flat base in January. The stock is up about 17% since that breakout at 186.37. A series of tight weekly closes, just above support at the stock's 10-week moving average, are a good sign. These suggest institutional investors are holding steady ahead of earnings.Adobe has rebounded off support at its 10-week line twice since its January breakout. That makes the current rebound a bit more risky, but still actionable. The stock should only dip nominally below the line, if at all, before a rebound. The higher the volume on the bounce, the better. The buy range is the same as with any buy point: 5% above where the stock price touches the line.For its part, Stamps.com has a market capitalization of less than $4 billion. That puts it near the low end of the midcap spectrum.Headquartered in El Segundo, Calif., the company introduced internet-based postage to the market under the name StampMaster in 1996. It went public under the stamps.com name in 1999 and turned profitable on an annual basis in 2005.Since 2010, the company has increased sales and earnings every year. But the first quarter may mark an inflection point. Analyst consensus expects a mere 4% gain in EPS, while revenue growth is projected to slow to 17%. That would be the company's weakest performance in both categories in 15 quarters.For the year, consensus views see Stamps.com earnings down 19%. Meanwhile, sales are expected to grow a healthy 37%.The first-quarter earnings view sets a low bar. If Stamps.com were to top that target, investors may or may not drive shares higher. Some may be looking for an exit ahead of slowing earnings. At the same time, Stamps.com has itself been discussed as an attractive acquisition target for Amazon.com (AMZN).In any case, the stock is hovering just above a 215.86 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. It is still about 6% below its October high. That could present some mild overhead supply issues as investors who bought during the stock's big August gap-up look for a point of exit.But Stamps.com's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a healthy B. Its Up/Down Volume Ratio is also in good standing, at 1.2. This suggests institutional investors are in buying mode. And the stock's relative strength line has been trending higher since December, reinforcing a possible breakout.RELATED:Adobe Systems Seen Bumping Heads With Salesforce.comAdobe Launches Ad Network As Stock Faces A Key TestStocks With Rising Relative Price Strength: Stamps.com

1288,KEY,"General Motors (GM), Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) rallied after a report that President Trump dropped a controversial proposal that vehicles made in Canada and Mexico for the U.S. market must contain at least 50% American materials.XCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday he continues to be optimistic on Nafta talks as a deal on autos appeared to be closer, according to several reports.The Trump administration backed off its demand on auto content — which Canada and Mexico had rejected — during negotiations to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement in Washington last week, Reuters said, citing Canada's The Globe and Mail.Other reports tempered that stance, with sources telling Bloomberg that while the U.S. has shown some flexibility on the 50% quota, it hasn't formally withdrawn the demand.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCanada's ambassador to the U.S. told reporters Tuesday that the U.S. has made ""quite creative"" suggestions that eventually could make the quota unnecessary, according to Bloomberg.In addition to the 50% quota, U.S. officials also had sought to raise the amount of Nafta content in autos sold here to 85% from 62.5%.Quotas for U.S. content in cars, trucks and SUVs are a sticking point for continental trade partners, as well as auto companies like GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, which have built up Canada and Mexico as critical manufacturing and supply-chain hubs.The auto industry was relieved when the Trump administration granted exemptions for Canada and Mexico under the new steel and aluminum tariffs.Shares of GM climbed 2.6% on the stock market today, Ford gained 1.6%, and Fiat Chrysler advanced 2.4%. Kansas City Southern (KSU), which carries freight between the U.S. and Mexico, rose 2.9%.Auto-parts makers posted the strongest gains in days, with Magna International (MGA) jumping 3.5% Wednesday, Lear Corporation (LEA) bounding 2.1% higher and Delphi Technologies (DLPH) advancing 1.5%.The reports come as presidential elections loom in neighboring Mexico, raising fears of political headwinds as the July vote nears.GM declined to comment, describing the media reports as ""speculation."" But, it said, a withdrawal from Nafta would have broad negative implications for the U.S. economy and auto industry.""The agreement is vital to the success of the auto industry and we support efforts to modernize it in a way that is good for the industry as a whole and the U.S. economy,"" a GM spokesperson said.The American Automotive Policy Council, which works on trade issues for member companies General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from IBD.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:No. 1-Ranked IPO Stock Breaks Out, Expects Big Q1 Earnings GrowthThese 5 Top Stocks Stood Out MondayThese 3 China Nets Are Flashing This Bullish Signal; This 1 Has Earnings Due'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The Works

1289,KEY,"Motivated by a goal to create meaning in his work, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) CEO Mike Mussallem pushed boundaries to follow his passion for helping people live their best lives.In the process, Mussallem and his team have transformed Edwards into the global leader in patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease, as well as critical care and surgical monitoring.Mussallem believes the key to a leader's success is finding meaning in work.""When I talk to folks that are developing leaders, I strongly encourage people to find meaning in their work because it allows you to be your best and might even surprise you in terms of how much impact you can have,"" Mussallem told IBD.For Mussallem, the meaning in his work is ""to impact individual patients with life-changing and lifesaving technologies.""Such thinking has been the driving force behind Edwards' ""patient first"" culture and innovation strategy. And it's led to Edwards' introduction of lifesaving and life-sustaining therapies such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), rapid-deployment surgical heart valve replacement and noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring.But it took Mussallem some soul searching to identify his true calling.""Early on I worked to try to pull myself up; I helped to pay for my education by working in the steel mills,"" he said. ""At that time in my younger years, I was probably more focused on how big my paycheck was and how good the benefits were. It probably wasn't until I joined health care in 1979 that I started thinking about doing something that really mattered to people's lives.""Mussallem's leadership role at Edwards traces back to his career at Baxter International (BAX), where he started working in 1979. He held a number of posts there, including group vice president of its cardiovascular division from 1994 to 2000.Mussallem was part of a group at Baxter that in the 1990s proposed the cardiovascular division could innovate faster and better serve patients if it spun out as an independent company. That happened on April 3, 2000, when Edwards Lifesciences was established and began life as a public company. Mussallem is the first and only chairman and CEO Edwards has had as a stand-alone company.Thanks to ongoing innovation, guided by Mussallem's passion for helping improve and save patients' lives, Edwards' position in the medical technology industry has skyrocketed. Edwards is the leader in surgical and transcatheter heart valves, says Glenn Novarro, an analyst and managing director at RBC Capital Markets.The reasons: ""They have the best technology, and they invest the most of any med tech company in heart valves,"" Novarro told IBD. ""And they're always first to market.""Edwards and his team have propelled impressive financial growth and gained the attention of investors.In each of the last 10 years, Edwards' top line has grown more than 10%. Its stock price has gone from 3.438 (split-adjusted) at its IPO on April 3, 2000, to 136.67 on April 3, 2018, a gain of 3,875.3%.""I learned a lot over the years by doing,"" he said. ""More and more I found that having a great culture is what first and foremost underpins the success of the company, especially when the culture drives the real purpose of the company. I feel like it's the driver of a lot of our success, and it gives me great comfort that we are all aligned.""Edwards' culture is grounded in a patient focus, says Mussallem. Edwards has an opportunity to be close to patients. Each one of its heart valves has a unique serial number that Edwards can trace back to the people who handmade and inspected the valve. Edwards often has reunions for the patients and the teams who made their individual valves.""You can imagine what that does for our team,"" he said. ""It reinforces the importance of people's work.""Adds Novarro: ""This is his passion. He puts everything into this company. That's why he is a great leader. Most successful CEOs are passionate. Mike takes it to another level. It's not just Edwards that is his passion. What Edwards does for patients (also) is his passion.""Mussallem says the company doesn't try to solve every health care problem. ""We stay very focused on structural heart disease and critical care medicine. We feel like these patients could be better served than they are today, and there are big opportunities to apply technology to improve their care.""We like to focus on bold innovations, literally breakthrough technologies that are transformative to existing care. And when we get that right, we can add a lot of value for patients.""For Edwards, the big groundbreaker has been its pioneering efforts to bring transcatheter aortic valve replacement to market, which in turn, has led to a major transformation of the company.""It's abundantly clear that in the 18 years that Edwards has been a public company, Mike not only has thoughtfully reshaped the company's post spinoff portfolio by divesting and acquiring, but also has clearly demonstrated visionary insight about how and where to innovate — brilliantly — in the complex medical device space with the company's TAVR/structural heart initiatives."" Rick Wise, senior medical technology analyst and a managing director at Stifel, told IBD.Mussallem saw a big opportunity with TAVR, despite the fact it might cannibalize the company's existing leading products.""We were, and continue to be, the leader in surgical heart valves, and TAVR was such a radical idea and most of our customers would discourage us,"" said Mussallem. ""The rationale was that if someone was going to disrupt our core business, my feeling was that it must be us. We had to be the ones. No one else could pursue this radical idea.""We worked very hard to develop this therapy. It was not simple or linear. But we persisted because the promise for patients was so powerful. It was the first time in my career I had a chance to experience in a significant way what I call a triple win — improve mortality, improve the quality of life for patients and improve economics for the health care system.""The Edwards SAPIEN family of transcatheter aortic heart valves and their delivery systems are used to treat heart valve disease using catheter-based approaches for certain patients for whom traditional open-heart surgery isn't optimal, the company says. Delivered while the heart is beating, these valves can enable patients to have a better quality of life sooner than those receiving traditional surgical therapies.To motivate and guide employees, Mussallem and his team have developed a ""secret sauce,"" of principles. With an eye always on patient needs, Mussallem encourages his team to dream big, not be afraid of failure and learn from mistakes.Mussallem developed his leadership and management principles from many sources. While at Baxter, Mussallem gained confidence in his skills.""One of the lessons I learned was not to be afraid of difficult jobs,"" he said. ""Often if a job is not high profile or involves taking over an underperforming business or function, it isn't seen as glamorous. But it is an opportunity for someone to get significant responsibility and demonstrate their own ability to add value.""That lesson helped Mussallem support the decision to spin off as an independent company the cardiovascular division of Baxter, for which Mussallem was responsible. At the time, the cardiovascular business was the poorest performer in the Baxter portfolio, he says. It had a low growth rate, low profitability and an uncertain future.""We had a lot of hard work to do in those early years,"" he said. ""But the team stayed optimistic. And over time we were able to sharpen our strategy and seriously invest in new innovation. We were able to completely change the profile of the company.""Another element of the strategy that has been a priority is leadership.""We feel like we should try and be the best in what we do,"" he adds. ""I'm proud that over 98% of what Edwards sells is in the No. 1 global position.""Mussallem, 65, was born and grew up in Gary, Ind. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 1974.After graduation, he worked at Union Carbide as a chemical engineer making Prestone antifreeze. But over time he realized he could be doing something more fulfilling — changing people's lives — and then went into health care.He developed many of his personal values and passion for innovation in his younger years.""I've never been one to be afraid to take on a challenge,"" he said. ""I was fortunate to have loving parents who, like others, lived their life to give their children a better life. I always felt a responsibility to do my best. I believe our company has many of those same ideas.""Transformed Edwards into the global leader and innovator for structural heart diseaseOvercame: Risky business decision to spin off Edwards from Baxter to develop complex therapies.Lesson: Find meaning in your work ""because it allows you to be your best and might even surprise you in terms of how much impact you can have.""

1291,KEY,"U.S. manufacturing expanded last month at the slowest pace since July, while prices paid for materials continued to accelerate amid supply constraints and tariff concerns, data from the Institute for Supply Management showed Tuesday.XThe results included signs that factories are having trouble keeping up with demand. A measure of order backlogs was the highest in almost 14 years, and delivery times lengthened to match the second-longest since March 2010. The gauges for new orders and production weakened for a fourth straight month.Even with the April decline, the main index is close to the 57.9 average since January 2017 and is consistent with solid-but- moderating activity. Trump administration policies have created both tailwinds and headwinds for manufacturers: Tax cuts are expected to underpin demand, while materials costs are accelerating, partly from supply-chain disruptions stemming from tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Energy costs are also on the rise, with oil reaching a three-year high last month.Economists taking note of the softer ISM factory payrolls index may nonetheless wait for its services counterpart before tweaking forecasts for April employment.

1296,KEY,"IBD's New Highs List can provide individual investors with a pool of buy candidates. Stocks often reach a new high as they break out of a consolidation.There's another way, though, to use the new highs/new lows data. Treat it as a secondary stock market indicator. Sometimes it can serve as a kind of a canary in the coal mine, either foretelling or confirming a correction.""Sometimes"" is the keyword here. Secondary indicators are called secondary because they don't always work.Let's look at several stock-market uptrends that ran for 50 or more consecutive sessions.September to October 2010: The market was in an uptrend. New highs were running sometimes as high as 350 and never dipping under 100 for more than two consecutive sessions.But Nov. 16, the indexes delivered fewer than 100 combined new highs (NYSE plus Nasdaq) a third day in a row. This had not happened during the entire 51-session run. The Market Pulse shifted to correction.The new-highs tally had signaled a change in character.December 2011 to February 2012: An uptrend that was confirmed Dec. 20, 2011, ran for 67 sessions. But the new highs/new lows data wasn't particularly useful. The new highs tally stayed fairly low throughout the rally.If the canary doesn't normally chirp much, it's hard to spot the change in character.July to September 2012: The uptrend confirmed July 26, 2012, ran for 52 days. Once again, the new-high tally was too restrained to be useful.December 2016 to February 2017: The uptrend confirmed Dec. 7, 2016, lasted 70 days. This rally had many days of huge new-high tallies and strayed into two digits only on isolated occasions. Yet, the new highs tally wasn't useful in the canary role. There were times the market came under pressure, but the situation never degraded into a correction.August 2017 to February 2018: On Aug. 22, 2017, a new uptrend was confirmed. The run lasted 112 sessions. The new-highs tally was in three digits throughout the run, dropping to two digits never more than two days in a row.That changed beginning Feb. 2, when new highs in two digits became common. On Feb. 8, the fifth consecutive session in two digits, the Market Pulse changed to correction.The key is to pay attention to new highs. Sometimes they will signal a change in character.RELATED:Is Apple's Stock, Or The Entire Stock Market, A Random Walk?Winning Is No Reason To Call A Stock's Run Done3 Factors That Can Reveal Much About A CompanyStocks Near A Buy ZoneHow To Find Top Large Cap Stocks: Inside Big Cap 20

1302,KEY,"HOUSTON — A version of Russia's Soyuz capsule has been flying since the 1960s, but Boeing (BA) and SpaceX are developing new capsules that will offer astronauts improvements when they travel to and from the International Space Station.XSince the space shuttle program ended in 2011, American astronauts have had to hitch rides on Russian spacecraft while NASA develops a U.S.-made alternative. In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing a $4.2 billion contract and SpaceX a $2.6 billion contract to develop ""space taxis"" for service to the ISS.While NASA spokesman Dan Huot said the venerable Soyuz is ""extremely efficient"" at getting to and from low earth orbit, that doesn't mean it's a comfortable ride.""All the astronauts will tell you, when you're coming home, it kind of feels like a bit of a car crash,"" he said in an interview at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space CenterGet these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThat's despite the efforts the Russians make to soften the blow. The Soyuz has enough space for three crew members at a time, and astronauts are fitted with a seat liner specifically molded to their bodies to help protect them when the capsule lands in Kazakhstan.Four parachutes are deployed 15 minutes before landing, and six engines fire just seconds before touching down to slow the Soyuz down further.Boeing's Crew Space Transportation-100 Starliner is aiming for a softer landing. The capsule can fit up to seven people and can be reused up to 10 times, with a six month turn-around time.And Starliner landings will carry less than half the jolt of the Soyuz, Boeing spokesman Steven Siceloff said, as parachutes and an airbag will be employed.""It's not quite like falling onto a mattress — but not far from it,"" he said.Meanwhile, SpaceX, started by Tesla (TSLA) founder Elon Musk, scrapped plans for a powered landing that would use engines to lower its Dragon capsule gently on landing legs, a technique the company's current Falcon 9 first-stage boosters use when they return to earth.""It would have taken a tremendous amount of effort to qualify that for safety"" with NASA, Musk said at the ISS R&D Conference last year.So the Dragon capsule will land via parachutes at first until SpaceX can transition to a new system.Boeing plans to test an uncrewed capsule in August, and its crewed test is scheduled for November, but the company reportedly has warned the crewed test could be pushed back to 2019.SpaceX has pushed back an uncrewed test flight to this August from April, with a crewed mission set for December instead of August.Contracting with a U.S. provider is also expected to save U.S. taxpayers money. At two launches per year, NASA estimates each seat will cost $54 million vs. the $81.8 million per seat the U.S. paid Russia in 2015.Boeing shares lost 18 cents to 329.80 on the stock market today, tumbling 7% for the week, crashing through the 50-day line in heavy volume.

Shoe sales grew only 1%, while clothing revenue rose 7%.While management did not tweak full-year guidance for 14 to 19 cents in adjusted EPS and low-single-digit net revenue growth, execs on the call said they expect a 9- to 10-cent loss in the current quarter, well below current consensus for losses of 6 cents.Shares of Under Armour reversed sharply to finish 1.5% higher at 18.03 on the stock market today, paring some losses and finding support at their 50-day average.

1305,KEY,"S&P 500 futures tilted slightly lower Tuesday morning after the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones once again hit resistance at the 50-day moving average on Monday.Apple (AAPL), the largest weight in all three indexes, is struggling with its 200-day line ahead of its key earnings report late Tuesday. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell back below its 200-day as Intel (INTC) extended Friday's negative reversal and Micron Technology (MU) undercut recent lows. Meanwhile, the Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling Fed recession risks as policymakers get set for a two-day meeting.For a second straight session, the major averages attempted to reclaim the 50-day line near the open only to quickly pull back. The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have only finished above that key support or resistance level in a handful of  sessions since Feb. 2, when the stock market correction was underway. The Nasdaq has only closed above its 50-day on three sessions since March 21.S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures lost 0.15%. Nasdaq futures slid 0.2%.

Privacy Policy & Terms of Use Apple rose 1.8% to 165.26 on the stock market today. But the iPhone maker closed below its 200-day moving average after hitting 167.26 intraday. The Dow Jones component has not been a stock market leader for quite some time. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been slumping since early November. Apple's RS line is about even to where it was a full year ago.Analysts expect earnings of $2.69 a share in the March quarter, up 29% vs. a year earlier, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue should swell 15.5% to $61.1 billion. That would be the best EPS gain in 10 quarters and the seventh straight quarter of gradually accelerating sales growth. But that's largely due to the still-new iPhone X product cycle. The fear, backed by warnings from several Apple suppliers, is that iPhone demand is rapidly falling.Wall Street sees the company selling 53 million iPhone units in the latest quarter, but just 42 million in the current quarter. Analysts expect Apple to sharply boost share buybacks and dividends with repatriated foreign profits. But those capital returns may be priced into the stock already.The Philly Sox Index fell 1.1% on Monday, back below its 200-day moving average. Before last week, the chip index hadn't undercut its 200-day since June 2016. Intel fell 2.1% on Monday. On Friday, the Dow Jones stock shot up 5.2% soon after the open following late-Thursday earnings, but closed down 0.6%. Micron Technology slid 3.3% to an eight-week low. On Friday, Micron reversed from a 50-day line test and plunged 5.2%.It's hard for the stock market to rally if chips aren't taking part. Chips are a huge share of the major averages, especially the Nasdaq. And because semiconductors are in so many products, if chip stocks are struggling that can be a bad sign for a whole slew of end products. Apple's recent sell-off has come amid a series of chip warnings, with Apple suppliers Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) among those citing weak smartphone demand.The 10-year Treasury yield alarmed investors by topping 3% last week, rising as high as 3.02% before ending the week around 2.96%.

He expects the conglomerate's largest Q1 profit declines will come from the power and transportation businesses. He also sees GE's planned accounting restatement adding pressure to ""this 'show me' stock.""GE's $1.00-1.07 adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 excludes $3.2 billion of pension and $2.5 billion of restructuring expenses, a 55-cent ""hit"" to GAAP EPS, Khanna said.

So Khanna finds GE's GAAP earnings base and free cash flow to be closer to less than 50 cents a share.He warned: ""This lower, truer EPS base partly explains why we don't believe the $0.48/year dividend is safe unless 'contract assets' convert to cash on a net basis, and/or the power market rebounds sharply and soon.""GE's so-called contract assets reflect revenues that GE books on long-term equipment and service contracts before it gets the cash in hand.

1308,KEY,"As Fed policymakers began a two-day meeting on Tuesday, the two-year Treasury yield touched its highest level since 2008 and the dollar rose to its highest point all year.XWith fears of a trade war receding, the dollar has surged over the past month. The greenback also has gotten a boost as inflation picks up and expectations grow that the Fed will hike rates four times this year. Meanwhile, central banks in Europe and Japan are in no rush to tighten, so further dollar gains are a fair bet.Those three trends — higher interest rates, inflation and the dollar — could squeeze earnings in the second quarter and beyond.

The toy maker said the drop was a result of the Toys R Us liquidation, as well as ""uncertainty"" in some operations and excess inventory in Europe.""We are working to put the near-term disruption from Toys R Us behind us,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner said in a statement.The retailer, one of Hasbro's largest customers, filed for bankruptcy in September, had a terrible fourth quarter and then announced the liquidation of several divisions, including the U.S. This has presented another hurdle for toymakers that were already dealing with slowing growth and concerns that the success of making so many products based off an ever-growing slate of kids entertainment is waning.The Toys R Us effect could be clearly seen in Hasbro's results. In North America, sales sank 19%. Revenue dropped even more in Europe with a decline of 28%. The liquidation also generated expenses of $61.4 million.The world's largest publicly traded toy maker, based in Pawtucket, R.I., lost $112.5 million in the quarter, versus a profit of $68.6 million a year earlier.

1313,KEY,"In early March 2018, Congressional hearings began on the Trump Administration's ""Framework for Rebuilding Infrastructure in America.""While the President's proposals will be debated vigorously, and the approach that will finally emerge from such debate is uncertain, one fact is not in dispute: the nation's infrastructure is in dire need of investment. Our transit, water, electric power and other systems, many of which date back to the middle of the last century, are long overdue for renewal or upgrading.The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave America's infrastructure a D+ on its quadrennial ""Report Card"" last year.As a practical matter, the federal government will not be able to shoulder the entire burden of funding our nation's infrastructure revitalization effort. ASCE has estimated that the country would need to spend nearly $4.6 trillion on infrastructure from 2016 to 2025, but also cites a gap of almost $2.1 trillion between the overall need and estimated funding.A key part of the solution, according to ASCE, is to, ""…create incentives for state and local governments and the private sector to invest in maintenance, and to improve the efficiency and performance of existing infrastructure.""Fortunately, a number of states and localities are taking matters into their own hands, demonstrating strong leadership in recognizing the need — and assembling the requisite financing — for vital infrastructure projects.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA few of the major projects that are now underway around the country include: the California High-Speed Rail between San Francisco and L.A. ($68 billion), New York City's Second Avenue Subway ($10.5 billion), the Light Rail Expansion in Charlotte, NC ($1.2 billion), and the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement in New York State ($3.98 billion).While federal dollars do make up portions of the funding for these projects, state, local and private sources, as well as toll-fees, are significant contributors.It appears that the above-mentioned projects, among many others, are at the forefront of a movement toward greater local investment in infrastructure.The administration's proposal has sought to advance this trend, calling for  $200 billion in federal funding to stimulate an estimated $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investment. The intention is to use federal dollars as seed money to incentivize infrastructure investment, while moving more than 80% of the financing burden to the state and local levels.Testifying before Congress, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao conveyed the Administration's view that, ""States and localities are best equipped to understand the infrastructure investments needs of their communities. The infrastructure incentives program… would encourage increased state, local, and private investment in infrastructure. This program would provide for targeted Federal investments, encourage innovation, streamline project delivery, and help transform the way infrastructure is designed, built, and maintained.""Regardless of where one stands with respect to the administration's ""seed money"" approach, it seems clear that state and local governments are not waiting for lawmakers in Washington to arrive at a funding solution.Los Angeles passed a $120 billion infrastructure plan back in November 2016, funded entirely by a sales tax increase, as many local voters realized how desperately they need to invest in infrastructure.Many other states have taken the initiative to increase their own pools of infrastructure funding. For example, 17 states and the District of Columbia have raised their gasoline taxes in the past three years, and at least nine states, from Alaska to South Carolina, may be considering similar moves in the near future.Those state and local governments that want to support infrastructure development without depending on federal resources could consider several other options, including but not limited to:While a major spending program from Washington would be a welcome boost for infrastructure investment, state and local governments increasingly are taking the initiative to secure infrastructure funding independent of the federal budget.These government bodies are demonstrating their resolve — and developing the financial resources — to revitalize aging systems and create 21st century infrastructure to support future economic growth and more livable communities.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

She raised her expectations for Keytruda by $2 billion in 2021 and by $4 billion in 2025.Also late Monday, European regulators accepted Merck's application of its combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy in untreated lung cancer patients. The decision was made based on the results of a study presented last week called Keynote-189, Merck said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, shares of the Dow Jones component climbed 2.4% to close at 60.25. Earlier, the stock touched its highest point since late January. Meanwhile, rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) dipped 0.5% to finish at 50.90.The hoopla surrounding Merck follows the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting last week. Then, a regimen of Merck's Keytruda and chemotherapy seemingly topped a combination of Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy as first treatments in lung cancer.Keytruda plus chemo reduced the risk of death by 51%, Merck said. A combination of Opdivo and Yervoy cut the risk of cancer progression or death by 42% in a similar group of patients compared with chemotherapy alone, Bristol said.Now, analysts expect Merck to take the lion's share of an already large lung cancer market. Keytruda and the animal health unit drive Merck's value, Rubin said. She sees the bottom line getting a disproportionate contribution from higher Keytruda sales.Rubin assumes Merck will eventually have roughly half of the immuno-oncology market, up from her earlier estimate for 40%. Immuno-oncology medicines treat cancer by teaching the immune system to identify tumor cells.In 2021, Keytruda will bring in $12 billion with $8 billion of that stemming from sales as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer, she predicted. Rubin expects Keytruda to generate $16 billion by 2025.As a lone therapy, Keytruda will likely get a quarter of the market serving patients whose tumors have a lot of the PD-L1 protein, Rubin said. The amount of PD-L1 is thought to predict how well drugs like Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo will work. She doesn't expect Bristol's Opdivo to get any of this market.Merck's share of the combination market remains to be determined, she said. Keytruda likely has access to 70% of the lung cancer market. But Bristol and Roche (RHHBY) are still running tests of their rival combinations.""While there is room for further upside if Merck establishes more of a leadership position, we still need to see data from other combination trials to give them more credit,"" she said.Merck could also seek mergers to further diversify, especially as diabetes drug Januvia looks likely to see generic competition in the mid-2020s, Rubin said.""We see potential for Merck to be an even better story if management takes steps to diversify and address longer term growth post-Januvia to complement Keytruda,"" she said. ""And we believe they have more than enough balance sheet firepower to do so.""The firm is now a ""compelling mix and margin improvement story,"" she said. That's mostly been overlooked amid the lung cancer discussion. But, historically, investors reward margin expansions stories. Key examples include AbbVie (ABBV) and Eli Lilly (LLY).RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

1315,KEY,"A softening Trump administration stance on sanctions imposed against Russian aluminum giant Rusal just killed last week's breakout by Alcoa (AA).Aluminum prices plunged as much as 10% early Monday on word that President Trump's administration will ease its sanctions regime and may hold Rusal harmless if Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska divests his stake. Other metals prices and crude oil also retreated somewhat.Shares of Alcoa slumped 13.5% to 51.91 on the stock market today, while Century Aluminum (CENX) fell 5.3%.Prices for alumina and aluminum have surged since the U.S. enacted sanctions that Congress ordered for Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Rio Tinto (RIO) said it could no longer fulfill supply contracts for alumina sourced from joint operations with Rusal in Australia and Ireland because of the U.S. sanctions. Rio Tinto lost 1.9% Monday. BHP Billiton (BHP), another global mining giant, retreated 0.9%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""Rusal has approached us to petition for delisting. Given the impact on our partners and allies, we are issuing a general license extending the maintenance and wind-down period while we consider Rusal's petition.""The stocks surged last week, especially Alcoa, as prices of alumina, a key ingredient in aluminum, hit a record high and aluminum prices rose to a six-year high.Alcoa on Wednesday raised its 2018 EBITDA guidance to a range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion vs. the $2.6 billion-$2.8 billion range given in January, citing tariffs, sanctions and market conditions. The company forecast a supply deficit for both alumina and aluminum.Alcoa shares surged above a buy point at 57.60 on Wednesday. The stock rose as high as 62 on Thursday, but fell to as low as 51.50 intraday Monday.Alcoa had more to gain and lose from the Russia sanctions because it supplies alumina and bauxite, as well as finished aluminum. In the long run, that exposure to all the commodities involved in aluminum production is a positive, Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry said in a Monday note hiking Alcoa's price target to 70 from 60, apparently just ahead of the Rusal news.While Rusal sanctions lit a fire under Alcoa shares, supply reforms in China look to be a long-term driver, BMO Capital analyst David Gagliano said last week while hiking his price target to 80.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Market Answers 5 Big Questions This WeekThe Big Picture: Coming Week Could Turn Market AroundSalesforce, Workday Lead Five Top Software Stocks Near Buy PointsStocks To Watch: TD Ameritrade, Green Dot Among Stocks Added To IBD 50 ListLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1319,KEY,"Trey Gowdy's emotions sometimes bubble disconcertingly close to the surface, but unlike many members of the political class, he is not all surface.At a breakfast four years ago, the South Carolina Republican had tears in his eyes as he explained when he would leave Congress: after Tim Scott, a Republican congressman who had been appointed to the Senate in 2013 when Jim DeMint resigned, had been elected in his own right. This, Gowdy said at that breakfast, would close the circle of his state's history.Scott, an African-American, was born in 1965, 44 days after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson. The 1960 census had recorded South Carolina as 34.8% African-American. It was only about 27% African-American when Scott was elected in 2014 to complete DeMint's unfinished term, and was elected to a full term in 2016.So, at the end of 2018, Gowdy, after eight years representing northern South Carolina's booming Greenville-Spartanburg area, will put Washington in his rearview mirror. The nation's capital will be duller because of the departure of him and his myriad hairstyles. He will not miss it but will miss his weekly dinners with Scott, almost always at the same table in the Capitol Hill Club, a Republican hangout.A former prosecutor, Gowdy ran for Congress in part to get a respite from things that prosecutors must stare at unblinkingly. There was the 9-year old girl with cerebral palsy who was beaten to death by her mother's boyfriend. Gowdy's eyes are moist as he says that the girl's picture is on his desk in his congressional office. Staring down such evils is, he says, particularly arduous for someone like him, because ""if you've got no faith, you've got nothing to lose."" He, a devout Christian, thought it was ""time to do something else.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen he first ran for public office, a friend congratulated him for being up to 20 in polls that showed him losing 80-20. When in 2010 he ran for Congress against a six-term Republican incumbent, he surfed into office on that year's tea party wave. And he was immediately ""miserable,"" until he began his friendship with Scott.As a member of three key committees (Oversight and Government Reform, Judiciary, and Intelligence), Gowdy has been at the — sometimes he has been the — epicenter of controversies. These have included Benghazi (honestly, do you remember what that was about? Didn't think so), the two parties' dueling memos about Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the Mueller investigation.When his fellow Republicans on the Intelligence Committee faulted the FBI, CIA and NSA for concluding ""with high confidence"" that Russia preferred Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, Gowdy said that the committee's own evidence showed that Russian involvement in the election was ""motivated in whole or in part by a desire to harm her candidacy or undermine her presidency had she prevailed."" Gowdy has never met Trump and might leave Washington without having done so.Politics as he envisioned it would be a vocation in which participants asked themselves: What cause do I believe in strongly enough that I am willing to lose for it? Now, Gowdy says, the dominant question is: What am willing to do to win? At 53, he says he wants to go somewhere ""where facts matter."" So, he probably will not teach in a university.South Carolina has been punching above its weight recently. Former Gov. and now U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, daughter of immigrants from India, is disproving the plausible — until she came along — rule that no one could have sustained transactions with the current president without being diminished. Former South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney is director of the Office of Management and Budget. James Clyburn, the most senior member of the state's otherwise all-Republican House delegation, is assistant minority leader, the third-ranking position in the Democrats' House leadership.It is difficult to say how, but it is also difficult to doubt that, the social soil of South Carolina has something to do with the state's success in seeding national politics with talent.Gowdy and Scott have co-authored a book (""Unified: How Our Unlikely Friendship Gives Us Hope for a Divided Country"") that is dedicated to one of Scott's grandfathers and one of Gowdy's grandmothers: ""In the segregated age in which they lived, the two never met. But two generations later, their grandsons became the best of friends.""Other columns by George Will

1321,KEY,"Swing trading can avoid a lot of stock market corrections but it doesn't make you immune. Choppy markets are especially tough to maneuver. So even if you don't make much progress, you want to make sure you don't lose your hard-fought gains. Here are some rules we used in April to keep our outperformance for the year strong.First, let's revisit how IBD's SwingTrader started the first quarter with strong outperformance vs. the S&P 500. We kept the gains of a strong January by selling on the way up and going to cash at the beginning of February (1). A follow-through day (2) on Feb. 14 and a reversal in March (3) provided opportunities for more strong gains for those two months. Again, locking in profits on the way up (4) saved us from taking a big draw down. The Nasdaq composite, by contrast, saw two 10% corrections back-to-back. As a result, we showed strong outperformance vs. the S&P 500 for the first three months of 2018.This latest rally started at the beginning of April, and making progress hasn't been easy. Even the start was suspect. The first day of the rally attempt (5) was an inside day. The previous day's high was higher and the low was lower. Inside days suggest indecision and by themselves don't provide much evidence of direction one way or another. If you can't even break free from the trading range of the previous day, what does that say about your prospects for establishing a trend?Even when the Nasdaq composite started making progress, bearish reversals (6) thwarted buys every step of the way. It seemed each buy on strength hit resistance and showed signs of failure the next day. Headlines tossed markets back and forth. Therefore, finding stocks that could withstand the gyrations was like the needle in the haystack problem.Finally, the major stock market indexes seemed to find their footing and broke above their 50-day moving averages (7). The swing trading setups also increased. The problem? The venture above the 50-day line only lasted three days. As indexes broke back below the line (8), more losses hit. The result was a low batting average in April.IBD'S TAKE: Even a low batting average can outperform the market if your wins are larger than your losses. That's what happened in March for IBD's SwingTrader. Take a free trial today. How is a swing trader to survive? The most important thing is keeping your losses small. The average loss for April was below 2%. We also kept our positions to a minimum. The highest exposure at any one time in April was two full positions and two half positions. With proper position sizing, that translates to a portfolio just over half invested. The reduced exposure wasn't an accident. Exposure should increase only as your trades prove that you are right. Hence, lack of progress leads to lack of exposure.It's reasonable to expect that you won't outperform the market every month. But you don't want to take large draw downs. That's why defense becomes critical. By keeping losses small and limiting exposure, we preserved the solid outperformance of the first three months.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Sometimes Less Is More In Trading ActivityTaking Profits Early Is A Key Tenet Of Swing TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

1326,KEY,"When building your watch list, focus on stocks with an 80 or higher RS Rating. America Movil (AMX) just cleared that benchmark with an upgrade from 77 to 81.

Over 100 years of market history reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains tend to have an RS Rating of over 80 in the early stages of their moves.Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineAmerica Movil broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 19.42 entry from a cup with handle. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to form. Also understand that the most recent pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. America Movil reported -66% earnings growth last quarter. Revenue rose 3%. America Movil holds the No. 13 rank among its peers in the Telecom Services-Foreign industry group.

Yet sometimes your investing performance just might not hit the level you desire. What can you do?Consider these five steps.IBD strongly believes that each investor do an annual review of past trades each year. Do it anytime. Do it to zap bad habits and erase serious mistakes. Now, take it a step further. Compare your best performers with the top names in IBD's top-growth screens. Check out the highfliers in Sector Leaders, IBD 50, Global Leaders and Big Cap 20.You may notice that many of the stocks making these features are ""high"" in price, and yet they still form good bases. Then, they break out in surging volume. Plus, they don't fall that much during squalls of selling in the market.Some beginning investors make the mistake of seeking ""bargains"" or thinly traded issues. Price is a barometer of investment quality.Apple (AAPL) clearly shows why ""buying low"" is a poor method. When the iPhone and iPad maker broke out in August 2003, just months after the Nasdaq finally ended its huge bear market and turned in March 2003, the stock traded near 21 bucks a share, not 21 cents.Remember, financial institutions have millions, even billions, of dollars to deploy. They want companies that can grow in the long run and attract plenty of shareholders. Never forget the I in CAN SLIM, which stands for strong institutional accumulation.So, as a rule, set a minimum share price for any stock that you buy at, say, 20 or higher. In IBD's Stocks on the Move screen, don't be surprised to see leadership-quality companies trading at 40 a share or 400 a share, yet still post big price increases in above-average turnover. This screen captures many big leaders before they break out.Such action implies large fund managers are busy accumulating shares. Their long-term buying fuels breakouts and wonderful profits for the astute individual trader.Use IBD's special timesaving tool, Stock Checkup, to compare a stock's proprietary IBD ratings — from EPS to RS, from SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) to Accumulation/Distribution — with its peers in the same group.Just like top athletes, good stock investors don't let a few misses send them hustling for the showers, feeling down and out.

1331,KEY,"Russia Investigation: We assume it was someone on Robert Mueller's Russia investigation team who leaked to the media a list of dozens of questions that he wants to ask President Trump. The only question is, why?More than four dozen questions were handed over to the New York Times that appear to be questions that Mueller delivered to Trump's lawyers to give the president an idea of what he would face.As the Times notes: ""The open-ended queries appear to be an attempt to penetrate the president's thinking, to get at the motivation behind some of his most combative Twitter posts and to examine his relationships with his family and his closest advisers. They deal chiefly with the president's high-profile firings of the FBI director and his first national security adviser, his treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and a 2016 Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton.""Whew. Quite a bit there. But please notice: Only one of the key topics mentioned involves the alleged Russian-Trump campaign collusion, which many  delusional Democrats insist denied Hillary Clinton the presidency. But that was supposedly the reason for the entire Russia investigation. What gives?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt shows pretty conclusively that the Mueller investigation, which started out as an attempt to end Russian cyber-meddling in U.S. elections, has now become a fishing expedition — one whose sole purpose seems to be to catch the biggest fish of all, Donald Trump, for doing something, anything, that a special counsel could deem a criminal offense.It also shows desperation. As Thomas Gallatin of the Patriot Post notes, ""This is now the second time the Mueller team has leaked significant information to the press."" The first was in October, when Mueller's team leaked that it would charge several individuals in the investigation with crimes.Trump was, as usual, at his sarcastic best in tweeting a response: ""So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were 'leaked' to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see ... you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice! It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!""What could Mueller and his team be up to? Obviously, they want to keep the dying embers of the investigation alive by focusing on obstruction, rather than the original and entirely spurious allegation of collusion, a crime found nowhere in U.S. law.Famed Harvard legal scholar and trial attorney Alan Dershowitz said Mueller's list looks like it was intended as a trap for the loquacious Trump.""They are really designed to let him ramble and talk, and I suspect that's the strategy of the special counsel because they know that may be President Trump's weakness,"" Dershowitz said on CNN.It's pretty clear this has been a put-up job from the very beginning, with inside operators at both the Obama Justice Department and the Obama FBI assiduously protecting Hillary Clinton from charges for her violations of U.S. law with her unsecured email server, while launching a sleazy internal investigation and counteraction against Donald Trump funded by Democratic operatives and left-wing billionaires.As we've said before, it all has the stink of a Banana Republic to it, the kind of place where the rule of law no longer matters. Venezuela on the Potomac.That could be seen in last week's revelation that the Fusion GPS investigation of Trump, largely based on the ""Trump dossier"" assembled by former British spy Christopher Steele and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, didn't end after the election. In fact, as the Daily Caller's Chuck Ross reported, ""A group of wealthy donors from New York and California have forked out $50 million to fund a Russia investigation being conducted by Christopher Steele, Fusion GPS and a former staffer for Dianne Feinstein.""That devastating bit of news came from the House Intelligence Committee's recently released report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.So what is one to make of all this? Clearly, there is a long-standing effort among the Hillary Clinton Democrats and their wealthy progressive allies to sabotage Trump's presidency and to bring a never-ending investigation of all his various affairs, both business and personal.This effort does not come from the highest motives. It is a base effort to overturn the legitimate results of a national presidential election through a nonstop media campaign coupled with continuing investigations on multiple fronts to find something with which to delegitimize Trump and eventually remove him from office. It's about power, not ideals.It is, in short, a kind of bloodless political coup, acted out in slow motion. Its intent is to disenfranchise an entire nation and to cause a permanent, irreparable political split that will lead to turmoil and perhaps even violence.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Russia Scandal: Will Devin Nunes Investigation Prove 'Deep State' Collusion By FBI, DOJ?FBI Scandal: Deep State Corruption Of FBI, Justice Was There From Very Start Of Hillary Email ProbeWhy No Investigation Into FBI, Justice Dept.

1333,KEY,"Some advisors read economic reports with great interest. They track data with an eye toward deciphering market moves and helping position clients for what's ahead.If they enjoy writing, advisors may blog about what the latest indicators might reveal about the domestic and global economy. Their comments tend to focus on a range of reports, from employment numbers to Beige Book results, that they use to assess current and future markets.Like professional economists, advisors often strive to interpret data and educate clients in plain English about the significance of certain indicators. These reports can shed light on macroeconomic trends and even offer potentially valuable trading clues.""Most clients like it when we tell them what's going on beyond the headlines,"" said Daniel Kern, chief investment officer at Boston-based TFC Financial Management. ""A lot of these numbers tell you a different story than the headlines.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor example, he notes that overall wage growth is widely reported as slowly improving. But on closer inspection, the big picture becomes more complex based on variations in different sectors.""If you look at certain segments of the economy like manufacturing, construction and technology, wages are growing,"" he said. ""And wages are slowing in other industries like retail and financial services.""Scrutinizing wage gains by industry allows advisors to draw more reliable conclusions about inflation and the labor market. It might also influence buy or sell decisions for stocks in particular sectors.Among the myriad economic indicators that vie for attention, a handful of reports dominate. Monthly numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics tally nonfarm payrolls, new jobs and the unemployment rate. Advisors know that dramatic, unexpected swings can move markets.Kern prefers to look beyond the unemployment rate — which has been 4.1% for the last six months — to consider the U-6 rate that includes unemployed and underemployed people. Factoring in discouraged workers who've quit seeking a job along with part-timers who want a full-time position gives a fuller reading of the unemployment situation.""The U-6 rate gives you a picture of how much labor slack there is in the economy,"" Kern said. ""How many people can enter the labor force or work longer hours? It shows if there's room for economic growth without triggering inflation.""Advisors also track manufacturing data to gain a better sense of the economy as a whole. One of the most popular measures is the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) produced monthly by the Institute of Supply Management, a nongovernmental group.""It gives us an overall read on whether manufacturing is in expansionary or contracting territory,"" Kern said. The result provides a gauge of economic growth.Part of the challenge that advisors face when scanning economic reports is distinguishing between leading and lagging indicators of stock prices. Some observers find that manufacturing data such as the PMI can lead the direction of stocks, while other measures such as the unemployment rate tend to lag equities.Subsequent revisions of data can add another wrinkle to the process. Gross domestic product, unemployment and other indicators are often subject to rounds of revisions in the months following their initial release, undermining their use in real time as a stock trading tool.When providing economic commentary, advisors usually emphasize that a single indicator simply adds an element to a larger mosaic. Taken collectively, these strands of data enable keen market watchers to assess the potential for economic growth — or whether inflationary pressures, consumer confidence or monetary policy will surprise the markets for better or worse.To save time and streamline their research, some advisors defer to experts who track economic indicators. They may rely on these financial gurus to highlight the most important numbers from month to month.Mitchell Kraus, a certified financial planner in Santa Monica, Calif., likes to read the Calculated Risk blog. Written by Bill McBride, the blog includes a weekly schedule of economic data releases.""He follows a bunch of indicators, and I sometimes refer clients to read it too,"" Kraus said. The blog also cites excerpts from economists and provides graphs to help readers place the most recent data in historical context.Yet Kraus cautions that economic reports, while useful, play a limited role in understanding markets and making investment decisions.""I find that clients can overfocus on indices,"" he said. ""I often get calls from clients who say they've read online that a certain indicator signals a buying opportunity. But you can't time the markets"" or read too much into a single data point.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Advisors Promote Health And Wellness To Help Clients Live BetterHow Advisors Turn Clients' Tax Anxiety Into Smart PlanningAdvisors Learn Lasting Lessons From Their Favorite Business Books

1334,KEY,"From A to Z — Adobe Systems (ADBE) to Zoetis (ZTS) — $17.8 billion MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) has the sort of leading stocks that lift the portfolio into the ranks of top mutual funds.Additional top stocks like Netflix (NFLX), Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are also big reasons why the fund is in a groove, outperforming the broad market as well as its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. over short, intermediate and long periods, ranging from year-to-date to one, three, five and 10 years.So far this year, going into Wednesday, the fund was up 8.22% vs. 5.27% for its direct rivals and 1.79% for the big-cap bogey. Netflix was up 75% this year. Adobe advanced 32%. Amazon was up 29%. Lululemon had gained 20%, while Zoetis climbed 19%. Netflix, Lululemon and Amazon happen to be members of Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, for one, is a former stock on IBD's SwingTrader, an exclusive IBD feature that helps you take advantage of short-term trends by applying the rules of IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System in a swing-trading environment. Details on past trades are accessible to SwingTrade subscribers and trialists. Free trials are available.Paul Gordon, who manages the fund along with Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel, says the fund uses a classic investment strategy. ""The underlying philosophy is that over time stocks follow earnings and cash,"" he said. ""We look for companies that grow earnings and cash flow above market-average rates across economic cycles. We look for companies with strong competitive positions in growing industries that have pricing power, good management teams and quality characteristics such as recurring revenue, low capital intensity and attractive balance sheets.""And the fund is patient. ""We have a long investment time horizon, which you see in our low (annual) turnover,"" he said.The fund has not changed its approach during the recent market volatility. But the fund added to some names on price dips. ""Volatility in the market sometimes provides an opportunity to collectively add to secular growth companies that we like,"" Gordon said.Netflix's earnings per share grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past six quarters.As IBD reported Tuesday, Netflix stock gapped up that morning after it crushed expectations for new subscriber growth in the first quarter and guided higher than views for the current quarter.The streaming service's push into original programming is a key strategy.""Netflix has about 120 million subscribers around the world,"" Gordon said. ""They've had success ramping up subscribers. The real excitement (generated by their) January (earnings) call was the lack of (departures by customers) following their price increases, which proves the market's confidence in their long-term pricing power.""Lululemon's share price has uptrended for nearly a year, reversing an approximately yearlong downtrend. ""The issue that Lululemon faced was that it grew very rapidly for a number of years,"" Gordon said. ""They took several years to reinvest in the company, which hurt profitability. Now they seem to be coming out the other side.""Gordon added, ""As revenues continue to increase and costs increase at a slower pace, it benefits their earnings growth.""The fund trimmed modestly in recent disclosures. Gordon describes the trims as ""just selectively trimming some into (share price) strength.""Amazon, Gordon says, is firing on all cylinders. ""Its e-commerce business continues to take significant incremental share of every retail dollar that's spent,"" he said.He calls Amazon Web Services the No. 1 player in its space. ""To drive down costs to customers and invest in new services, a web services provider needs scale,"" he added. ""Amazon has that scale."" Also, it continues to post significant revenue growth, he says.The segment of Amazon's e-commerce business that involves third parties selling through Amazon — its so-called 3P business — has higher-margin growth than its 1P business, sales of inventory owned by Amazon itself, Gordon says.Adobe's share price barely slipped during the recent market volatility. Adobe owes its resilience to its leadership status and to its switch to subscription revenue from sales of packaged software. ""Adobe has very strong competitive positions in growing markets,"" Gordon said. ""And it continues to experience the benefits of moving to a subscription-based business model.""The MFS team likes both faces of Zoetis' business. Its farm-animal medicine business is steady because farmers can't afford to lose livestock. Its pet-medicine business thrives on sentimentality. ""The company calls it the humanization of pets,"" Gordon said. ""In the 1950s your dog slept in a doghouse. Now the dog sleeps on the bed with you.""Gordon added, ""Zoetis is the largest competitor in animal health, an industry growing in the mid-single digits with fewer risks than human health, given that there is no third-party payer risk.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeRetirement Savings: More Americans Than Ever Have $1 Million Or More

The month prior, ex-Kors exec Anna Bakst boarded Kate Spade as chief executive and brand president.Coach has pivoted from large logos (although those are notably coming back in style, particularly in China), pulled back from department stores shelves, revamped certain stores, and partnered up with pop star Selena Gomez on a purse collection.Coach is still a favorite brand over Kors among women and those with household incomes of more than $100,000, which indicates ""brand prestige and potential for greater full-price selling,"" noted Chen.And the Kate Spade brand, acquired barely a year ago, is still hugely popular, especially with women and the key millennial demo.""The percentage of women who believe carrying a Kate Spade bag makes them feel 'put together' increased among the Broad Premium Market, and 85% of women believe Kate Spade bags are 'fashionable' and 'on trend,' "" he wrote back in February.When Tapestry reports next week, Zacks Investment Research analysts expect a 9% profit increase to 50 cents a share on 31% sales growth to $1.302 billion.Shares closed up 0.5% at 53.44 on the stock market today and have jumped around 30% so far in 2018, trading at levels not seen since the start of 2014.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

1344,KEY,"United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday reported first-quarter results that beat estimates and signaled tighter cost control over the year as Wall Street focuses more on how airlines can counterbalance the rising price of jet fuel.XThe carrier reported first-quarter earnings per share of 50 cents, topping forecasts by a penny. Revenue came in at $9.032 billion, just beating analyst expectations for $9.013 billion. United's unit revenue, which gauges sales by way of an airline's overall flight coverage, rose 2.7%, in line with prior company forecasts.United said that it expected full-year non-fuel unit costs, excluding third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, to be flat to down 1% during the full year.United's plan to add more flights to smaller U.S. cities over the next three years has also raised worries that rivals might retaliate by slashing fares, drawing passengers but thinning profits. The airline narrowed its guidance on 2018 capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flights — and now sees it rising 4.5%-5.5%. In January, United said it expected capacity growth of 4%-6%.The carrier sees full-year earnings per share of $7.00-$8.50, narrowing an earlier forecast due to ""increased confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year."" Wall Street expected $7.83. For the second quarter, United forecast a unit revenue increase of 1%-3%. The carrier also sees second-quarter capacity increasing 4%-5%. United expects second-quarter adjusted pretax margins of 9%-11%. The company expects unit costs, excluding third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, to be flat to up 1% in Q2.Shares jumped 3% late in the stock market today, after ending the regular session virtually flat at 67.34.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Wall Street could stir up drama during the company's earnings conference call, set for Wednesday.After the company's third-quarter earnings call, its stock fell around 12%, with some investors not satisfied with how prepared the carrier was for this year. After United's fourth-quarter call, when it announced the expansion, the stock fell around 11%.Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported earnings last week, closed up 0.5% and added another 0.5% late. American Airlines (AAL) finished 1.4% lower but rallied 1% late. Southwest (LUV) fell 1.1%, after a Dallas-bound plane suffered an engine problem that forced an emergency landing and left one person dead.Strong international demand helped Delta, American and United during the quarter. But investors are likely to zero in on how airlines can keep costs lean as fuel gets more expensive, Cowen analysts said in a research note.Cowen said it expected unit revenue, a key efficiency gauge that measures airline revenue by its overall flight capacity, to be lower in the second quarter vs. the first. Holiday timing as well as extra seat and flight availability will likely push the metric lower, the firm said.Another concern on Wall Street is United's plan to add more flights to smaller U.S. cities over the next three years. That expansion, announced in January, tanked United's stock, as investors worried that other airlines might retaliate by slashing fares, which attracts passengers but brings thinner profits.Delta, during its first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, said that fuel costs would be the ""wild card"" for 2018, adding that the growth rate of nonfuel unit costs also was ""unacceptably high.""But the carrier plans to offer more premium seats on flights during the year, helping to offset some of that cost growth.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Southwest Outlook Hits Airlines, But Is United The 'Direct' Culprit?United Airlines, American To Wall Street: You Don't Get What We're DoingVirgin Atlantic Follows Delta, United, American With New Economy ClassAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

1347,KEY,"Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) cleared a flat base Tuesday, one day after the company introduced a way to deliver pizza without an address.The stock jumped past the 236.10 buy point. On April 2, Domino's stock climbed past that entry but sank right back into the base. Tuesday's move was more sure-footed, but it lacked the same key ingredient: volume. Trading was well below average levels, raising doubts.This week, Domino's launched curbside delivery to more than 150,000 hot spots in the U.S. The new services lets customers order pizza delivery to places that aren't necessarily residential addresses, such as parks.

""Looking forward, we expect the U.S. economy to expand at a faster than 3% growth rate, faster than the trajectory of the last several years, due to an uplift from a synchronized global recovery,"" the managers told shareholders in their Q4 commentary.They're betting on companies that they think can maintain above-average earnings growth no matter what the broad market is doing.

1350,KEY,"With nearly four months' worth of stock market action in 2018 now in the rear view mirror, the major indexes' story has been this: We let nice gains slip away.The lesson for investors? Don't let your gains do the same.The S&P 500, a 19% gainer in 2017, is down only a touch since Jan. 1. But the large-cap benchmark lost a more than 7% advance during the first 4-1/2 weeks of trading this year.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund is also down mildly this year. The road has been bumpy for months. Just days ago, the ETF stabbed below its 200-day moving average for the third time since Feb. 9.So far, the ETF has managed to rebound after the two prior tests of the long-term support level. But many stocks in the IBD 50 and outside this list have failed to reach new highs.Earnings and sales have shown robust increases, as seen in first-quarter results hitting equity traders' computer screens these past few weeks. But the market always looks ahead, and it always has something to consider and evaluate. Lately, the sharp rise in yield for the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond appears to be a front-burner issue.A new bull market in crude oil prices and the possibility of accelerating inflation also deserve prominent space in the current market picture.As an IBD-style investor, you'll want to always adjust your holding and selling strategy when the overall market shifts. Right now, with the current outlook at ""uptrend under pressure,"" taking profits more quickly is a smart strategy. If your stock is up, say, 15% from a proper buy point but is showing signs of fatigue, you can at least sell half the shares and keep watching.The longer you've played the game of buying on breakouts in good markets and sitting patiently for the stock to hit the 20% to 25% profit goal, the more likely you've seen a stock come up so close, then retreat fast.In other cases, some IBD 50 names act as if the 20% profit level is merely a pit stop. Indeed, in recent years, scores of high-quality growth stocks have risen 30%, 40%, 50% or even more past a proper buy point before sinking into a real correction. When you have supreme conviction and the overall market is healthy, go ahead and sit longer on your winners.But Casa Systems (CASA), which has occupied a spot in the IBD 50 for months, illustrates the importance of not being too greedy.The specialist in software for the cable and telecom markets debuted on the Nasdaq at 13 a share on Dec. 15, formed a very narrow IPO base in February, then broke out past a 22.60 entry on Feb. 27. On that day, the market was in a confirmed uptrend, thanks to a follow-through rally. Less than four weeks later, Casa hit a high of 34.21, up a stout 51%.Taking at least some gains turned out to be sound portfolio management. Casa cooled off and tried to clear a faulty cup base that lasted just four weeks. On April 24, shares plunged nearly 12% and undercut the 50-day moving average for the first time on news of a share offering. Two days later, Casa priced 7 million shares at 25 each. The share float was 20 million.Casa is also likely getting knocked by news that Charter Communications (CHTR) reported worse than expected results in video subscriber losses.Here's a quick look at some other IBD 50 names' recent action.Abiomed (ABMD): It's holding up fine after fading after a breakout past 304.38 in a new flat base. The base is late stage, a key risk. Keep in mind that the gains from a March 2017 breakout at 120.99 have hit 150%.Smart Global (SGH): Made a round trip after rising past a buy point in March and catapulting over four weeks. The stock made a sharp retreat, even after earnings roared 652% higher to $1.73 a share in the quarter ended in February. Revenue rose 83% to $314 million.Illumina (ILMN): A base next to a base is forming. Clear resistance is seen near 250.Viper Energy Partners (VNOM): Is not giving much back after it cleared a base with a 26.29 buy point. Gains have so far hit 13% amid a new bull run for crude oil prices.You can trade the IBD 50 in one click with Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY), managed by Innovator Capital.

1359,KEY,"The growing trade spat between the U.S. and China slammed the major indexes early on Wednesday, but the Nasdaq composite bounced back into positive ground and lifted its peer indexes higher. The leading index turned an early loss of nearly 1.9% to a gain of 0.8% in afternoon trading. Tesla (TSLA) led some automakers into positive ground.Tesla stock accelerated its rebound and throttled more than 5% higher to 283.24 in heavy volume. While at least three of the five FAANG stocks also reversed higher, consumer and construction-related shares led the upside. So did defensive sectors, including drugstore, meat, generic drugs, dairy and confectionery firms.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 erased a 1.6% loss and reversed to a gain of 0.7%. For the third day in a row, the large-cap benchmark undercut the long-term 200-day moving average. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.5%, as at least seven of its 30 components were up 1 point or more. They included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Home Depot (HD) and Apple (AAPL).In IBD Leaderboard, software, e-commerce and apparel firms continue to do relatively better. Retail chain Lululemon (LULU), which joined the Leaders list on Feb. 7, fell more than 1% to 87.52 in dull turnover. But the yogawear apparel leader remains more than 4% above a buy point near 84.The stock has advanced more than 38% since it cleared a bottoming base pattern at 64.91 in November.That bottoming base also served as a first-stage pattern. First- and second-stage bases tend to carry higher probabilities of success following a breakout from those bases.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseJust two of the Dow industrials' 30 components, industrial heavyweights Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), sank 1 point or more as investors fretted over China's expansion of retaliatory tariffs to cover more agricultural and manufactured goods.Caterpillar, off 1% to 143.64, is still holding above the 200-day moving average but is now around 17% below an all-time high of 173.24. Watch to see if the construction and mining gear titan can bottom out and begin to form the right side of a potential new base.A properly formed base sets up a market-leading stock in a position to possibly break out to new highs and stage a solid run. But today, IBD's current outlook for U.S. equities remains ""Market in correction,"" so breakouts are understandably few in number.Floor & Decor (FND) is one of the rare big movers today, rising more than 5% to 55.06 in heavy volume.The flooring products retailer, which imitates Home Depot's large warehouse-style model, is now extended more than 5% past a 51.58 buy point in an eight-week cup-style base. It's best to buy a stock no more than 5% past the proper buy point; buying too high in price can subject an investor to a quick loss if the stock makes a temporary pullback to or even mildly below the breakout entry.Floor & Decor, now a mid-cap stock with a market value of $5.3 billion, went public in April 2017 at 21 a share. It has a float of 84 million shares and currently ranks No. 22 within the IBD 50. The company has grown earnings per share 9%, 75%, 47%, 31% and 58% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. Sales jumped 25%, 31%, 29%, 27% and 40% over the same time frame.Going back to Tesla, the San Francisco-based firm still trades well below its 52-week peak of 389.61. Plus, the electric vehicle pioneer trades sharply below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. So the stock is nowhere close to a new IBD-style buy point.However, those who bought at the initial April 2013 breakout near 40 still hold a fantastic long-term gain.At this point, it makes sense to wait and watch for the possibility of heavy institutional buying to return. Trading near 280, Tesla is still an institutional favorite. The stock reached a total 1,000 mutual fund and hedge fund holders for the first time during the second quarter of 2016.That sponsorship has grown a bit more to 1,027 funds as of the first quarter of this year. In Q3 of 2017, that number reached 1,095 funds owning a total 54.4 million shares. Earlier this week, Tesla reported confidence in its goal to reach a significantly higher production rate of its Model 3 sedan within the next three months and said it has no plans to raise more capital via debt or equity offerings this year.The company said it built 2,020 Model 3 sedans in the final seven days of March and expects to see that run rate climb rapidly through the second quarter of this year.Tesla is racing to meet the mountain of 500,000 preorders made for the affordable all-electric four-door vehicle. The base price of the Model 3 is $35,000, but many new buyers are likely to add options.Elsewhere, homebuilding-related stocks advanced sharply following a blistering quarterly report from giant Lennar (LEN). The stock rose more than 8% to 61.97 and leapt back above the 50-day moving average for the first time in more than eight weeks.The Miami-based builder posted a sharp increase in earnings for the February-ended fiscal first quarter on a 28% jump in sales to $2.98 billion.LGI Homes (LGIH), a member of the IBD 50, ramped up more than 6% to 70.15 in below average trade. The stock continues to work on the right side of a cup-style pattern. The small cap rose 161% in 2017.Analysts see Q1 earnings rising 37% to 71 cents a share. LGI, which focuses on entry-level homes, grew its profits by 39% to $4.73 a share in 2017.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on growth stocks, new breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: How Should You Handle Boeing Now? How Are The Best Growth Stocks Doing?

1361,KEY,"When Mick Mulvaney, President Trump's acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, appeared before Congress last week, he managed to illustrate the absurdity of the agency that he heads.In questioning him, several Democrats disputed that Mulvaney even is the director, claiming that an Obama-era appointee retains authority — and they may actually have a point. This squabbling may seem like government-incompetence-as-usual, but in fact, the CFPB is working as intended — shielding elected officials from the opposition of lobbyists who don't want sensible financial rules and from the wrath of consumers who, a decade after the financial crisis, remain ill-served by an unbalanced financial system.The CFPB was born out of the 2008 meltdown. In 2010, two years after the crash, then-President Obama and a Democratic Congress enacted the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Dodd-Frank, in turn, created the CFPB, meant to ensure that ""consumers are protected from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices and from discrimination."" The CFPB does its work through education, investigation, and, importantly, rule making — that is, creating new rules to implement federal law concerning lending and other practices.But the CFPB is an odd duck. Congress created it within the Federal Reserve System to give it an independent funding stream, without the need for regular congressional appropriations. Congress also mandated that the CFPB's director, appointed by the president, would serve a five-year term, thus outlasting single presidential terms. A president cannot remove the director except for egregious misbehavior.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCongressional Democrats created this structure to insulate the CFPB from political pressure. Now, out of power, they're upset that Mulvaney is insulated from their pressure — including their assertion that he isn't the rightful director. A federal appeals court will decide whether Mulvaney is justifiably in charge.When Obama appointee Richard Cordray left the CFPB last year, his deputy, Leandra English, attempted to take over the role; Trump instead appointed Mulvaney. The statutory language is vague regarding the replacement of a departed CFPB director, which says something about how carefully Dodd-Frank was drafted.Meantime, Mulvaney is making himself useful. In his congressional testimony, he suggested four key reforms.First, he proposes that Congress amend Dodd-Frank so that the CFPB can be funded through regular budget approvals, like other federal agencies.Second, he wants Congress to adjust the law so that the CFPB director answers to the president, just as Cabinet officials do.Third, Mulvaney sensibly suggests the creation of an independent inspector general for the bureau — with proposed bureau rules potentially saving (or costing) banks billions of dollars, the temptation for bribery or other wrongdoing is high.Mulvaney's fourth idea is the most controversial. He would have Congress require ""affirmative legislative approval"" of all the bureau's ""major"" proposed rules. The concept violates a key tenet of good governance: It would treat the bureau differently from other regulatory agencies, such as the EPA and the FAA, instead of bringing it into line with how other agencies function.It would also encourage congressional micromanagement of federal agencies, which would paralyze government. Subjecting every IRS rule to a congressional vote, for instance, may sound like a conservative reform, but it would politicize every detail of federal administration.Nonetheless, forcing Congress to vote for or against consumer protections — with consequences for their campaign donations, not to mention votes — has some appeal. One of Cordray's last actions as director, for example, was to approve a rule governing ""payday lending"" and auto-title lending — high-interest-rate loans for poor and working-class people desperate to borrow cash.The rule, as far as it went, was anodyne: It required these lenders to determine in advance whether a borrower could repay the loan. Payday lenders have fought the rule, as their business model assumes that a high percentage of payday lenders will take out a new loan to ""repay"" the old one.After Cordray's departure, Congress could have scuttled the rule, but it has not acted on two introduced bills to do so. If it does not take action before early May, the rule will automatically take effect. It's no mystery why Congress isn't champing at the bit to vote ""yea"" or ""nay"" on helping poorer, less educated Americans get themselves into a vicious spiral of triple-digit interest-rate debt.The payday-lending industry is powerful, and it isn't shy about wielding its power: This month, it is holding its annual conference at a Trump-owned golf resort in Florida. Congress would rather leave the matter to the CFPB.Indeed, Mulvaney has started his own lengthy process to ""reconsider"" the rule internally. At his congressional hearing, Mulvaney said that the CFPB's ""lack of accountability to any representative branch of government should be a warning sign that a lapse of democratic structure and republican principles has occurred."" Yet the CFPB is doing exactly what Congress intended it to do: Keep elected officials from being accountable to the voters.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1362,KEY,"Nike (NKE) VP of Footwear Greg Thompson is the latest executive leaving his role at the company amid an internal review spurred by concerns of hiring and pay inequities, as well as workplace misconduct. Where this leaves the future of leadership at the world's largest athletic brand is unclear.The wave of exits began with Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards, once seen as a potential successor to CEO Mark Parker, who stepped down from his role in March. His lieutenant Jayme Martin, VP and general manager of global categories, was reportedly forcibly ousted around the same time.Antoine Andrews, VP of diversity, has also stepped down, per Monday reports. And two more have been ousted in recent days. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported late Tuesday the departures of Vikrant Singh, a Nike Basketball senior brand director in North America, and Daniel Tawiah, a VP of global brand digital-marketing innovation.The reasons for their forced exits are unclear. Female employees reportedly circulated a survey discussing inappropriate behavior, pay levels and gender imbalances at the company. A ""boy's club""-like environment is said to pervade the sportswear titan.""We became aware of some behavioral issues that are inconsistent with Nike's values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment,"" said Parker in the company's earnings call in mid-March. ""I'm committed to ensure that we have an environment where every Nike employee can have a positive experience and reach their full potential.""But he also said in that same call that Nike has a ""deep leadership bench,"" and did not appear at the time to be outwardly concerned about replacing talent, though those comments only followed the departures of Edwards and Martin.Nike shares closed down 0.7% at 65.73 on the stock market today, after losing 1.9% Wednesday. Under Armour (UAA) dipped 0.1%, and Adidas (ADDYY) sold off 1.8%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYet to be seen is whether Parker's initiative to restructure leadership and transform company culture will have any impact on Nike's sales.

Despite some progress on those fronts, problems have continued to mount.Notably, GE lowered its 2018 profit outlook and disclosed an SEC probe of its accounting practices. Investors responded by dumping its stock afresh, which now sits at its worst level since 2009.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShares closed up 2.4% at 13.99 on the stock market today. Fellow Dow Jones industrial average industrial conglomerates United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM), finished 0.8% and 0.3% lower, respectively.Here are five key areas to watch:Aviation is in the spotlight, after a jet engine made by GE's joint venture with Snecma blew apart in midair Tuesday, forcing a Southwest Airlines (LUV) flight to make an emergency landing and killing one passenger.Last week's accounting restatement also raised some flags. The aviation unit is the ""crown jewel"" of GE's vast business portfolio, according to investment research firm Morningstar.However, restated profits in aviation were flat in 2017 vs. 2016, JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa said earlier this week. Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna chimed in that ""aviation profits were flattish"" despite a much more favorable backdrop in 2017 than it can expect in 2018.Higher oil prices will weigh on the unit, he said. Plus, deliveries of the advanced but loss-making LEAP jet engines are expected to ramp up.GE Power will also be in focus after Flannery's promise to ""reset, refocus, and renew"" the deeply troubled flagship unit. Power's earnings crumbled 45% in 2017. GE has warned that the gas-turbine market was ""far more challenging"" than it foresaw in 2017 and that the pain could persist into 2019.Management's 2018 outlook is unrealistic and will likely have to be lowered, analysts caution.Goldman Sachs' Joe Ritchie warned Monday that a cut to GE's $1.00-$1.07 EPS guidance for 2018 is ""almost a certainty"" after the restatements. He thinks it could happen during the Q1 earnings report.Cowen's Khanna is less certain that the compnay will cut its guidance this quarter, but warns it will ""capitulate"" sometime this year.Analysts on average expect full-year 2018 EPS of 96 cents, following a lowering of estimates in the past four weeks, according to Zacks Investment Research.The continued deterioration in GE Power is a big reason why analysts think the company will have to walk back its numbers.Cash is top of mind for Flannery — and investors in General Electric.For 2018, GE is targeting $6 billion to $7 billion in free cash flow. It needs $4.2 billion just to support its newly reduced dividend. Any cut to cash flow guidance will be another blow to investors who had long prized it as one of the best income stocks.Amid cash flow challenges, the company halved its annual dividend in November to 48 cents.""The dividend may be trimmed again,"" Khanna cautioned Thursday, reiterating a view shared earlier by both Cowen and JPMorgan. A slumping GE stock has raised the dividend yield to 3.5%.Contract assets grew $3.7 billion in 2017 to $28.86 billion. It's an area of concern, not only because those assets have swelled in recent years but also because its contract accounting is now drawing regulatory scrutiny.Contract assets reflect revenues that the company books on long-term equipment and service contracts before it gets the cash in hand.GE may address plans to convert its contract assets to cash in its call with analysts Friday, following the earnings release. In 2017, cash flows from contract assets were below GE's own expectations.Besides contract assets, management will also likely be pressed on plans to dispose of $20 billion in assets.So far, its deals have been relatively small fry, including a sale of its industrial solutions business for $2.6 billion and the sale of a health care technology unit for $1 billion. Proceeds from asset sales will help support the dividend.As GE mulls smaller asset sales, it has kept the option of a bigger breakup in play, with the core aviation, power and health units becoming separately traded assets.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?GE's Factory-In-A-Box Will Help It Expand This Key Business As Power WiltsGE Engine In Spotlight As Southwest, NTSB Probe Fatal FlightIs There A Way To Make A Million Dollars By Trading ETFs?

1389,KEY,"Scandal: Whatever James Comey's motives were for writing memos about his meetings with President Trump, they reveal how duplicitous the former FBI Director was with the new president.News of those memos first broke last May, after Comey gave four of the seven he'd written to a friend, who then shared some of the details with the New York Times — details designed to make it appear that Trump was attempting to obstruct justice in the ongoing Russia investigation. Comey later admitted that he leaked the memos in hopes that it would prompt the appointment of a special counsel. Which, of course, it did.Now, nearly a year later, we finally have the chance to see the complete Comey memos — minus a few redactions. (You can read them here.)But the picture that emerges most clearly from them is not one of a crazed, deranged Trump trying to obstruct the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling. If anything, Trump comes across as sympathetic.Instead, Comey manages by his own hand to show how he repeatedly lied and deceived Trump, and how he purposely withheld information from him knowing full well that by doing so he was hurting Trump's ability to do his job.Here's a rundown.In his first memo, dated January 7, Comey recounts the meeting in which he briefed Trump on the dossier. He says he did so because reporters already had the information.But then he told Trump that the press hadn't reported on it yet because they ""were looking for a news hook"" and stressed to Trump that ""it was important that we not give them the excuse to write that the FBI has the material.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe says Trump was surprised that the press hadn't already run with the story, to which Comey replied ""they would get killed for reporting straight up from the source reports.""It turns out it was Comey himself who gave the press the hook they were looking for. Just days after, CNN used Comey's briefing of Trump as the very pretext to report on the dossier that, up until that point, they'd refused to touch.In other words, it's far less likely that Comey briefed Trump because he was worried the press would report on the dossier, and more likely that he briefed Trump to ensure that those details would leak.Further evidence that Comey wasn't being honest with Trump comes in his Jan. 28 memo, in which he fundamentally changes the reason given for why he briefed Trump in the first place.In that memo, he says the reason he gave Trump the briefing was because ""the media, CNN in particular, was telling us they were about to run with it.""Comey also relates in his memos how Trump repeatedly asked him to investigate the claim in the dossier about Trump hiring prostitutes in Moscow to pee on a bed that President Obama had slept in.Comey advises against it because ""I wouldn't want to create a narrative that we were investigating him,"" and that ""it is very difficult to prove a lie.""But at the time, Comey could have easily put that story to rest, because he knew that the dossier was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. All he had to do was tell Trump, or the public, and the entire story would have been dismissed as a Democratic smear campaign.Instead, he never told Trump the truth about the dossier's origins. He told ABC News this month that he didn't because ""it wasn't necessary for my goal.""Wasn't necessary for his goal?In fact, out of all the leaks coming out of the FBI about Trump, the origins of the dossier remained the best kept secret in Washington all the way until October 2017.In his March 30 memo, Comey says Trump talked about the pall the Russia story was casting over his presidency. He ""said he was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that difficult.""Trump told Comey that ""he was trying to make deals for the country, the cloud was hurting him (and mentioned going to G-7 with it hanging over him), and he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn't being investigated.""According to his memos, Comey repeatedly assured Trump that he wasn't being investigated, and Trump repeatedly asked him to make that publicly known so he could do his job.""I told him I would see what we could do,"" Comey wrote in March. But Comey admitted later that he had no intention of doing so.The topic of FBI leaks comes up several times in the Comey memos. At one point he told Trump how ""I was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message.""At the time, however, Comey likely knew that his own deputy director, Andrew McCabe, had authorized a leak to the Wall Street Journal in 2016 regarding the status of the FBI's investigation into the Clinton Foundation. That's what McCabe claims, at least.And for all we know, Comey knew about or authorized the leak about his briefing Trump on the dossier.He also kept telling Trump how McCabe was a ""true professional,"" and ""you would come to value him.""But Comey also likely knew that McCabe had for weeks sat on the discovery that many of Hillary Clinton's State Department emails were on Anthony Weiner's laptop.Not exactly the mark of a ""top pro.""But the biggest lie Comey makes in his memos is when he tells Trump how ""he could count on me to always tell the truth.""""I said I don't do sneaky things. I don't leak. I don't do weasel moves.""Yet everything Comey has done — both the things he recounts in the memos and what he's done since — proves the exact opposite.He leaked classified information contained in at least one memo. He misled Trump repeatedly. He withheld key information about the dossier's funding. He did all this knowing it would undermine the presidency.The irony of it all is that Comey is now raking in vast sums of money peddling his memoirs, which he titled: ""A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Is James Comey A Serial Liar?FBI's Andy McCabe Faces Possible Criminal Charges — Are Hillary Clinton & Co.

1394,KEY,"Clinton Scandal: After months of fruitless investigations of the supposed ""collusion"" between the Trump campaign and Russia, 11 fed-up congressional Republicans have said ""enough."" They want an investigation of the Democrats' collusion with top Justice Department officials and the FBI to ruin Trump in the 2016 election, and after. Get ready for a legal donnybrook.The 11 sent a letter on Wednesday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions seeking criminal investigations of those for whom there's actual evidence of a crime, among them former FBI Director James Comey, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and high-level FBI operatives Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.But this isn't the only iron in the fire, right now.Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has quietly been investigating the entire mare's nest of collusion, lies and political machinations by those surrounding both former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It's now bearing fruit.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNo sooner had the congressional letter landed in Sessions' office than it was revealed late Thursday that Horowitz has already referred McCabe to the U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C. for criminal charges.He's also investigating the FBI's actions during the 2016 presidential campaign, and collusion with the State Department. The next report is due as early as next month.So the criminal cascade of the Democrats' plan to subvert Trump's campaign is beginning. It all started with Hillary Clinton's machinations to win the presidency and discredit Trump with a phony ""dossier"" ginned up by former British spy Christopher Steele, but paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.That dossier was in part used as a pretense for the FBI to spy on the Trump campaign. In effect, the Obama FBI and Justice Department became adjuncts of the Hillary for President campaign. Don't bother looking it up: It's illegal.If McCabe is the first, will Hillary Clinton be next? Or will she avoid charges entirely? After months of denial and obfuscation by Hillary, the FBI, Justice and the former Obama administration, the truth may finally be known. Let's hope so.The congressional letter seeking an official investigation lists a number of ""potential violations of federal statutes"" by former high-level Obama administration appointees.If you read IBD regularly, most of them are pretty well known.They include Comey's botched handling of the Clinton email scandal and leaking of classified information, Clinton's ""disguising payments to Fusion GPS on mandatory disclosures to the Federal Election Commission,"" Lynch's threatening retaliation against a former FBI informant who came forward with information on the Uranium One Deal and McCabe's multiple lies under oath.Also, ""With regard to top counterintelligence FBI agent, Peter Strzok, and senior FBI lawyer Lisa Page, we raise concerns regarding their interference in the Hillary Clinton investigation regarding her use of a personal email server,"" the letter from the congressional 11 said.Any of these, if true, would warrant prosecution.Is this the skeleton key that opens the closet of the Deep State's secrets?The investigation of the Clinton email scandal is of particular interest. It ties together many of the high-powered  people mentioned in the congressional letter.  All of them, it appears, colluded to help Hillary win in 2016 — or, at minimum, to keep Trump from winning. It's a distinction without a difference.Despite reams of evidence, Hillary Clinton has so far skated when it comes to the public investigations of her behavior during the email scandal, the Uranium One scandal, the Benghazi scandal, the Clinton Foundation scandal, and so much else.In effect, Horowitz is doing the job that the Robert Mueller Russian collusion investigation should have been doing from the very start.No doubt, Democrats, Hillary partisans and Never Trumpers will scream that this is all a political witch hunt. It isn't. The evidence is growing that serious crimes were committed by Justice Department and FBI officials seemingly acting in silent collusion with the Clinton campaign.If so, it dwarfs the Watergate scandal in magnitude, and warrants prison terms — not mere slaps on the wrist.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Why No Investigation Into FBI, Justice Dept.

1405,KEY,"Starbucks (SBUX), faced with concerns of slowing growth, outlined on its earnings call late Thursday its new promotions and marketing strategy to bring more java drinkers to its U.S. cafes.While its summertime Frappuccino Happy Hour, i.e. a broad discount available to anyone who happened to walk into a Starbucks at the right time of day, ""worked for a few years,"" the offer has not been as appealing ""from a profitability standpoint"" in recent years, said management.The company now plans to structure its offers in a more targeted fashion, and on a range of products beyond Frappuccinos throughout the year. In late March, the coffee shop chain said that only customers who had received invitations would be able to get 50% espresso beverages from 3 p.m. to close. Those invitations come via email or the Starbucks app.So far, the results have been encouraging. The company tried out its new  approach during the quarter and reported ""strong incremental profit"" that ""appealed disproportionately"" to customers that were not yet signed up for its Starbucks Rewards program, said executives on the call Thursday.""We are optimistic about what we saw in response to happy hours and we are seeing greater response from happy hours from our non-(rewards customers) versus (rewards) customers, so everything is very early, but it's very promising,"" said Starbucks Global Chief Strategy Officer Matt Ryan.The company said it also plans on introducing a new Frappuccino next week.Shares are sliding late after closing up 2.9% to 59.38 in the stock market today, gapping up above their 50-day average, as the stock builds the handle in a cup-with-handle base with 60.80 entry point.After the closing bell Thursday, Starbucks met Q2 earnings views and just squeaked by revenue forecasts, following Dunkin' Brands' (DNKN) solid earnings beat in the morning.Starbucks posted EPS of 53 cents on sales of $6.03 billion. Same-store sales rose 2% globally and in the U.S., said the company.Zacks Investment Research analysts expected an 18% rise in profit to 53 cents a share on 11% revenue growth to $5.899 billion, per Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales at company-owned locations were seen growing 1.9%, including 1.8% comps in the key Americas market, according to Consensus Metrix estimates.""While we continue to be pleased with the sustained growth from espresso, tea, and improvements in throughput during peak hours, we still worry that SBUX does not have the meaningful initiatives to improve its sales trajectory to support valuation expansion,"" wrote Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh late Thursday, before the call started.For the year, Starbucks reaffirmed fiscal 2018 guidance for $2.48-$2.53 EPS and high-single-digit revenue growth, but noted that the current outlook doesn't account for its planned store closings on May 29.Management remained bullish on its plans for China, an area of growth for the company.Starbucks only has a Relative Strength rating of 46, meaning that it is outperforming 46% of other publicly traded companies. But the RS line is spiking higher and near a recent high. Shares have largely been trading sideways since late 2015, hitting an all-time high of 64.68 in June of last year.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

1419,KEY,"Less than two weeks after Germany refused to participate in U.S.-led airstrikes intended to punish Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons, Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives in Washington tomorrow to ask President Trump to keep waiving sanctions against Iran — Assad's financial underwriter. Trump should respond by inviting Merkel to join a transatlantic coalition to impose maximum pressure on both Iran and Syria, whose aggression and atrocities represent grave violations of the principles Germany has embraced since 1945.The persuasion of Merkel may be a tall order for Trump, given recent trends. In 2017, Germany led the European Union with some 3.5 billion euros (roughly $4.2 billion) in exports to Iran — a spike of more than a third from the prior year. According to recent reports, parts sold by a German company were even found in the wreckage of an Iranian-made rocket that the Assad regime used to deliver chemical weapons in Syria.Given the trajectory of German-Iranian commerce, Merkel's determination to keep Trump in the Iran nuclear deal might make sense in a vacuum. After all, if the U.S. reimposes sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran, German banks will be forced to halt all Iran-related transactions and dramatically reduce bilateral trade.But we don't live in a vacuum. Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, is anything but a normal trading partner — and Germany has a unique responsibility to oppose atrocities, even if there is a financial cost to pay.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29
"
1420,KEY,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start HereThe painful memories evoked by footage of children choking to death on poison gas should drive Merkel to assume a leadership role in the effort to hold Assad accountable. Likewise, Iranian threats to wipe out the Jewish state should be a call to action. That means applying maximum pressure on both Assad and his Iranian underwriters, including the Central Bank of Iran.Right now, Germany's position on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the Iranian nuclear deal is formally known, amounts to an abdication of historic responsibilities. If Merkel wants to persuade Trump to stay in the deal, she must accept two basic truths: First, Europe's fear of undermining the JCPOA has deterred them from holding Iran and Syria accountable in any way. Second, the nuclear deal's visible flaws, such as a failure to address ballistic missiles, provide Iran with a patient path to building the weapons that could wipe Israel off the map.Despite reported progress this week between Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron toward reaching a transatlantic agreement to (correct) the deal's flaws, concerns about both missiles and non-nuclear sanctions may yet lead Trump to exit the deal.Under the framework being negotiated, Europe reportedly wants to apply minor sanctions on Iran's existing short and medium range ballistic missile arsenal while reserving the toughest sanctions for nonexistent longer-range missiles. The problem for Trump? This would be a departure from past United Nations Security Council resolutions calling on Iran to cease work on all nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, regardless of range.Additionally, it could give Tehran an implicit green light to perfect missiles targeting Israel — something no American president can or should allow. Nor should a German chancellor, for that matter.Merkel could increase the odds of keeping Trump in the JCPOA if she agreed to a full ""snapback"" of pre-JCPOA sanctions in response to Iranian development of any nuclear-capable missile. If Iran wants to keep its sanctions relief — and with its currency in free fall the mullahs most certainly do — the regime should have to put its missile program on ice.The second issue, non-nuclear sanctions, is critical for any Syria strategy to be successful. In 2015, the Obama administration promised that nothing in the JCPOA would preclude the West from imposing tough sanctions on Iran for illicit activities unrelated to its nuclear program, including terrorism, weapons proliferation and human rights.Regardless, no sanctions have been imposed for non-nuclear reasons on any entity for which sanctions were suspended under the JCPOA. Why? International fear that doing so, even if technically allowed, would trigger an Iranian exit from the deal.In the case of Syria, that status quo is untenable. The Central Bank of Iran and the Export Development Bank of Iran, for example, are key pillars in Iran's financial sponsorship of the Assad regime. A strategy to exert maximum pressure on Assad that grants blanket immunity to his Iranian underwriters is doomed to fail.To ensure that this fatal flaw of the JCPOA does not carry over to a transatlantic ""fix,"" Merkel should offer to publicly recognize the legitimacy of reimposing sanctions for non-nuclear reasons on any entity for which sanctions were initially suspended under the deal. That includes Iran's central bank for its support of the Assad regime.If Merkel wants to mend her relationship with Trump and keep him in the nuclear deal, there's a path for success in front of her. Otherwise, she'd better tell her businesses back home to prepare for an American exit.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1421,KEY,"American Airlines (AAL) on Thursday cut its full-year profit forecast due to higher jet-fuel costs, while Southwest Airlines (LUV) served up a weak sales outlook following an engine blowout on a flight this month that left one passenger dead.Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) reported first-quarter earnings per share that beat analyst expectations. But revenue came up short.Even as higher fuel costs threaten industry profits, travel demand for American and rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) has remained solid. American on Thursday said it expects second-quarter 2018 unit revenue to rise 1.5%-3.5% year over year, citing ""expected continued strength in demand for both business and leisure travel.""However, due to higher fuel prices, the carrier lowered its adjusted full-year earnings-per-share forecast to $5-$6 a share, lower than an earlier outlook for $5.50-$6.50. Analysts had expected $5.74.Shares were down 6.4% at 42.37 in the stock market today but tumbled as much as 10.2% earlier. Delta and United lost 2.8%.For the first quarter, American said unit revenue, or an airline's sales when looked at in relation to its overall flight capacity, rose 3.5%, hitting the midpoint of its own forecasts for a 3%-4% gain. American saw the key industry metric pick up across all its regions, singling out Latin America as a particular area of strength.Earnings surged 23% to 75 cents per share in Q1, beating estimates by a penny, as revenue climbed 6% to $10.4 billion, compared to views for $10.412 billion. But American said that fuel costs jumped 26% during the quarter.Southwest said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to fall 1%-3%, adding that roughly ""one to two points of this estimated decrease is attributable to recent softness in bookings following the Flight 1380 accident.""That accident occurred on April 17 when the left engine of a Boeing (BA) 737 — the workhorse jets that make up Southwest's fleet — ripped open on a flight en route to Dallas from New York. Shrapnel from the explosion shattered a window on the plane, partially pulling a passenger out of the plane. The passenger, Jennifer Riordan, was later pronounced dead at a hospital after the plane made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.The National Transportation Safety Board said the engine, made by a General Electric (GE) joint venture, had shown signs of metal fatigue after a fan blade had broken off from it. The carrier canceled some 40 flights on Sunday for inspections.""It remains a somber time for the Southwest Family following the Flight 1380 accident, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the Riordan family, and all of our customers on the flight,"" CEO Gary Kelly said in a statement today.""We continue to cooperate with the National Transportation Safety Board's thorough investigation to understand the cause of the accident,"" the statement continued.But the carrier, which has built its reputation on low fares, could face more scrutiny from analysts and investigators in the wake of the accident. The accident also follows a ""60 Minutes"" report that raised questions about Allegiant Air's (ALGT) safety record.The accident's effect on Southwest's booked flights was harsher than some analysts anticipated.""Our initial thought would be that the 1-2 pts is much more of an impact than we would have expected particularly in the context of Allegiant, whose bookings returned to normal after several days,"" Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi said in a research note.Southwest's first-quarter earnings per share rose 23% to 75 cents, matching Zacks estimates, although other consensus forecasts came in at 74 cents. Revenue rose nearly 2% to $4.94 billion, just shy of estimates for $5.018 billion.Shares tumbled 1% to 53.30 on Thursday.Southwest last month lowered its first-quarter unit revenue forecast, citing in part, ""the competitive fare environment that continues to pressure passenger revenue yields"". Cowen analysts said they thought the pressure could have been a result of United's planned expansion into smaller cities over the next three years.Meanwhile, ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines' EPS slipped to 44 cents, beating views by a cent, while revenue climbed 19% to $704.14 million, missing estimates for $705 million.Shares tumbled 5.9% to 35.40.Earlier this month, Delta and United sailed through their first-quarter earnings calls, with both companies lifting industry stocks on solid global demand, helped by pricier seats at the front of the cabin. However, as oil costs rise, Delta noted that fuel would be a ""wild card"" in its 2018 profit forecast.But after two earnings calls in which United's plans — or apparent lack thereof — alarmed investors, the carrier last week focused on its bullish global revenue outlook. Analysts suggested the investor goodwill toward United was as much about what it didn't say during the call as what it said.""For good reasons many were nervous about UAL's call, but it was solid and measured,"" Wolfe Research analyst Hunter Keay said in a research note on Friday. ""UAL mainly talked about itself and not others, which is what good companies do, and gave people no reasons to panic about the space.""Similarly, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth, in a note last week, said United had benefited from a ""lack of controversy"" and a ""lack of aggressive pricing commentary.""Wall Street has been worried that United's plans to expand its flight coverage in the U.S. would prompt other carriers to expand as well, starting a fare-matching war that would damage profits. United's willingness to match discount carriers on their own lower ticket prices has also dismayed investors.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Southwest Airlines Traffic Caps Wild Week For Delta Air, Other Airline StocksUnited Airlines, American To Wall Street: You Don't Get What We're DoingAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

1422,KEY,"Raytheon (RTN) expects missile defense demand to remain strong, in the Asia region specifically, regardless of what happens in expected U.S.-North Korea talks, as the maker of the Patriot defense system reported strong Q1 earnings.The Trump administration dispatched CIA Director Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang earlier for preliminary discussions, and negotiations between President Trump and Kim Jong-Un may start in the next month or so. Meanwhile, North Korea has already announced it would stop nuclear missile tests.But Raytheon CFO Toby O'Brien told IBD that he sees demand across all regions of the world and doesn't see that slowing down any time soon.Regional customers also continue to modernize their arsenals with increased demand for new capabilities, such as the latest version of the Standard Missile-3 and the Standard Missile-6.The Patriot missile-defense system remained a strong driver of Q1 results. Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems unit saw sales rise 7% to $1.49 billion, led by an international Patriot contract award. During Q1, the unit booked over $2 billion for Patriot capabilities to the U.S. and its allies.Earnings per share from continuing operations jumped 27% to $2.20, beating Zacks Investment Research estimates by 10 cents. Net sales climbed 4.5% to $6.27 billion, better then views for $6.17 billion.Intelligence, Information and Services revenue grew 5% to $1.58 billion. Missile Systems sales climbed 5% to $1.85 billion, led by higher net sales on classified programs. Space and Airborne Systems sales edged up 1% to $1.57 billion.Missile sales should get a further boost after the State Department cleared the way last month for Saudi Arabia to buy nearly 6,700 Raytheon anti-tank missiles following Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's visit to Washington, D.C., as the Trump administration relaxes export restrictions on U.S. weapons.Bookings improved to $6.3 billion from $5.7 billion a year ago. Total backlog at the end of Q1 was $38.14 billion, down from $38.21 billion at the end of 2017 but up from $36.05 billion a year ago. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $283 million compared to an outflow of $41 million a year ago.Raytheon now sees full-year EPS at $9.70-$9.90, above consensus for $9.69 and up from its prior views of $9.55-$9.75, on net sales of $26.5 billion-$27 billion, vs. consensus for $26.81 billion, up from a prior view of $26.4 billion-$26.9 billion. Management still sees 2018 operating cash flow at $3.6 billion-$4 billion but said it is also tracking above views.""We delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter with our sales, earnings per share and cash flow all ahead of our expectations,"" Chairman and CEO Thomas Kennedy said in a statement.Shares were down 1.2% at 211.09 on the stock market today, slipping into sell territory intraday after breaking out last week.

1425,KEY,"The stock market resumed sharp declines in late afternoon trade Thursday and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2%, trading practically at session lows. Boeing (BA) got hammered again, losing more than 12 points albeit in below average turnover. The number of components in the 30-stock Dow losing 2 points or more jumped to a dozen.Two of the Dow's financial components, Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), also fell sharply and both were finding minimal buying support after they undercut their 50-day moving average lines in fairly heavy volume. Bank of America (BAC), another money center bank, gapped down and dropped more than 3% while slashing through its own 50-day line.At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite dropped around 1.6% to 1.8%. Volume was running sharply higher on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday.Boeing, which triggered a key sell signal last week, failed in its attempt to retake its 50-day moving average. Such action increases the prospects that a deeper correction could be in the works.Fears over fresh $50 billion tariffs on China imports, and how China may retaliate, enveloped Wall Street trading desks. Losing stocks beat winners by a more than 2-1 margin on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.Semiconductor equipment, internet content, ethical drugs, steel, air freight transport, oil drilling, coal, accident and health insurance and mortgage services also led the decline with drops of more than 2%.Semiconductors represent the fourth largest U.S. export product, and industry leaders voiced cautious support for the tariffs against certain Chinese imports in which the punitive actions are deemed appropriate. But Semiconductor Industry Association CEO John Neuffer called on the White House to take measures that protect companies' intellectual property.""U.S. semiconductor companies invest nearly one-fifth of their revenue in research and development to stay at the forefront of innovation. They should be able to compete in foreign markets without putting their critical IP at risk,"" Neuffer said in a statement.

It's holding on to an 11% gain since breaking out of a cup with deep handle at 109.50. Nvidia (NVDA) fell 2.7% to 241.85 but turnover was quiet and the leading graphics processor firm is still trading above its 50-day moving average, a bullish sign.Both MKS and Nvidia get a spot in IBD's Sector Leaders list of top-performing companies as of Wednesday's close.

The Dow utility average rallied 1.4%, but at 689 the index is still down 4.8% since Jan. 1.The S&P 500 is battling to stay near breakeven, The Nasdaq composite, at 7249 and trying to hug its rising 50-day moving average, is up 5%.JPMorgan undercut its 50-day moving average four times in quick succession during the market's early-February correction. Yet JPMorgan actually closed beneath the 50-day line just once during that period. Watch to see if the megacap money center bank can show renewed strength.On IBD Stock Checkup, JPMorgan gets a decent 83 Relative Price Strength Rating, but keep in mind that the RS Rating is less useful as a near-term selling indicator. Why? The RS Rating tracks 12 months' worth of price performance. The bank's Composite Rating is much more pedestrian at 69, but at 111.84 the stock still commands a good year-to-date gain of 4.6%.At 2657, the S&P 500 is now down roughly 0.6%  for the year. The large-cap index also now stands 7.5% below its January peak of 2872, so it's too far away from returning to a decline that fits the size of an intermediate correction.The Street currently sees JPMorgan's earnings rising 30% to $8.90 a share in 2018 and another 10% in 2019.Other money center banks also showed unsettling action.Citigroup (C) had a great January, posting new 52-week highs and rising to as high as 80.70.

1428,KEY,"President Donald Trump has ordered government agencies to expedite and expand arms sales abroad, including easing limits on exports of drones with military capabilities.X""Within 60 days we are called upon to create a work plan"" for speedier approvals of foreign military sales in cooperation with defense contractors and industry groups, Tina Kaidanow, a principal deputy assistant secretary in the State Department, told reporters on a conference call Thursday.While much of the new initiative will involve salesmanship -- Kaidanow said the government needs to do ""a better job of strategic advocacy"" -- a significant immediate move eases Obama administration restrictions on exports of unmanned aerial systems, or drones.""Although the U.S. leads the way in UAS technology, overly restricted policies enacted by the previous administration"" made exports difficult and allowed competitors including China to move quickly into a market forecast to reach $50 billion a year in the next decade, Peter Navarro, the White House director of trade and industrial policy, said on the call.The changes include allowing direct commercial sales that don't have to go through the government by companies that obtain an export permit and eliminating special scrutiny of laser devices on drones that can be used for military targeting.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump previewed plans for a new approach toward weapons sales during an appearance in Florida with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday.In the past, Trump said, ""it would be in some cases years before orders would take place because of bureaucracy with Department of Defense, State Department. We are short-circuiting that. It's now going to be a matter of days. If they're our allies we are going to help them get this important, great military equipment.""Trump has frequently used appearances with foreign leaders to pitch the benefits of U.S. weapons sales and his push to bolster defense spending by NATO allies is expected to aid American companies. Recent State Department approvals for weapons sales included $300 million of rockets and support equipment to Qatar and $2.9 billion in weapons, including F-16 jets, to Slovakia.The president's promise of approval for weapons exports in ""days"" is unlikely.Sales, even to close allies, will continue to be reviewed under criteria including whether they support national security interests, how they affect the military balance in the country's region and whether they might have an adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness.The policy announced Thursday wouldn't truncate the elaborate back-and-forth between a prospective foreign customer and the State Department and military services to determine a country's requirements, supply pricing and availability information and sign a formal ""letter of offer and acceptance"" before the package goes to Congress.Under long-standing practice, Congress has the key role in determining whether a proposed arms sale gets final approval.The State Department typically submits proposed sales for an informal notification period of about three weeks that's followed by a formal, publicly released document that Congress has as long as 30 days to approve. This formal congressional notification and review period for NATO allies is 15 days.Kaidanow said the salesmanship challenge includes recognizing ""that because the quality of our product is so high, sometimes, for example, it is more expensive than others."" She said the review would include ""financial advocacy"" that would help other countries buy U.S. products.Administration officials insisted human rights -- including the risk of civilian casualties -- will remain a consideration in arms sales. But they repeated a mantra that ""economic security is national security.""""When we enable our allies and partners to more easily obtain appropriate American defense articles and services, we improve our national security,"" Navarro said. ""Partners who procure American weaponry are more capable of fighting alongside us and ultimately more capable of protecting themselves with fewer American boots on the ground.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1429,KEY,"The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed Wednesday a revision of its conflict-of-interest rules for brokers. The proposal would beef up existing SEC requirements but stop short of the stricter fiduciary rule that the Department of Labor created in 2016.DOL's fiduciary rule was struck down by a mid-March ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. The new SEC proposal calls for implementation of a ""best interest"" standard for brokers. The SEC action opens a 90 day period of public comment before the SEC actually makes a rule.Some corners of the financial industry applauded the SEC's more-cautious tack. The Insured Retirement Institute said in a release, ""We are particularly appreciative of the Commission's commitment to collaborating with their counterparts at the DOL, FINRA (Financial Industray Regulatory Authority), and the state insurance and securities departments around the country to develop a cohesive and consistent regulatory framework. ""Brandan McGarry, of Kaufman Dolowich & Voluck, told IBD that the "" 'best interest' standard for broker-dealers will likely receive criticism from proponents of the DOL fiduciary rule as being too lenient on broker-dealers."" He added, ""The proposal may also receive criticism from industry participants as being too vague regarding the definition of 'best interest.' ""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn fact, a fiduciary standard typically requires someone to act in a client's best interest. So the SEC will have to clarify how its proposal would resemble or differ from a fiduciary rule, McGarry said via email.McGarry also said that the SEC's proposed document for disclosing potential conflicts of interest goes beyond what the DOL required.McGarry represents securities broker-dealers, directors and officers of financial institutions, and registered investment advisers in litigation and regulatory matters.The DOL rule imposed a fiduciary standard, requiring all financial advisors to work in their clients' best interests and to steer clear of any conflict of interest in choosing investments for retirement accounts.Before Wednesday's SEC action, Jamie Hopkins, retirement income program co-director at The American College, said: ""(It) appears that the SEC might stop a bit short of requiring everyone to adhere to a true and broad based fiduciary model. . . Some (people) will likely complain the rule does not go far enough and others will challenge it as going too far.""For that reason, Hopkins expects any SEC rule will be ""merely a step towards rule-making and a more well-defined fiduciary standard.""Hopkins also believes that brokerages will be less hostile to the SEC proposal than many were to the DOL rule. He said, ""(The) SEC appears more willing (than the DOL was) to work with brokerage houses in crafting a rule that does not destroy their business model, create significant backlash, but still moves the industry forward towards a more fiduciary-like model.""The American College focuses on education for members of the financial services and insurance industries.A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute (ICI), an industry group representing mutual funds, told IBD that the group stands by its February public comment letter to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, calling for the establishment of a ""best interest"" standard of conduct for broker-dealers.The ICI also urges the SEC to maintain the existing fiduciary duty standard for investment advisors.In its February letter, the ICI wrote that the best-interest ""standard would require that a broker-dealer, when making a personalized recommendation about securities to a retail customer, act in the retail customer's best interest and not put the broker-dealer's interests ahead of the customer's interests.""The best-interest standard is a key trait of fiduciary duty.The ICI also calls for a requirement that broker-dealers be barred from recommending a transaction for a retail customer ""that raises a material conflict between the broker-dealer's interests and the customer's interests unless the broker-dealer discloses all material facts about the conflict and obtains the customer's consent.""Andrew Stoltmann, a securities fraud attorney in Chicago, says the SEC appears to be on a path toward adopting a ""disclosure-plus"" standard. ""In other words, a far watered-down version from what the DOL passed in 2016,"" he said.The disclosure that Stoltmann expects would require brokers and investments advisors to provide a relationship summary to retail investors.

1431,KEY,"Hungry for tax-free retirement income? A Roth IRA can provide that. Even if your income is too high to qualify for being able to use a Roth IRA, there's a way around that restriction. And that legal loophole is wider now, thanks to the recent tax reform package. The loophole is known as a backdoor Roth IRA. The tax reform package clarifies that backdoor Roth IRAs are in fact legal.XThis year, the right to contribute to a Roth IRA begins to phase out for joint tax filers whose income is over $189,000. For single filers, the phaseout begins above $120,000. A backdoor Roth IRA gets you around those income restrictions.Taxpayers who had shied away from using backdoor IRAs for fear of running afoul of the IRS now have a clear path to using this strategy to create Roth IRAs — whose key trait is that you can take withdrawals tax-free after five years and after reaching age 59-1/2.""Some people, including many financial advisors, still think it is a gray area, but it isn't,"" said Ed Slott, founder of IRAhelp.com. ""The congressional conference committee report (for the tax reform package) says four times that Congress is OK with people using the backdoor Roth strategy. That's it. You don't need the IRS to say anything because Congress is a higher authority, and it has now spoken.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA Roth IRA's tax-free retirement income is especially enticing if tax rates rise or you end up in a higher rate bracket in retirement.So how does a backdoor Roth IRA work? Instead of starting a Roth IRA directly — which you may not be eligible to do because of the income restrictions — you start and make a nondeductible contribution to a traditional IRA. No income restrictions apply to your right to put money into a traditional IRA this way.Nondeductible means you are using money left over after you pay your income taxes. But the tax impact is a wash. You would not have been allowed to deduct a direct contribution to a Roth IRA anyway. Both are so-called after-tax contributions.After putting the money into a traditional IRA, you convert or transfer it to a Roth IRA. You can shift the money at any time. You can contribute up to $5,500 a year to a traditional IRA, or up to $6,500 if you are age 50 or older.Remember, you'll owe income tax on the conversion amount.That's it. The money grows tax-free inside your Roth IRA. And withdrawals are tax-free after five years and age 59-1/2.IBD'S TAKE: If you are a newcomer to stock investing who wants a few pointers, check out IBD's introduction to stock investing or IBD's mutual funds section for tips and strategies.Still, remember to follow certain rules:But there's a very helpful exception to that rule. ""For married couples filing a joint return, the backdoor Roth IRA can be doubled by have a nonworking spouse also contribute to his or her own IRA,"" Slott said. The working spouse must have enough earned income to cover the contribution for the nonworking spouse. If he's contributing for both spouses, he or she must have earned income in an amount equal to or exceeding the contributions.If you have no other IRAs, the calculation is simple. Better yet, the conversion will be tax-free because the amount converted will consist only of after-tax, nondeductible money.If you have additional traditional IRAs, whether they are funded with deductible or nondeductible contributions, you must include all of your traditional IRA balances in the tax calculation.The crux of the calculation is this: You pay taxes in proportion to the original account's pretax contributions and earnings. Suppose you kick in $6,500 to a nondeductible traditional IRA. In addition, you also have an IRA worth $93,500, funded entirely with deductible contributions. As a result, 93.5% of any conversion would be taxable.Why? You can't convert only after-tax contributions to avoid tax on the conversion.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Retirement Savings: More Americans Than Ever Have $1 Million Or MoreYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

1433,KEY,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) broke past a buy point on heavy volume and hit a record high Wednesday after ""knocking it out of the park once again"" during its first quarter, an analyst said.Shares of Intuitive jumped 8.2% to close at 471.03 on the stock market today. The stock broke out of a consolidation that began forming in late January with a buy point at 452.10. Intuitive also joined Investor's Business Daily's Leaderboard.All signs point to a strong 2018, Canaccord analyst Jason Mills said in a note to clients.""The firm continues to produce best-in-class results in large-cap medtech, knocking it out of the park once again in the first quarter,"" he said. The lion's share of first-quarter metrics ""all handily eclipsed expectations.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut analysts were more split on procedure growth and expectations. During the quarter, the number of procedures using Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System rose about 15%. Intuitive cited growing demand for U.S. general surgery and worldwide urologic procedures.In the U.S., the number of da Vinci procedures performed grew 14%. Growth was 18% for the rest of the world. Intuitive raised the bottom line of its 2018 outlook to 12%-15% growth in procedures. Placement of new da Vinci systems in hospitals also was a highlight, growing 46% year over year.""Ultimately, procedure growth should remain the key focus for investors, as procedure volume growth has historically been a leading indicator of additional system placements,"" Mills said.Intuitive expects it's still in the early innings of the large hernia repair market, Mills said. Hernia and general surgery are expected to be the biggest procedure volume bucket.Whereas Mills sees Intuitive as firing ""on all cylinders,"" Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar notes Intuitive didn't raise the top-end of its 2018 outlook for procedure volume. In 2017, procedures grew by 16%, he said in a note to clients.The question comes down to valuation for Intuitive stock, Kumar said. If hospitals are, in fact, purchasing da Vinci systems in anticipation of future procedure demand, then a lofty price/earnings ratio could be justified.""However, given historical comments that procedures are a leading indicator for system placements, procedures coming in-line with expectations would argue against a greater than 40 times price/earnings ratio on capital expenditures revenue beat,"" he said.Maintaining a high valuation also depends on whether Intuitive can maintain its standing as the predominant player in the market, Kumar said. Auris Health recently launched its Monarch Platform for lung biopsy. At the same time, Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are moving into the robotic surgery market.""Investors are more comfortable paying premium price/earnings ratios for assets perceived as having monopoly power,"" he said. But with other entrants coming, ""one could make a case against the sustenance of this monopoly power.""Bulls may argue that Intuitive has a technological lead on rivals. The debate is likely to come to a head in the next 12 months, Kumar said.In the meantime, Kumar says he is staying on the sidelines. Canaccord's Mills, though upped his price target on Intuitive to 430 from 410, and kept his hold rating.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1446,KEY,"It's easy to say it's always best to be honest. But sometimes it takes guts to be a straight shooter with someone and to show you're vulnerable.Here's how to gather that fortitude to effectively lead your group.Tell the truth. Start with the basics. Honesty really is the best policy, even if it's easier to tell a white lie than to confront someone with the bad news that they're not performing well enough.""If you're not honest, sooner or later it will catch up with you and then it interferes with building trust,"" said Linda Finkle, founder and CEO of Washington, D.C.-based business coaching and consulting firm Incedo Group.Admit mistakes.Famed investor Warren Buffett wins trust because he's open about his missteps, says Constance Dierickx, Atlanta-based advisor to boards and senior executives and author of ""High-Stakes Leadership."" Each year, Buffett summarizes where he and his firm went wrong with their investments. Dierickx at times calls back clients a day or two after giving them advice and tells them after thinking about it further she has a different recommendation.""People will know you're honest and they can trust you,"" Dierickx told IBD.Help others. Finkle once had to let someone go for performance reasons. Years later the woman thanked Finkle, saying it showed her where she needed to improve.""If our goal as a leader is to be in service to people, then it's important to tell the truth, whether it's something the person wants to hear or not,"" Finkle said.Seek support.When you're breaking bad news to people, you have to muster the guts to tell them. But don't feel as if you have to go it alone. Dierickx says she'll often advise clients to go public about a problem even if their lawyers tell them to do the opposite. They're usually better off being open about it. Home Depot (HD) CEO Frank Blake was upfront in 2014 when a data breach exposed more than 50 million payment cards. He admitted the problem, said customers wouldn't be harmed, devoted resources to the matter and published a letter of apology.""Companies have to protect their image, but it has to be subordinate to being honest,"" Dierickx said.Develop fortitude. Dierickx says you can build up your ability to steel yourself and deliver bad news. She views it as a combination of vision and mission to show your belief in what you're doing. Toss in persistence, and the combination will get you to face the toughest conversations. Your character is the great multiplier.""If you don't have character, the other stuff doesn't make any difference,"" Dierickx said.Get advice. Some people don't know how to have brutally honest conversations. Ask others how to handle it.""It doesn't make you less of a leader because you need to ask for help,"" Finkle said. ""Even Olympic athletes have coaches.""Be open. If you're uncomfortable with the discussion, tell the person you're talking to that you might not be the best at this. Then work your way through it. It'll get easier.""Talk about it in a way that's not self-deprecating, but is aimed at, 'How can I get better?' "" Finkle said.Keep improving. Others will trust you if you don't appear to be a know-it-all. Show people you're always learning. Dierickx once worked at a company that had a ""belly flop"" award. People talked in a meeting about something that went off the rails and what they learned from it.""I have more credibility if I show that I'm learning,"" Dierickx said.Stay true to yourself. The key to breaking bad news is to be genuine, Finkle says. If the company has to lay off a batch of people, admit it's painful rather than putting up a false front.""People respond to genuine humanness,"" Finkle said.

1448,KEY,"Stock market futures edged lower for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100, with chip stocks coming under pressure for a second session.

One premarket winner is Amazon.com (AMZN), which revealed that it has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members.Customers pay Amazon and Netflix (NFLX) real money for their services. Meanwhile, fellow FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have offered free services in which users pay in ""data."" But that free-data, ad-driven model has come under fire in the wake of the Facebook data-privacy scandal. This divide is stark in the FANG stocks' performance.(Apple (AAPL), which is sometimes included in a FAANG stock grouping, is a more extreme example of the dollars-vs.-data model. Apple gets customers — and wireless providers — to pay up for the iPhone, while stressing privacy and not selling users' data.)S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%. Dow Jones futures were just below break-even.Amazon has vaulted 69% over the past year to Wednesday's close.

Late Wednesday, CEO Jeff Bezos disclosed Amazon Prime membership has topped 100 million, the first time the company disclosed any specific figures for Prime users.

The stock sold off sharply in late March on revelations that Cambridge Analytica had unauthorized data on some 87 million Facebook users. The social giant said third parties have likely scrapped data from most of its two billion users. The stock has recouped some losses, helped by a decent performance by CEO Mark Zuckerberg at congressional hearings. But Facebook shares have been lagging the S&P 500 since Nov. 1.Facebook user growth is slowing, new regulations are likely, and the company is spending more to root out fake news and Russian interference. To make matters worse, Amazon appears to be grabbing a bigger piece of the online ad market, cutting into Facebook and Google.Alphabet shares have climbed 26% in the last 12 months, up slightly in 2018. Facebook's woes hit Alphabet shares somewhat, amid concerns about how regulators might target Google's own data practices. Alphabet's RS line hasn't made much headway in the past year. The stock did retake its 50-day line on Tuesday.As for Apple, the iPhone maker also is up 26% over the past year. The stock is up modestly in 2018, approaching a new 183.60 buy point.

1455,KEY,"Peculiar action in the stock market can seem to make a fool out of the rules.Imagine you've been tracking a stock on your watch list. Then one day the stock moves up in strong volume but stays below the buy point in a handle.If you're a rules-based investor, you're not buying because the stock didn't clear the buy point, not even intraday. You continue to watch the stock.It then inches above the buy point in quiet volume and, over the next few days, pads the gain in low volume.Even more frustrating, the stock might clear the 5% buy zone without finding strong volume, except for that one day when it fell short of the buy point.Did the rule let you down? Or is there something else you failed to recognize? Often in these situations, rigid thinking is the problem. A flexible mind is necessary to investing.When an individual investor sees what looks like breakout action before the stock reaches the conventional buy point, that investor needs to study the chart.The key question is this: Did the stock break above a trend line on the day when price and volume came into the stock?Sometimes a downward-sloping trend line can be drawn from the left side high to the handle. If the stock crosses above the trend line in strong volume, the action constitutes an early entry. In some cases, it just might be the only entry you will see.Even if the stock breaks out at the standard buy point, looking for the alternative entry can be useful. If it gets you in the stock a bit early, you are better positioned to sit through minor turbulence.The 8% loss-cutting sell rule may get those who bought at the standard buy point but never reach the early entry.There's another benefit to the early entry. The question of whether you should act on the early entry or wait for the standard entry is useful in itself. Ask yourself these two questions: How much conviction do I have in this market? How much conviction do I have in this stock?If stock action forces you to answer the question, it's a good thing.In October 2014, Mobileye began consolidating after a run-up following its initial public offering.The stock corrected 46%, which was deep but somewhat less of a concern because initial public offerings tend to be more volatile than a more mature stock.Mobileye, which used to trade under the ticker symbol ""MBLY"" before getting acquired by Intel (INTC), began climbing the right side of the base in March. In May, the stock began sketching a handle. The handle had a textbook quality: lower lows, quiet volume.Investors looking for an aggressive entry could've drawn a trend line from the left side high to the high of the handle. This identified a buy point around 46.75.On June 9, Mobileye cleared the trend line (1) in volume 104% above average. Two sessions later, the stock broke past the conventional entry at 48.88 (2).About 10 weeks later, the aggressive investor had a 38% gain, while those who waited for the standard entry had a 32% gain. The difference wasn't huge, but in investing, you take every edge you can get.(A version of this column was first published in the Dec. 3, 2015, print edition of IBD. Mobileye was acquired by Intel in August 2017.

1462,KEY,"A day before April 20, when a dome of pot fumes will account for approximately 90% of the smog over Los Angeles and its hot marijuana business, Big Tobacco stocks giants Altria Group (MO), sister firm Philip Morris International (PM) and British American Tobacco (BTI) tanked on fresh signs of declining demand.The reason was that Philip Morris, which sells outside the U.S., fell short of Q1 sales expectations, amid an ongoing consumer flight from cigarettes in most of the world. Weaker-than-anticipated demand for reduced-risk devices that aren't cigarettes, particularly in Japan, also hurt.One place where none of this is a problem, at least right now, is the rapidly growing, quasi-legal marijuana business. More users, perhaps accepting that they don't enjoy coughing or pot smoke's armpit-spice smell, are turning to vaping devices. Some analysts say that trend could be an opportunity for firms like Altria and Turning Point Brands (TPB), which owns rolling-paper-maker Zig Zag and two vaping companies.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, Big Tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShe estimated then that Big Tobacco companies could nearly double their underlying growth via cannabis. Overall, assuming full legalization, Big Tobacco could scoop up around a fifth of the overall share of the marijuana business by 2036, she said in a report then.The marijuana delivery platform Eaze said last year that ready-to-use products, which include vaping devices, for the first time made up a greater portion of its sales than ""flower,"" the industry's term for buds. Vaporizers in November and December made up a greater percentage of sales than dry, loose buds, according to data from the company, which operates in California. ""Not a lot of people know how to roll a joint, or they don't have the paraphernalia to consume the flower,"" Sheena Shiravi, Eaze's director of communications. ""So (with) prerolls, they can just consume flower, or even better, a vaporizer.""Even so, people do, in fact, still roll joints. Turning Point Brands said in March that ""there will be a whole new audience of consumers"" of people rolling their own in Canada, where recreational pot legalization kicks in this year. Turning Point Brands at that time said it widened its offering of its Zig Zag Orange and King-Size Slim rolling papers in Canada, and that its partners were ""exploring additional opportunity products"" beyond this year.At a conference in January, Turning Point Brands CEO Larry Wexler said that it saw the marijuana business as an ""exciting opportunity"" that it was still trying to understand. He added: ""I suspect that there probably are some people who buy our products that were intended for tobacco — my lawyer's sitting here — intended for tobacco and they go off and they credibly use it for other products.""Even as it remains enthusiastic about the marijuana business, Turning Point Brands said in January that it had no plans for any prerolled products. Azer suggested that tobacco companies pushing lower-health-risk products might not want the extra glare from regulators that could come with trying to sell their own joints.""The tobacco industry is highly scrutinized and highly regulated,"" she said. ""And that's true in the U.S. and it's true globally as well. Right now, one of the key priorities for global tobacco companies are their reduced-risk product platforms.""The marijuana business, however, has its own big health problems. In California, new cannabis industry regulations on pesticides take hold in July. Those rules have raised fears that the vast majority of the pot sold via dispensaries would come up short, choking off supply and pushing prices higher. The changes would likely favor the state's small portion of licensed, deeper-pocketed pot growers.Despite the marijuana industry's rebranding efforts — the rustic-chic packaging and the chipper, minimalist startup logos — a lot of pot is still loaded with chemicals that are bad for you, a Rolling Stone article from March notes. That story also notes that because marijuana is illegal on a federal level, the EPA hasn't approved or rejected what pesticides to use for pot the way it does for other plants.Meanwhile, other tobacco companies have made quieter moves that may, or may not, signal interest in the marijuana business. Philip Morris International planned to invest roughly $20 million in Syqe Medical, an Israeli company that makes a cannabis inhaler, according to reports in 2016. Syqe ""will develop technologies for Phillip Morris that will help reduce health risks associated with smoking,"" Reuters said, citing the Israeli news outlet Calcalist. Philip Morris declined to provide any extra information beyond existing press accounts. The overseas Big Tobacco firm said it ""has no plans to develop or commercialize cannabis products."" Similarly, Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA and spun off Philip Morris International a decade ago, said ""Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and Altria's companies have no plans to sell marijuana-based products.""Imperial Brands (IMBBY), the U.K. company whose brands include cigarettes like Winston and Kool, last year appointed Simon Langelier to its board. Langelier is a 30-year Philip Morris International veteran who is also chairman of a medical cannabis company. Imperial, in a release, cited his experience in ""wider consumer adjacencies.""When asked about how Imperial was viewing the cannabis market, Simon Evans, a spokesman for the company, said it is ""tracking developments in what is a fast-growing segment."" Evans stressed that Langelier's experience at Philip Morris was the main reason for his appointment. But Evans indicated his cannabis industry experience wasn't just an afterthought. ""So, is it irrelevant? No. It's not,"" he said.  YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Will Marijuana Industry Overtake Beer As Legalization Spurs Innovation?These Marijuana Stocks With Second-Hand Exposure May Surprise YouThe Apple Store For Weed Partners With Nasdaq's First Pot StockBeer Giant To Take More Active Role In Cannabis, Boost Pot SpendingLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1464,KEY,"Taxes: There's a growing disconnect between the economic benefits spinning off the Republican tax cuts and the poll numbers. Is the public going sour of them? Or is this just more wishful thinking on the part of Democrats and the liberal press?Just the past week saw three more examples of the tax cuts' benefits.Item 1: Kroger announced that it was accelerating wage hikes, increasing the company's 401(k) match, enhancing benefits, and expanding employee discounts. All, it said, thanks to the Republican tax reforms. Kroger joins more than 500 other companies who've extended bonuses, wage hikes, or improved benefits to more than 4 million workers in the wake of the law's sharp reduction in corporate tax rates.Item 2: A Gallup poll found that the public thinks the tax code is more fair today than it was before the Republican tax cuts took effect. Just 42% now say middle income families pay too much in income taxes, down from 51% last year. And 26% say upper-income families pay their fair share, up from 24% last year. What's more, nearly a quarter (24%) say that corporations pay their fair share, up from 19% a year ago. These results are startling, given that Democrats have spent months claiming the tax cuts were nothing but a giveaway to corporations and the rich.Item 3: The Congressional Budget Office sharply increased its forecast for GDP growth this year as a result of the tax cuts — raising it from 2% to 3.3%. It expects GDP growth next year to be 2.4%, up from 1.5% before the tax cuts took effect. This extra growth will end up paying for most of the cost of the tax cuts, the CBO says.Yet despite continued good news about the tax cuts — and the economy in general — several polls show tax-cut support softening. Just 27% say the tax cuts are a good idea, down from 30% in January, according to the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. The Quinnipiac Poll has approval at 36%, down from 39% in February. The Monmouth poll shows support at 41%, where it was 44% in January. And while 48% back the tax cuts in the latest New York Times' poll, support was 51% in February.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThis slippage is music to Democrats' ears and, according to the Washington Examiner, is ""alarming Republicans counting on the law to save the party's vulnerable House majority.""The Examiner says Republicans are privately grumbling that President Trump dropped the ball on promoting the tax cuts in recent weeks, shifting his focus instead to tariffs and immigration. It quotes Ohio Rep. Steve Stivers, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, who said, ""People aren't talking about it enough, and when people aren't talking about it enough, that's a problem.""There's no doubt some truth to this. Support for the tax cuts went up amid daily reports of worker bonuses and bigger paychecks. But as that news subsided, support drifted. The GOP's cave-in on spending, and the resulting increases in deficits, have no doubt also affected the polls.Trump hasn't helped matters much, either. He recently went to West Virginia for an event billed as about his tax plan, but he tossed his prepared remarks — calling them ""boring"" — and spent most of his time going on about trade, border security and other topics.This PR vacuum has let Democrats — with the aid and comfort of a hopelessly biased news media — continue to peddle their blatant falsehoods about taxes without sufficient opposition.Even so, the claim that the tax cuts are increasingly unpopular, or that this poses a political risk for Republicans, should be taken with a very large grain of salt.As we've pointed out in this space on numerous occasions, when described as ""the Republican tax cuts"" — as most surveys do — they tended to poll badly. But whenever pollsters asked about actual specifics in the tax bill, support sharply rose.What's more, the Gallup findings make it clear that the Democrats' attempt to demonize the tax cuts as unfair to the middle class have utterly failed. And their promises to raise taxes the first chance they get aren't likely to sway many voters.Whatever the polls say today, Republicans have a winning message for the November midterms: The tax cuts aren't just letting Americans keep more of their money. They are a key part of the GOP's pro-growth strategy, which is already producing a stronger economy, creating more jobs, and providing more opportunity.Republicans just need to proclaim it, early and often and with pride.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:It's Official: Trump Tax Cuts Are Boosting Growth And Mostly Paying For ThemselvesDems Vow To Repeal 'Parts' Of GOP Tax Cuts; But Which Ones?

1465,KEY,"Ford Motor (F) reportedly plans to operate its own self-driving-car network on a large scale by 2021 to transport people and goods.XRather than sell its technology to a ride-hailing operator, the No. 2 U.S. carmaker will operate a network of custom-built autonomous vehicles itself, Jim Farley, Ford's global markets president, told the Financial Times in an interview in London.That would align Ford's plans with those of General Motors (GM) and Renault-Nissan (NSANY), which plan to run their own self-driving fleets, vs. the likes of Volvo and Tata Motors' (TTM) Jaguar Land Rover, which plan to sell driverless vehicles to ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Waymo, the Times noted.GM plans a large-scale launch of its robotaxis next year, while Nissan plans to launch its service, called Easy Ride, in the early 2020s.""The key message from Ford is we're not looking just to start then (in 2021),"" Farley said. ""We're setting up the Miami business model now so that we can scale then.""Ford's service also will have key difference with GM, the Times noted. It will use a new vehicle powered by hybrid technology and also will carry people and cargo interchangeably, suggesting a larger vehicle such as a Transit van. GM will use a version of its Chevrolet Bolt EV hatchback.""One of the most important parts of the test is the business model itself,"" Farley said, to establish how revenue is split, how much consumers will pay for a self-driving delivery, and at what price the service is useful to customers such as logistics or delivery companies. Ford also plans to open its network to local small businesses to transport goods, taking on rivalry local courier services.Ford announced in 2016 it would launch a so-called robotaxi service by 2021; last year it bought Argo AI, an artificial-intelligence firm, for $1 billion to take on General Motors and Waymo in developing self-driving cars. And Ford in February declared it was ""headed to Florida to test and prove out our business model"" by using self-driving technology for pizza deliveries in a pact with Domino's Pizza (DPZ).Shares of Ford closed up 0.9% at 11.38 on the stock market today.

1466,KEY,"IBM (IBM) reported quarterly results late Tuesday, and once again it was time for stock market analysts to agonize over IBM's performance.Big Blue topped views on earnings and revenue, but it wasn't good enough to convince the Street. The stock gapped down sharply in huge volume.Gap downs on quarterly results are nothing new to IBM.In four of the past five quarterly reports including Tuesday's, IBM gapped down on results. And in the one case when the stock gapped up, the stock gave back the gains over the next several weeks.Yet, investors well-grounded in history know that this too shall pass.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLet's look at a number of factors surrounding IBM.History: For six years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, IBM stock was stuck in the mud. From August 1987 to July 1993, the stock price declined 77%. Those investors old enough to have lived through that period can only shake their heads at the kid analysts panicking. Challenges are rarely new and always take time to overcome.The honk surrounding IBM's stock decline in 1987-93 was mainly because of changing technology. Personal computers were shifting the technology from the big to the little. IBM's success on the big side became a handicap in a newer and more versatile world.How did IBM survive?New leadership: Louis Gerstner was named CEO on April 1, 1993. Gerstner ran the show until March 1, 2002, when he stepped down. During Gerstner's nine-year reign as CEO, IBM's stock rose  671% vs. 151% for the Nasdaq and 148% for the S&P 500, according to IBD sister company William O'Neil + Co. (Those figures do not include dividends.)Does IBM need new leadership now? The stock market seems to think so. Ginni Rometty became CEO on Jan. 1, 2012. Since then, the stock has fallen about 12%. How bad is that? The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 rose 179% and 115% in the same period.Is it Rometty's fault? Probably not, but CEOs are like field managers in baseball. Fair or unfair, they are hired to be fired when the team disappoints.There is one area, however, where IBM has not disappointed.Dividends: The quarterly dividend payout is $1.50 a share, which calculates to a 4% annualized yield. IBM's 4% yield is the second-highest yield in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average. (Verizon is No. 1 with a 4.8% yield.)IBM has increased its dividend for 22 years in a row. Dividend increases are usually announced in late April. Look for that streak to rise to 23 years in a row for three reasons.First, IBM's cash flow per share was $18.46 in 2017, which  easily covers any increase in the $6 a share dividend. Second, no CEO wants to be associated with an end to the dividend-increasing streak. Third, IBM is closing in on the minimum criteria to earn a spot in the Dividend Aristocrats lineup. The minimum criteria is 25 years of consecutive dividend increases.Is IBM a buy? From a growth-stock perspective, heck no. But income investors might regard the chart differently.The stock chart: The monthly chart is the best way to view IBM now. From April 2013 to mid-February 2016, IBM fell about 45%. Over the next 12 to 13 months, the stock rebounded 56% above the low. As of Wednesday afternoon, IBM was about 28% above the mid-February low.Income investors might want to watch the price area from 139 to 147. This is where the stock has found recent support.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) has reduced its stake in IBM to almost nothing. Could Buffett be wrong? Some A+ rated funds seem to think so.Twelve funds with A+ ratings from IBD reduced exposure to IBM in Q1. But 12 other A+ funds either increased or held steady their positions.Alex Gunz, a fund manager at Heptagon Capital, is one of the few making a bullish case for IBM.In a January appearance on CNBC, Gunz said IBM's turnaround is taking it out of commoditized spaces. IBM's growth is in what the company calls ""strategic imperatives,"" which include the cloud and blockchain. Gunz said the change can't be expected to ""happen overnight."" He said that progress will be more of a ""one to two year view.""A Heptagon Capital report in January noted that IBM is gaining exposure to blockchain technology. Blockchain is the technology underneath bitcoin, and it is expected to be ""both radical and transformative."" According to the report, blockchain technology is ""where the internet was 20 years ago.""The  report added that, ""Among the major players, IBM and Microsoft appear currently to have taken a lead.""RELATED:Here's Why IBM Stock Fell Despite Its First-Quarter Earnings BeatDow Stocks Breaking Out Or Threatening ToTextron's Breakout 'Long Overdue'3 Elements That Can Reveal Much About A Company

1469,KEY,"Before Larry Kudlow took his place as the president's top economic advisor, Vanity Fair attacked. Apparently Kudlow failed to predict the 2008 economic crisis.If that's the worst charge against him, it's one that applies to nearly every economist. What's really underlying Vanity Fair's sneer is the fact that Kudlow isn't a PhD economist. He's an economist by trade — meaning he has a firm foundation in the real world.Today's academic economists are paid to be wrong. Ruchir Sharma, Morgan Stanley chief global strategist, recently asked how often the ivory tower is incorrect. His answer? Always.Certainly Jason Furman was wrong in 2014 when he predicted a resurgence in growth. Furman, who was then serving in the White House, was part of a group that predicted 3.1% growth in 2014 (actual reading: 2.6%) and 3.5% in 2015 (reality: 2.9%).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThese academics are wrong so often because the world is changing too rapidly for historical analyses to apply. Even five years ago, no economist could imagine construction companies would use drones to monitor and protect their projects.That's happening now. Ancient sectors like manufacturing and construction are deploying, and yes developing, technology to revolutionize how we build. That revolution will impact prices, wages, and growth in ways we cannot yet fully understand.It's time to tear up the old models.There's another reason to be skeptical. As UK-based analyst Ann Pettifor has argued, academic economists today are driven by ideology, not science. They'll dismiss basic math if it indicates growth will result from a policy they don't like.Take Paul Krugman, a leading critic of our free enterprise system.Krugman apparently doesn't believe there's a U.S. labor shortage. He's said, ""Whenever you see some business person quoted complaining about how he or she can't find workers with the necessary skills, ask what wage they're offering.""Mr. Krugman: employers in homebuilding, manufacturing, retail, and agriculture can't even get people through our doors to apply. Negotiating salaries with ghosts is impossible. Even Jason Furman knows demographic trends are weighted against us.Construction firms around the country are turning away millions in contracted business due to lack of workers. Executives don't turn down work just to keep wages low. (That is basic math.) As I have written before, conscious capitalists want to promote new talent. We know we must reward employees if we want to keep them and grow our businesses. There are bad actors in corporate America, but these few haven't spoiled the free enterprise system.Krugman is a Nobel prize-winning economist, but he's also a columnist. He gets paid to opine. Policymakers who listen to him can't forget that.Krugman, of course, isn't the only economist ideologue. The ivory tower is all over the place when it comes to policy, from tariffs to taxes.Last fall, 137 economists issued a letter supporting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TJCA). A University of Chicago survey of economists, meanwhile, found only one of  42 thought the TJCA would boost growth. Economists are notorious for arguing both sides of an issue. President Ronald Reagan quipped that an economists' version of Trivial Pursuit would have 100 questions and 3,000 answers.Larry Kudlow will keep one foot in reality — with the men and women who drive America forward, whether it's through their strategic vision or their work ethic. I encourage Kudlow to form sector-specific working groups that will bring forward CEOs, small business owners, and American workers to discuss the practical problems facing their industries today.Kudlow believes in American entrepreneurship and growth. He and I both believe that, with the right policies, growth can hit four or five percent. He's an advocate for expansion economics and many of its key pillars — lower taxes, less regulation, fair trade, public-private cooperation in infrastructure development, and immigration reform.Thank goodness the president didn't take his personnel cues from Vanity Fair, but in today's world, it would benefit the White House's top economic advisor — and all Washington policymakers — to hear more from men and women in the trenches of American business. It's the only way they'll be able to predict where this economy is going.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1474,KEY,"Heron Pharmaceuticals (HRTX) catapulted to a three-year high Monday after its post-surgical pain drug outperformed a component used in a rival drug from Pacira Pharmaceuticals (PCRX) in a pair of head-to-head tests.On the stock market today, Heron rocketed 27% to close at 27.30, hitting its highest point since September 2015. Shares of Pacira toppled nearly 10% on the news at one point, but ended the day down 0.7% to 30.68.The trial pitted Heron's drug HTX-011 and bupivacaine, a component of Pacira's already-approved Exparel in patients who had either had a bunion removed or a hernia repaired. In both cases, HTX-011 was superior to a placebo and bupivacaine, Heron said in a news release.Needham analyst Serge Belanger says the data likely support a broad label for HTX-011 if approved. HTX-011 also cut down on the number of patients needing opioids to curb their pain.""Heron believes the data supports an opioid-sparing label, which would be a significant game-changer,"" Belanger said in a note to clients. He raised his price target on Heron to 42 from 30, and kept his buy rating.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHTX-011 cut pain through 72 hours following surgery by 27% and 23%, respectively, vs. a placebo in bunion and hernia patients. On the same measure vs. bupivacaine, HTX-011 reduced pain by 18% and 21%, respectively.Among bunion patients, 29% required no opioids for 72 hours following surgery vs. 2% and 11% of patients on a placebo and bupivacaine, respectively. Of hernia patients, 51% didn't need opioids for pain management vs. 22% and 40% of placebo- and bupivacaine-receiving patients.""Overall, the Phase 3 data confirm prior results seen in three Phase 2 trials where HTX-011 was superior to placebo and (bupivacaine) on both pain relief and opioid consumption,"" Belanger said.In late 2018, Heron plans to report data from two Phase 2 trials of HTX-011 in pain relief for patients after knee replacement surgery and following breast augmentation, he said. The data are expected to be part of Heron's application for approval of HTX-011.""There are an estimated 300 million surgical procedures in the U.S. on an annual basis that require postoperative pain management,"" Belanger said.HTX-011 is poised to be a ""major player"" in that industry. Exparel currently holds about 3% of the market and generates around $300 million in annual sales, he said.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said Heron will likely seek a similar reimbursement strategy for HTX-011 as Exparel.The announcement is the last of the near-term overhangs on Pacira, she said in a report to clients. But Pacira is unlikely to rebound as investors look for HTX-011 to enter the market and amid the declining potential that Dow Jones stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) will buy Pacira.Still, Exparel has some advantage being earlier to the market than HTX-011.""Exparel has been approved since October 2011 and is extremely familiar to hospitals and surgeons,"" she said. ""The government is likely to approve policies that incentivize usage of opioid alternatives, so reimbursement could become more favorable and further increase utilization.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With HandleLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1475,KEY,"Dividend stocks come in all shapes and sizes. And seasons.The name CF Industries (CF) recently cropped up on IBD's Dividend Leaders list, just as Corn Belt farmers should be rolling into their spring planting season. This year's weather has been uncooperative, however, keeping farmers from their fields by spreading snow, rain and heavy winds from the Gulf Coast through the Midwest.Still, analyst consensus projects the equivalent of a 476% rebound in CF's EPS to 94 cents a share this year, followed by an 85% gain in 2019 to $1.74. CF lost 25 cents a share in 2017. The Deerfield, Ill., company exited nine quarters of earnings declines in the fourth quarter. Its Q1 EPS is forecast to rise 400%.The stock's chart is not pretty. Its price has slipped 9% since the start of the year. Shares are just climbing off support at their 40-week moving average. They could be building a base, but have got a ways to go. And the stock's dragging relative strength line is not what you want to see, even from dividend stocks.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd yet CF may be worth putting on your radar. Some analysts project that the entire fertilizer industry is set for a cyclical upturn. Two of the industry's largest names, Potash Saskatchewan and Agrium, combined in January to form Nutrien (NTR). The merger tightened competition and provided the industry added control over manufacturing and supply. Consensus estimates expect Nutrien's earnings to soar 420% this year and 27% in 2019.Susquehanna Financial group trimmed its earnings outlook for CF Industries in late March, as bad weather pointed to delays in purchases of nitrogen fertilizer. Susquehanna also dropped the stock's 12-month price target to 50 from 54. The target is still more than 30% above where the stock traded on Monday.CF currently pays a 30-cent quarterly dividend per share, so the stock yields 3.1% annually. The company paid down $1.1 billion of high-interest debt at the end of 2017. Analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group project the company will pay down an additional $500 million in debt this year.Next to flashy tech and big defense names, fertilizers seem like a sleepy little sideline industry. But the stocks wowed investors with a collective run-up of more than 1,100% from 2002 to 2008. The group crashed along with the market, then ran up an additional 316% from 2008 to 2013.The Potash/Agrium merger left CF, Mosaic (MOS) and Nutrien as the leading publicly traded players in a vast and vitally important industry. Only CF and Nutrien are dividend stocks. But all of the stocks in the group vary according to several factors. One is the price of corn and soybeans. Two of the most widely planted North American crops, they also require the most intensive use of fertilizers.But the trade tiff between the U.S. and China have left corn prices uncertain, to say the least. Prices on Monday were up 8%. That sounds OK, but it is also 11% below corn's high from last July.Another factor: crude oil prices. The use of corn-based ethanol as an extender for U.S. gasoline supplies has kept corn and oil prices fairly closely related. It has also typically made fertilizer stocks an aggressive way to tap oil price gains.Between August 2006 and June 2008, for example, the stocks in IBD's Chemicals-Agricultural industry group staged a massive 453% rally. That corresponded precisely to a 155% run-up in U.S. oil prices during that same period.In addition, other factors amplified the 2008 fertilizer rally. For one, phosphorus rock was in comparatively short supply. Today, the links between fertilizer stocks and oil prices are somewhat weakened.As a group, fertilizer stocks on Monday traded up 24% from a June 2017 low. Crude oil prices climbed 60% during that same period.At the same time, the price of natural gas fell 10%. And nitrogen production capacity is now in relatively tight supply. Analysts project that this combination of tight supply, low raw-material costs and recovering demand is ultimately going to play in strong favor of the big fertilizer names.Susquehanna's March 28 note said the analysts remained ""positive on the nitrogen cycle."" The analysts continue to expect a multiyear up cycle ""due to lagging global capacity growth that should be outpaced by even modest demand growth.""CF's five-year dividend growth rate is 31%, although it has not raised its payout since August 2014.RELATED:Why You Want To Pay Attention To These Earnings Reports Oracle Chief Tells Trump Pentagon Cloud Plan Makes 'No Sense' Apple, Intel Lead Five Tech Titans That Just Carved This Bullish Pattern

1478,KEY,"Clients hire an advisor to focus on their money. But some advisors take a broader view.Increasingly, health and wellness play a central role as advisors collaborate with clients on formulating a comprehensive, long-term financial plan. Issues related to diet, smoking and stress enter into their discussions.Advisors who gently prod clients to adopt healthier habits strengthen their relationship and produce added value. For example, they might persuade individuals to take steps to reduce risk factors that threaten their longevity.""If I think a client is responsive, I'll give them information on how they can make healthier choices,"" said Susan Pack, a certified financial planner in Cincinnati. ""They see that I'm interested in their entire well-being.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePart of the reason for advisors' interest in a client's health reflects surging medical costs. Health care spending will rise at an average annual rate of 5.5% from 2017 to 2026, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Prescription drugs will rise on average 6.3% a year, potentially blowing a hole in the budget of all but the highest-income earners.On a more personal level, clients appreciate advisors who look beyond dollars and cents to assess the whole person. They're more apt to rave to friends that their advisor doesn't just manage money, but really cares about keeping them happy and healthy.""It's a huge part of what we should be doing as financial planners,"" said Bridget Grimes, a certified financial planner in San Diego. ""For all we do, it's for nothing if someone isn't healthy.""Experienced advisors broach health and wellness issues with clients without lecturing them or making them uncomfortable. They know that criticizing a client's weight or sedentary lifestyle might trigger defensiveness, so they find creative, nonthreatening ways to convey their concern.For about eight years, Grimes has hosted a speaker series devoted to health and wellness. She holds each bimonthly session in a conference room overlooking San Diego Bay that fits 12 people.She limits the size because she wants attendees to interact with the speaker. Because most of her clients are female executives, she chooses topics relevant to them such as the effects of hormones and meditation as a stress reliever.""We tell speakers to give actionable advice that a client can implement incrementally,"" Grimes said. ""We don't pay speakers and they do not pitch their services. Since (attendees) are all busy professionals, we want them to take away a few action steps that they can manage for better quality of life.""Grimes sometimes receives emails from clients who describe how they've applied what they learned. She also writes a blog that summarizes key points from each session for those who do not attend.Another tactic that advisors use to convince clients to lead healthier lives centers on cost savings. Rather than scold people for making poor choices, they may crunch the numbers and let clients draw their own conclusions.Marguerita Cheng, a certified financial planner in Gaithersburg, Md., recalls helping a couple in their 30s purchase term life insurance. In completing the application, she learned that they were social smokers. Comparing the premium, she showed them that they'd save $87 a month if they were nonsmokers.""They bought the insurance at the higher rate, but they vowed to quit over the next year to qualify for the preferred, non-nicotine rate,"" she said. ""I never nagged them. It wasn't about shaming. But they did say, 'This is our motivation to quit.' And they did.""Because advisors often work with clients to craft a budget, they can signal the importance of good health by approving certain purchases. For instance, Cheng may tell clients, ""I want you to eat healthy, and it can cost more to eat right!""If they want to join a CSA (community supported agriculture) run by a local farmer, she gives an enthusiastic thumbs-up. If they're weighing whether to buy salmon or other nutritious but pricey food, she assures them it's fine.""I tell them I won't micromanage where they shop,"" she said. ""But I'll validate it and put it in their budget.""Similarly, Pack often assures clients that they can afford organic foods, yoga classes and other investments in their health.""Some people need permission to spend money on themselves,"" she said. ""I tell them we're building those expenses into their plan.""A longtime vegetarian, Pack doesn't preach to clients. But if the topic arises, she might send them links to information on toxic chemicals in foods.""When people know the why and the reward, then they don't feel selfish spending extra money on organic food,"" Pack said.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:How Advisors Turn Clients' Tax Anxiety Into Smart PlanningAdvisors Learn Lasting Lessons From Their Favorite Business BooksAdvisors Take Smart Steps To Engage Women In The Planning Process

1487,KEY,"Major indexes, after catching their breath on Tuesday, struggled to hold on to early mild gains in Wednesday-morning trading and fell broadly. Meanwhile, leading leisure-sector play China Lodging (HTHT) got burned with big losses after reporting solid results, but still has the opportunity to form a new base.Among stocks in the 30-member Dow Jones industrial average, at least four members dropped 1 point or more, including industrial heavyweights Boeing (BA)and United Technologies (UTX). Boeing dropped 13.29 points, or nearly 4%, and undercut its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover.Boeing's big decline represents the first time the Dow Jones industrial component dropped below the medium-term support level since breaking out of a flat base at 185.81 in May 2017, and thus serves as a sell signal. Holders can consider taking at least partial profits. However, those with a very big profit cushion in Boeing can decide to sit tight and see if the stock does one or both of these two things: 1) form a constructive new base, such as a cup with handle, flat base or double bottom; or 2) find institutional buying support at or near the 50-day line or the longer-term 200-day moving average.Boeing has solid profit estimates from Wall Street (up 17% to $14.07 a share in 2018, up 19% in 2019), and the aerospace giant has halted a four-quarter slump in the top line as sales gained 2% and 9% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters.But some observers on Wall Street are watching closely for any signs of retaliatory measures that America's trading partners may take against key U.S. products, which could include aircraft.United Tech (the aircraft engine, elevator and security systems manufacturer) is forming a new base after breaking out of a saucer with handle at 123.38 on Dec. 11 and gaining as much as 13% before its latest correction.At 11:30 a.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite slumped 0.4% after opening with a gain of nearly 0.4%. The S&P 500 sank more than 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1%. Volume is running higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday.Soft U.S. retail sales for February (down 0.1%, vs. the Econoday forecast for a 0.4% pickup) did not initially spur widespread selling. But investors are expressing concerns over the impact that new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum may have on global trade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs noted in The Big Picture column, the major indexes on Tuesday logged a fresh distribution day, or bout of intense professional selling, as the Nasdaq fell 1% in higher volume vs. the prior session. The S&P 500 dropped 0.6% as NYSE turnover edged higher. But with most leading stocks acting all right and the two key indexes now having retaken their respective 50-day moving averages, the market's current outlook remains at ""confirmed uptrend"" for now.Steel makers haven't made much headway in the wake of historic tariffs of 25% set on steel imports by President Trump, although the White House has set exemptions for Canada and Mexico amid three-party talks to rethink the Nafta trade treaty. However, the highly rated members of the group are generally holding up and are beating the S&P 500.U.S. Steel (X) fell more than 2% and is headed for a fifth down day in a row. Watch to see if institutional buying support can prevent a severe undercut of the stock's rising 50-day moving average.U.S. Steel holds a 92 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. Shares are up 13% since Jan. 1, beating a 3.3% lift by the S&P 500.Wall Street expects U.S. Steel, which has a $7 billion market value and is thus a midcap firm, to increase earnings by 98% this year to $3.84 a share, then boost earnings by 17% in 2019 to $4.50.Tenaris (TS), part of IBD Leaderboard, and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are also group leaders, rising mildly after successful tests of support at their 50-day moving averages.Tenaris is slightly below a 36.43 buy point in a long, deep cup with handle.This week's pullback looks normal so far, given that Tenaris has rallied nicely for four weeks in a row.Notice on a MarketSmith weekly chart how in the week ended Feb. 9, while IBD's current outlook shifted to ""market in correction"" in The Big Picture column, Tenaris respected its 40-week line. That's bullish.The Street sees the expert in oil and gas well steel pipes increasing earnings 43% to $1.10 a share this year and 47% in 2019.Meanwhile, China Lodging (HTHT) dropped more than 10% to 131.70 in heavy turnover and gave back all of its year-to-date gains and then some. But the stock is trying to hold near the 130 level, where it found institutional buying support during the early February market sell-off. The stock is also trading above its long-term 200-day moving average for now.The hotel chain operator late on Tuesday notched an 86% jump in Q4 profit to 52 cents a share, accelerating from EPS gains of 19% and 58% in the prior two quarters, on a 42% rise in revenue to $340.1 million, the second highest for any quarter.After-tax margin jumped 290 basis points to 11.2%.Through Tuesday's close, China Lodging ranked No. 10 in the IBD 50. Shares had already made a stunning climb, rising more than 400% from a first-stage breakout from a cup without handle at 33.10 during the week ended March 18, 2016.This year, the midcap firm formed a new cup with handle, but it was a late-stage base (meaning the risk of failure was greatly elevated) and the stock hadn't yet broken out ahead of Q4 results.In other markets, crude oil was drifting near break-even after a report showed weekly U.S. inventories rose to 5 million barrels in the week ended March 9. WTI slipped 0.1% to $60.64 a barrel.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell to around 2.83%, off from a Feb. 21 high of around 2.94%.

If a stock breaks below the 50-day line in heavy volume and can't rally back, it's often a signal that buying demand is drying up and the stock's run is ending. Amazon trading volume is running four times above average.Also falling below its 50-day line on Wednesday was Netflix (NFLX), with the stock falling 5% to 285.77. Netflix hit a record high of 333.98 on March 12.Netflix and Amazon are two of the four FANG stocks, the others being Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). Alphabet stock was down 0.2% to 1,005.18. Facebook was up 0.5 to 153.03.The last time Amazon stock fell through its 50-day moving average was in October, but on average volume.The stock then surged 13% on Oct. 27 after reporting third-quarter results that crushed estimates. From that point it rose another 47%, to hit a record high of 1,617 on March 13. Since then, including today's action, Amazon stock is down about 11.5%.Amazon has previously been a target of Trump. In December trump lashed out at the company and the U.S. Postal Service in a tweet, saying it should pay higher fees for package deliveries. In August, Trump attacked the company over taxes and accused it of causing job losses during a time when Amazon was aggressively hiring.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Stock Market Resumes Sell-Off As Amazon, Netflix TumbleAmazon Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart AnalysisWhen To Sell Stocks: Amazon, Facebook, Boeing Triggered This Key Profit-Taking Signal

1507,KEY,"If sales and earnings are a company's bread and butter, then cash flow, profit margins and return on equity are the spices.Those three measurements of financial performance provide a deeper and important layer of stock analysis. They also help you understand if a company can sustain its sales and profit growth rates.Consider return on equity as a gauge of financial efficiency. It basically tells you how well a company is utilizing its shareholders' money and assets in expanding its profitability. IBD calculates it by dividing the most recent annual earnings (excluding special items) by an average of the annual shareholders' equity over the past two years.Studies of winning stocks over history show that 17% is the minimum ROE for any great company. Make that your minimum for any stock you research.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMargins express how much profit a company makes on each dollar of sales, so they're a crucial metric. Generally speaking, the higher the margin, the better the business. If the ROE is poor, check to see if pretax margin is 17% or higher. IBD founder Bill O'Neil has said that solid pretax margin can offset a company's ROE that's under 17%.Pretax margins vary from one industry to another. So look for the companies leading their industries in margins. You can also study margin trends over time. For example, a pattern of shrinking margins can tell you that profit growth may be at risk.Cash flow is one of the purest measurements of business activity, because it excludes extraneous items that can skew profit figures. Even revenue can be misleading, depending on how a company recognizes sales on its books.Among the various types of cash flow, the one that matters most for IBD readers is likely cash flow from operations. This offers a good view at a company's incoming and outgoing cash at any given period. Growth companies should generally have cash flow at least 20% higher than annual EPS.Investors can find these data points at IBD's website and its MarketSmith charting and research service.Return on equity and annual pretax margin are shown on stock quotes and Stock Checkup at Investors.com. Cash flow is in the weekly MarketSmith charts.IBD created the Sales-Margins-ROE (SMR) Rating, which combines those key fundamentals into a comprehensive score. Look for a rating of C or higher.

Unit revenue grew 5%, in line with Delta's own view.For Q2, Delta predicts EPS of $1.80-$2, in line with Zacks consensus for $1.92, with unit revenue up 3%-5% and capacity up 3%-4%.When asked during a conference call with analysts if Delta is still on target for its 2018 EPS guidance of $6.70, CEO Ed Bastian said it was, but that fuel will be the ""wild card.""Oil prices in the $70-per-barrel range were still manageable and could create more disciplined operations elsewhere, Delta said, adding that non-fuel unit costs are also seeing an ""unacceptably high"" rate of growth.More premium seats are a part of Delta's ""backbone"" for growth, President Glen Hauenstein said, adding that the carrier would be adding a lot more of those seats to flights this year.""We will have double digit increases throughout the year in terms of premium seats in the marketplace,"" he said during the call.The premiums on those higher-end fare classes, he said, ranged from 10% to as much as double the average coach fare, depending on the type.""So that's really a key driver for us, and I think I think one of the reasons we were able to post what I would consider superior revenue numbers for the first quarter,"" he said.Delta shares were up 2.9% at 52.98 in the stock market today. American Airlines (AAL) rose 2.6%, United Airlines (UAL), which reports results next week, added 1.9%, and Southwest (LUV) gained 2.7%.

Such a move could strengthen a rival to the U.S. carriers on the international stage.IAG said it had taken a 4.61% stake in Norwegian. That investment, IAG said, ""is intended to establish a position from which to initiate discussions with Norwegian, including the possibility of a full offer for Norwegian."" But it said no discussions have taken place and that there was no guarantee of a deal.When asked about that possible deal during Delta's earnings call, management did not comment on the potential impact.Low-cost, long-haul carriers that fly between the U.S. and Europe have reshaped competition over the Atlantic. But Delta said unit revenue in its trans-Atlantic routes jumped 12% in Q1. International unit revenue overall was helped by solid business demand and demand for its roomier Comfort Plus seating option.On Tuesday, American raised the low end of its unit revenue guidance. It now expects a 3%-4% increase, up from an earlier view for a 2%-4% gain.And late Monday, United forecast a 2.7% gain in Q1 unit revenue, helped, as with Delta, by a pickup in international travel demand. That's near the upper end of its prior target for a 1%-3% gain.JetBlue Airways raised its Q1 unit revenue target on Wednesday. Unit revenue likely climbed 6.1%, above JetBlue's 3.5%-5.5% target.Southwest Airlines cut its Q1 unit revenue outlook in late March.

""T-Mobile had put the synergy number on a merger at around $40 billion in the fall of 2017. We believe the majority of these synergies were around network savings.

It edged up 0.1% following the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes from its March meeting on interest rates. Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF was practically flat.The S&P 500 — weighed down by selling in steel, dairy, building products, construction, auto retail, and medical systems and equipment stocks — fell fractionally. The Dow Jones industrial average fell a little more than 0.4%. Volume was running sharply lower vs. the same time Tuesday on the Nasdaq and modestly lower on the NYSE.A decline in lower volume is favorable the day following a key confirmation of a new potential market uptrend, as flagged by the IBD Big Picture column Tuesday.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond held around 2.79%, up roughly 5 basis points since the end of March.Crude oil futures continued to rally.

Yet a strong bounce off the 50-day moving average would justify holders with a profit cushion in the stock to add a small amount of shares as a follow-on buy. The 50-day line, painted in red in IBD charts, is hovering just under 50.In that base, Micron dropped 25% from high to low.

1530,KEY,"JetBlue Airways (JBLU) joined Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) in lifting its forecast for a key revenue metric.JetBlue now sees Q1 unit revenue surging 6.1% year-over-year, above the prior guidance range of 3.5%-5.5%.The carrier attributed the upgraded forecast to stronger demand in March as well as to an increase in cancellations, which reduces capacity and lifts unit revenue, in the final weeks of the month.For the Q1 in total, revenue per available seat mile was positively impacted by approximately 1 point due to increased cancellations. The timing of Easter in March this year lifted unit revenue by 2.5 points.

1536,KEY,"This week, the FBI raided the office, hotel room and home of President Trump's personal attorney and self-described ""fixer,"" Michael Cohen.According to various media reports, the Department of Justice signed off on a warrant for the search; presumably, the law enforcement agency is searching for evidence regarding Cohen's $130,000 payment to pornography actress Stormy Daniels, who allegedly had a one-night stand with Trump in 2006. Cohen has openly stated that he paid Daniels to shut up about her peccadillo with Trump — and he has said that Trump had no knowledge of the payment.That presents a problem. If Cohen paid off Daniels without Trump's knowledge, that raises the question as to whether their agreement was binding. If not, then Trump may have been party to a violation of campaign finance law, since a $130,000 in-kind donation is well above any legal limit. And if Cohen and Trump coordinated that arrangement, none of their communications on the matter are subject to attorney-client privilege.So, it's quite possible that the FBI and DOJ may have just ensnared Cohen and, by extension, Trump, in a serious scandal.But this raises another question: Where the hell were the FBI and DOJ when it came to Hillary Clinton? Trump himself has been enraged by the disparity between law enforcement's treatment of Clinton and its treatment of him. He rightly points out that the FBI and DOJ worked to exonerate Clinton, with former FBI Director James Comey going so far as to change the definition of existing law to avoid recommending her indictment for mishandling classified material.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd not only did then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch meet with former President Bill Clinton on a tarmac in the middle of the election cycle and the investigation of his wife; Lynch's Department of Justice allowed Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton's top aide, to claim attorney-client privilege. As Andrew McCarthy of National Review pointed out at the time, Mills was involved in the scrubbing of over 30,000 emails, yet the DOJ ""indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI's ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation."" Furthermore, Mills was allowed to sit in on Clinton's interview with the FBI as Clinton's lawyer.And herein lies the problem for the DOJ and the FBI.Let's assume, for a moment, that everything they're doing now is totally honest and aboveboard — that there's no attempt to ""get"" President Trump and they're just following where the evidence leads. Many conservatives will rightly point to the DOJ and FBI treatment of Hillary Clinton, and state that the agencies ought to be consistent in their application of the law and leave Trump alone. Or they'll suggest that Trump ought to turn those agencies into personal defense organizations, as former President Obama did.Once supposedly neutral organizations are made partisan, a return to neutrality looks partisan. That means that the FBI and DOJ damn well better have gold-plated evidence against Cohen; they better not leak ancillary information damaging Trump to the press; and they better have dotted all their i's and crossed all their t's.If not, there will be hell to pay, not merely for those agencies but for a country that can no longer trust its own law enforcement agencies.Other columns by Ben Shapiro

1538,KEY,"Great listeners gather more facts and opinions while forging deeper connections with others. Better yet, they use their attentiveness to boost their creative problem-solving skills.By capturing more of what people say — and remaining receptive to wide-ranging input — you increase your learning and identify new approaches to address thorny problems. Rapt listeners train their minds to expand with each tidbit of new information.While it's not easy to keep quiet when you're tempted to assert your rightness or showcase your smarts, you'll reap huge benefits. To listen effectively and flex your innovative muscles:Embrace mindfulness. Many people admit they could listen better, but they lapse into bad habits when it counts. To differentiate yourself from the herd, prepare to listen with care.""What separates good listeners is a mindfulness practice long before an interaction,"" said Brenda Bailey-Hughes, a senior lecturer at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business in Bloomington, Ind. Taking five minutes to sit quietly in which you will yourself to ignore distractions and concentrate on one thing (such as an object in the room) can strengthen your ability to focus on speakers later, she says.Set the stage. If you want to pick someone's brain, exhibit curiosity from the outset. Signal your intent to digest every word.""Shove your paperwork aside, put your phone away, close your office door,"" Bailey-Hughes said. ""You've got to look like you're going to listen. That helps you stay focused and it helps the speaker"" feel like the center of attention.Crave the details. Listen with the goal of empathizing with the speaker. Ideally, you want to remove your biases so that you view the situation through the other person's eyes.Don't assume you know what someone is about to say — and rush to respond. Instead, stay silent and wait to offer your advice or opinions.""If I understand your problem well, it's easier to come up with an innovative solution,"" Bailey-Hughes said. ""You want to be a frog in the pond rather than a bird flying over the pond. Listening is your pathway into the pond so that you understand their experience and their feelings about their experience.""Stop cutting in. Adept listeners rarely interrupt. They prefer to purse their lips shut and let speakers take their time in formulating their thoughts.""Interrupting is a common problem for people in power,"" said Dorie Clark, an adjunct professor at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. ""If you shut down a person enough times, they'll stop bringing ideas to you. You're eliminating a good data source.""Align your body. Speakers tend to open up to listeners who demonstrate interest. To underscore your eagerness to learn, send nonverbal cues that reinforce your curiosity.Nod to acknowledge that you understand a key point. Smile sympathetically if appropriate. Maintain eye contact, especially if others lurk nearby vying for your attention.""If you're talking face-to-face, position your feet toward the person, not away from them or toward the door,"" said Clark, author of ""Stand Out.""Bailey-Hughes offers a similar tip: Align your heart and torso with the speaker's heart and torso. Turning toward someone rather than shifting your body as if you're eager to escape will heighten your nonverbal connection.Withhold judgment. When you hear a fresh idea, respond by digging to learn more. Ask a few neutrally worded questions to flesh out the speaker's suggestion.Even if your initial reaction is negative, don't say so. Listening with receptivity does not obligate you to endorse what you hear. You can always render a verdict later after investigating further and deliberating at your own pace.

1547,KEY,"Energy is perhaps beginning to gain a larger presence in IBD's new highs list, be it oil and gas or alternatives such as solar energy. And SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are making some noise in the form of sharp new highs.SolarEdge cleared a narrow, tight consolidation as shares got as high as 59.20, up 4.7%, before retreating. Despite the reversal, gains for the week are still robust.Notice on a weekly chart how the expert in inverters, which turn photovoltaic power into usable electricity, has not touched its 10-week moving average since its breakout during the week ended Feb. 16. A first or second test of the 10-week line usually presents a lower-risk opportunity to add shares to a winning position in the stock.So, what can you do when the stock refuses to come close to even pricking the 10-week moving average?For aggressive investors, one suggestion is to engage in an advanced buying technique. In SolarEdge's case, a move past 58.30, 10 cents above the March 27 peak, in strong volume offers a place to add a very small number of shares. Never buy the same amount as you normally would at a proper breakout point. The reason? To avoid your overall cost per share from running up too fast.This advanced follow-on entry point is based on the method that IBD founder Bill O'Neil used to find ways to buy more shares in some of his biggest stock market winners, including Pic N Save (now known as Big Lots (BIG)) and Amgen (AMGN). After a stock wages a strong run-up, find a period of two to four weeks in which the stock does not fall much and trades relatively tight. Volume should be dull. Then buy as the stock clears the highest price within such a narrow consolidation.In the case of SolarEdge, the stock fell 0.8% and 2.6% during the final two weeks of March. Those are paltry declines compared with the 37% ascent achieved in the prior five weeks.

1550,KEY,"Free Speech: We can remember when the left used to accuse conservatives of being prudish censors. Now it's the left that appears determined to censor speech it doesn't like. And they appear to have three incredibly powerful allies in their quest: Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.The CEO's of those tech giants — Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Susan Wojcicki — routinely describe their services as neutral platforms, fiercely committed to openness and free expression.""Twitter stands for freedom of expression,"" Dorsey once declared. Twitter's general manager in the U.K. once called it ""the free speech wing of the free speech party.""YouTube parent Google claims that ""the flow of ideas and open access to information on the web helps communities grow and nations prosper.""Zuckerberg told a Senate hearing on Tuesday that Facebook is ""a platform for all ideas.""But lately, these sites are starting to act more like the speech police: blocking, censoring or stigmatizing posts and videos they don't like under the gauzy notion of improving public discourse or protecting people from ""fake news.""At his Senate hearing, for example, Zuckerberg told Sen. Ted Cruz that Facebook (FB) will ban ""anything that makes people feel unsafe in the community.""He also bragged that his company will soon have artificial intelligence tools to ""proactively police and enforce safety across the community.""Twitter's Dorsey tweeted in early March that ""we're committing Twitter to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable toward progress."" He also said that Twitter (TWTR) is building a ""systemic framework to help encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking."" Fast Company reports that Dorsey has been personally involved in deciding what Twitter accounts to ban or downgrade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLate last year, YouTube (parent company, Alphabet) announced that it would stigmatize videos, even if they didn't violate its terms of service, if it deemed them to ""contain controversial religious or supremacist content."" Those videos, it said ""will be placed in a limited state"" meaning they ""won't be recommended, won't be monetized, and won't have key features including comments, suggested videos, and likes.""Whatever this is, it ain't ""free speech.""So, just who are the people who've appointed themselves as arbiters of what counts as ""healthy"" or ""civil"" speech, or decides what is controversial or makes people feel unsafe? Can we count on them to be fair and unbiased judges? You decide.YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki is a major league Democratic donor. Since 2012, she's handed over a total of $96,600 to the DNC, according to Federal Election Commission records.She gave $5,000 to Obama's campaign in 2012, and $5,400 to Clinton's campaign. She backed far left Sen. Kamala Harris and has donated money to various state Democratic parties.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey isn't much of a campaign contributor, at least not monetarily. His last campaign donations were in 2012, when he gave $5,000 to Democrat Richard Carmona in his run against Sen. Jeff Flake.But Dorsey has been described as ""an ardent leftist who has campaigned with radicals like DeRay Mckesson."" And he recently raised a stir after tweeting a link to an article published in Medium, which basically calls for an end to the Republican party and a California-style one-party state nationwide. ""America finally needs to take the Republican Party down for a generation or two,"" the authors write.""Great read,"" Dorsey said of the article.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn't as easy to pin down ideologically as Dorsey or Wojcicki. He's given plenty of money to Democrats — including $10,000 to the San Francisco Democratic County Central Committee, and campaign contributions to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. But he's also given money to Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch and Marco Rubio, as well as John Boehner.Whatever Zuckerberg's own political leanings, it's clear that plenty of his employees aren't nearly as balanced as he is.Facebook recently blocked the site of two pro-Trump black women — called Diamond and Silk — which has some 1.3 million followers. Facebook told them that their ""content and brand"" were ""unsafe to the community."" Zuckerberg told a House panel this week that ""our team made an enforcement error.""Funny how these sorts of ""enforcement errors"" only seem to happen to conservatives.Facebook ""mistakenly"" suppressed conservative news from its trending topics list until 2016. It's new algorithm for deciding what shows up in news feeds just happens to hit conservative news sites hardest.Last year, Facebook blocked a dozen conservative Catholic sites, blaming its ""spam detection mechanism. It recently banned an ad for a Catholic university in Ohio because it included an image of a crucifix. Incredibly, Facebook's reason was that this image — which is central to the Catholic Church — was ""shocking, sensational or excessively violent.""YouTube's content police, meanwhile, deemed academic videos that express conservative views on Dennis Prager's Prager U channel to be unfit for general consumption. Various other conservatives say they've had their videos shunted off to the YouTube demonetization ghetto. Earlier this year, YouTube moderators deleted several conservative videos and channels across the platform, which YouTube later said were ""mistaken removals."" The site most recently took down several gun-related videos.Conservatives, meanwhile, say that Twitter ""shadowbans"" their tweets — by blocking them from showing up in followers' feeds.The company has repeatedly denied this, but undercover reporters for Project Veritas caught Twitter employees appearing to admit to the practice. And when Independent Journal Review editor Caleb Hull complained that people weren't seeing his tweets, Twitter admitted that he'd been ""mistakenly caught by our spam filters.""When in doubt, blame the spam filters.Now, to be clear, we are the first to defend a company's right to run its business the way it sees fit, even if it means blocking certain people from its sites. And we oppose intrusive government regulation of these companies.But that doesn't absolve Facebook, Twitter or YouTube from attacks for their glaring political biases, or their rank hypocrisy about free speech, or for misleading users about what they are and how they operate.

BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) and Ultragenyx (RARE) also lifted on the news.""Gene therapy names (are) likely to benefit from the tailwind,"" he said in a note to clients Monday.

UniQure jumped 5.7% to 27.03. Ultragenyx climbed 3.9% to 52.67, and BioMarin got a 1.5% boost, to 79.83.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOf the main gene therapy players, Audentes and UniQure both have in-house manufacturing, which makes them most similar to AveXis, Schwartz said. Gene therapies transplant normal genes into cells that have missing or defective ones to correct genetic disorders.Audentes is working on gene therapy treatments for four rare diseases. It is furthest along in a treatments for a neuromuscular disease and a disorder that can lead to brain damage in infants. UniQure is furthest along with therapies for hemophilia B and Huntington's disease.BioMarin recently finished its gene therapy manufacturing facility but has a higher valuation, making it a less likely takeover target, Schwartz said. Of the group, BioMarin is more diversified rather than being a pure player in gene therapy.Ultragenyx also recently acquired Dimension Therapeutics, but that hasn't been viewed well by investors, Schwartz said. So far, it ""does not appear to be a major value driver justifying an acquisition of Ultragenyx.""The implications of Novartis' deal for Spark are less clear. Spark is already partnered with Novartis on gene therapy Luxturna in Europe. Investors had been optimistic about the potential for a merger between Novartis and Spark.""We think investor optimism about a Novartis-Spark deal has supported the stock to some degree,"" Schwartz said. ""Today's Novartis-AveXis announcement could consume some of Novartis' gunpowder, or it could signal the potential for Novartis to remain on the hunt for more gene therapy assets.""Broadly, analysts see a high likelihood that the deal between Novartis and AveXis closes. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams doesn't see any antitrust issues that would delay the close, which is expected midyear.""And while it is possible additional bidders could come over the top of Novartis' offer, given the high premium above last week's closing price we view this as a low likelihood,"" he said in a note to clients.Canaccord analyst Sumant Kulkarni says the buyout is not surprising. But the 88% premium Novartis agreed to pay on AveXis shares assumes a lot has to go right for its gene therapy, AVXS-101. The therapy is being tested in spinal muscular atrophy.Kulkarni estimates AVXS-101 could hit the market in 2020 to treat the youngest patients and in 2021 to treat older children diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy. For 2024, he models a $2.4 billion in peak U.S. sales of AVXS-101. In 2026, he sees $2.3 billion in peak sales outside the U.S.After that, though, Kulkarni expects sales of AVXS-101 to decline, assuming gene therapy can cure the disease. Most analysts note that gene therapy remains in its infancy and it's too early to determine whether it can offer a long-term cure for disease.""We believe that a lot of things have to go right from here for the deal to work,"" he said. ""That said, Novartis, with its global presence and significant depth of resources, may have the muscle to pull off this deal, especially if AVXS-101 cleanly navigates through regulatory and reimbursement pathways in the U.S. and abroad.""Investors have been well aware of the potential for AVXS-101 to chip away at sales of Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. Still, Biogen shares rose 2.9% to close at 265.09.""This deal means that Biogen could now face a competitor in Novartis that has significantly more competitive muscle vs. AveXis alone,"" Kulkarni said. ""This development raises the stakes on the outcome of Biogen's high-risk/high-reward pipeline bets in Alzheimer's disease.""But Biogen's Alzheimer's assets aren't likely to have clinical data until 2019-20, he said. In the meantime, investors will key in on the likelihood for Biogen to make its own deal. Many of its partnerships have fallen flat with investors as they've been defensive, too small or risky, he said.Still, Biogen has ""significant financial flexibility"" to pull off an acquisition, he said. Some investors actually would have liked Biogen to buy AveXis so it could own the spinal muscular atrophy space.Kulkarni models Spinraza sales of $1.7 billion and $2.4 billion in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and peak sales of $3.5 billion in 2021. After that, he expects sales to decline amid pressure from AVXS-101.Meanwhile, patients are the biggest beneficiaries as Biogen and Novartis duke it out for share of the spinal muscular atrophy market.""The SMA community will benefit from two large companies, Biogen and Novartis, battling for pole position in the space, where Roche (RHHBY) (via PTC Therapeutics (PTCT)) also has an interest,"" he wrote.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors Rich

1555,KEY,"Following months of political maneuvering and seven rounds of negotiations between U.S., Canadian, and Mexican officials, the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement remains uncertain. Despite a clear record of advancing U.S. economic interests, the possibility remains that U.S. negotiators might remove key provisions responsible for those advances or even withdraw from the agreement altogether. This would be a grave mistake for the United States.Negotiated a quarter century ago, Nafta was intended to create economic bridges across North America, linking producers in the U.S., Canada and Mexico with burgeoning markets across the region. By most measures, the agreement has been an astonishing success and a strong driver for Main Street America. Today, trade with Canada and Mexico supports 14 million American jobs and accounts for nearly $500 billion in annual exports. Post-Nafta, the U.S. economy has added, on average, over a million jobs per year and attracted nearly $4.5 trillion in foreign direct investment.But Nafta does more than simply support jobs and build American wealth.Canada and Mexico are two of our most significant energy trading partners. The strongly integrated North American energy trade relationship, along with our American energy revolution, has allowed the U.S. to solidify its global energy dominance. Remaining in Nafta is critical for building on the energy trade success the U.S. has achieved thus far.Additionally, Nafta has helped provide much-needed stability for American firms doing business abroad. Key provisions in the agreement promote the rule of law and combat the undermining efforts of transnational organized crime.Other measures safeguard substantial American overseas investments. For example, Nafta's Investor State Dispute System (ISDS) offers legal recourse for American businesses that find themselves on the wrong end of unscrupulous business practices. In fact, ISDS lawsuits filed in Canada and Mexico have resulted in settlements for American companies of over $100 million — compensation that would not be available if ISDS were eliminated from Nafta.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIf American companies had to rely upon traditional state-to-state dispute settlement mechanisms and weaker legal protections for private property in Canada and Mexico, the result would be reduced protections for American investors. Clearly, provisions such as the ISDS enhance security for U.S. investors and facilitate foreign investment here.Despite the advantages wrought by the ISDS, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer reportedly is considering dropping the provision from a renegotiated Nafta. This possibility has drawn strong protests from the business sector and prompted more than 100 members of Congress to urge Lighthizer to support keeping the measure in place. Doing so would certainly be in keeping with the Trump administration's commitment to keep America open for business.There is clearly much at stake when it comes to the future of Nafta. It is time for the U.S. to reinforce its commitment to free and open trade in North America. This starts with committing to modernizing and improving Nafta, but not withdrawing from or demanding harmful changes to the agreement. Walking away from Nafta simply does not advance American interests.Rather than doing harm by eliminating beneficial provisions such as ISDS, Congress and the Trump administration should build on the economic benefits Nafta has already generated. Current Nafta renegotiations should focus on strengthening North American economies, creating a pathway for U.S. competitiveness with nations like China, and continuing to grow American jobs and American exports.By supporting Nafta's future, we nurture the already robust and complex supply chains that support major industries such as auto manufacturing and pave the way for sustained growth in U.S. energy exports to Mexico and Canada. Those advances in the American energy sector continue to put downward pressure on domestic energy prices that work to the benefit of both American families and American producers. Importantly, a strong Nafta also reinforces our nation's significant agriculture sector, which has seen its exports in North America quadruple since the agreement went into effect.With three in five American voters wanting their government to negotiate more trade deals, public support for Nafta remains strong. Hopefully, Congress and the Trump administration will continue to pay attention and work swiftly to keep Nafta advancing U.S. interests.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Will Trump's Tariff Temptation Kill His Economic Boom?Trade Wars Have No Winners, Only Badly Damaged SurvivorsDid U.S. And China Just Fire First Shots In A Destructive Trade War?

1557,KEY,"When the president (reluctantly) signed the recent federal discretionary spending bill for $1.3 trillion, conservatives nationwide were ""mad as hell.""Why? While the bill provided for $165 billion in much needed defense spending increases over the next two years, to get Democrat votes to overcome the filibuster, it also included additional spending for Planned Parenthood, the National Endowment for the Arts, Legal Services and hundreds of other special (liberal) interest programs that have come to typify the ""swamp"" of Washington spending.The Filibuster Rule, which requires 60 votes to pass any appropriation in the Senate, offers Senate Minority Democrats power the voters did not give them.  And Democrats are very good at using that rule to get results the majority of voters do not support, like the recent Omnibus spending bill.After years of the budget Sequester rules and war in the Middle East draining the military to dangerously low levels, Democrats understood that a defense spending increase was essential to Republicans. The Omnibus also included $90 billion in disaster relief for humanitarian assistance and rebuilding after hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and other key Republican states.  Democrats know Republicans do not want to disappoint their own voters in these large states.So Democrats also leveraged those Republican preferences and national priorities into restrictions on border and immigration enforcement, limitations on hiring more ICE border enforcement agents, and on deportations of illegal aliens who have committed violent crimes within the U.S., as well as continued funding for Obamacare.The resulting supposedly nearly $1 trillion in deficits is inflated by phony official estimates of $1.5 trillion in revenue losses over 10 years attributed to the tax reform/tax cuts. Rapid economic growth from tax reform will surprise the untutored who fail to account for the glorious history of tax revenue increases from prior tax cuts. Those additional revenues plus the spending cuts identified below can actually balance the budget, as resulted in four consecutive years from 1998 to 2001 following the 1990s Gingrich budget cuts.The Omnibus spending increases can be offset through the 1974 Impoundment Act, which empowers the President to rescind appropriated federal spending if Congress approves within 45 days by simple majority vote, with no Filibuster, as Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel pointed out recently.The President can name specific spending cuts under that Impoundment Act which simple Republican majorities can approve offsetting ultimately the entire $300 billion Omnibus spending increase over two years. That would thrill the Republican conservative base and redeem Republican Congressional majorities.Strassel identifies for specific cuts ""everything from carbon-capture technology to pecan producers to the Gateway Tunnel Project to the Environmental Protection Agency."" She also suggests adopting the cuts proposed in President Trump's budget, including ""wholesale cuts in domestic agencies—like the EPA or the Education Department [state and local government responsibility].""Cutting the Education Department would be especially supportive of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who had proposed $9 billion in Department cuts in Trump's budget, only to have education unions reverse that in the Omnibus for $2.6 billion in spending increases, with the additional funding focused on Obama Administration education initiatives.To that we can add some cuts to Obamacare, and corporate welfare in Commerce, Agriculture and Energy. Spending cuts remember were a third element in Reagan's economic growth plan, right after tax cuts and deregulation.The Filibuster Rule is what empowers Democrats to threaten government shutdowns, as Democrats know their party-controlled media will make sure Republicans are blamed.  Republicans forget that they have won every election after shutdowns resulting in reduced spending, all the way back to the Reagan years.The Filibuster does not date back to the Founding Fathers, or the Constitution.  It arose out of 19th century Senate rules limiting debate, formalized in its modern form only about 100 years ago.Decades ago, the Filibuster Rule was reduced from 67 votes to 60.  More recently, confirmation of presidential appointments, judges and now even Supreme Court Justices now only require a simple majority.  That has worked out well, enabling Trump to appoint a more consistently conservative Cabinet even than Reagan's, and top-notch judges without nasty judicial confirmation battles.Now it is time for the Filibuster to be eliminated, at least for every fiscal vote.  Democrats can enjoy power over taxes and spending they earn at the ballot box, not as granted to them by outdated Senate rules.But think of the federal fiscal liberation of voting as in reconciliation with no filibuster rule on everything: repeal of Obamacare, tax cuts, deregulation, privatization, and most fundamentally entitlement reform.  This is what Washington and democracy can look like.

Nuplazid treats psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease, and is being tested in an array of other conditions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNovartis agreed to pay $218 per share of AveXis in an offer that represents an 88% premium to where AveXis closed on Friday. The deal is a 72% premium to AveXis' 30-day volume-weighted average stock price, AveXis said in a news release.AveXis is developing AVXS-101, a gene therapy treatment for spinal muscular atrophy diagnosed in young children. The drug would rival Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis' Spinraza, which is already approved to treat the condition. Biogen stock, though, fell a fraction, to 257.52, though rose 1% in extended trading.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams credited the deal for ""breathing life into (the) sector,"" in a note. The biotech group has been under pressure recently. Shares sank to as much as a two-month low on Friday, but collectively advanced 3.2% on Monday.This ""could be the (mergers and acquisitions) kick-start that the sector has awaited in our view,"" he said. ""There has been anticipation, but no major deal and trepidation on drug pricing and risk-highlighting negative catalysts (have kept) sentiment down of late.""The transaction is expected to close midyear.

The study, dubbed Keynote-042, tested Keytruda as a single drug vs. chemo in patients who have the PD-L1 protein in at least 1% of their tumor cells.The study examined overall survival. Interim analysis shows Keytruda kept patients alive longer than chemotherapy as lone treatments. Safety was in line with earlier studies. Merck will now continue the study to determine Keytruda's impact on progression-free survival.Patients who have PD-L1 protein in 1%-49% of their tumors represent 10%-15% of the overall market in lung cancer, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note. Bristol's rival drug, Opdivo, failed to improve progression-free survival in patients with PD-L1 in at least 5% of their tumors, he noted.Bristol shares touched an eight-month low in intraday trading on the news but recovered somewhat and closed down 0.7%, at 60.48.AbbVie (ABBV) ran up 0.8%, to 90.48, and rose another 1.2% after hours, after its investigational drug upadacitinib beat its own blockbuster Humira in a study of rheumatoid arthritis patients.Patients received either 15 milligrams of upadacitinib daily, 40 milligrams of Humira every other week, or a placebo. AbbVie examined patients at week 12 for at least a 20% improvement in rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and clinical remission.The study showed 71% of upadacitinib patients experienced a 20% improvement in symptoms vs. 63% and 36% of Humira and placebo patients, respectively. Of upadacitinib patients, 29% were in clinical remission vs. 18% and 6% of Humira and placebo patients.""We are excited by these strong results, which add to the body of evidence that support the potential of upadacitinib to be an important treatment option for patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"" AbbVie spokesperson Michael Severino said in a prepared statement.Rumors emerged that Celgene could be eyeing takeovers of Agios or Jounce Therapeutics (JNCE). Agios popped and Jounce surged 7%, to 19.78. A buyout would follow Celgene's recent acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, a cancer biotech.The report emerged from the Financial Times, which cited unnamed sources. Celgene is reportedly ""hunting for acquisition targets with promising drugs"" to offset the loss of patent protection for its key blockbuster, Revlimid.Celgene already partners with Agios and Jounce, both of which are working on cancer drugs. Agios has a market cap of $4.6 billion, eclipsing Jounce's market cap, which remains under $1 billion. Jounce went public last year.In similar news, Ionis and AstraZeneca announced a partnership to develop a drug to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Under the terms of the deal, AstraZeneca will pay Ionis a $30 million license fee to take over responsibility for the development and commercialization of the drug.As the drug advances, Ionis is also eligible to receive up to $300 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties up to the low teens on sales of the drug.Ionis stock advanced 2.3%, to 41.61, as AstraZeneca lifted 1.4%, to 35.90, at the close.Menlo Therapeutics (MNLO) and Acadia were among the biggest biotech stock losers on Monday. Shares of Menlo tanked 76.8%, falling to 8.17, just three months after going public. The stock had been forming a cup with handle with a 38.92 buy point. Shares rose 2% after hours.The tumble followed news on Sunday that Menlo's itching drug failed in an eczema study. Menlo found no statistically significant differences between its drug, serlopitant, and a placebo. Chief Executive Steve Basta noted there were still signs of improvement for serlopitant-treated patients.Serlopitant is also being tested in another skin condition known as prurigo nodularis, itching associated with psoriasis and chronic cough. The setback in eczema doesn't necessarily hurt Menlo's chances for serlopitant in prurigo nodularis, Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said in a note.""After all, prurigo nodularis is an altogether different condition,"" he said. ""The larger point here is that Menlo decided to run a broad clinical program in (itching) in order to have a handful of potential pathways to market for serlopitant.""Amsellem kept his overweight rating on Menlo.Meanwhile, Acadia dived 23.4%, to 16.50, on a CNN story outlining deaths in Parkinson's patients who took Nuplazid for psychosis.Nuplazid was approved in 2016 to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's. After its approval, patients continued to experience hallucinations and side effects including death, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue, CNN wrote.Since its approval, more than 700 patients on Nuplazid have died. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medicine listed as ""suspect"" in at least 500 death reports. Acadia, though, notes that two studies have shown no difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and a placebo.The drug is Acadia's only approved medicine. Acadia is testing Nuplazid in dementia-related psychosis, schizophrenia and depression.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

1566,KEY,"The Saudi crown prince Muhammed bin Salman has been undertaking a weekslong U.S. charm offensive. One of the key themes surrounding his visit is the kingdom's initiative to extend the oil production cuts that it leads jointly with Russia.Despite an uptick in oil prices, a closer look at the oil market unveils the real winner of curtailing crude exports: America. U.S. oil output broke through the 10 million barrels a day mark for the first time in half a century. And, according to a recent statement by the Director of the International Energy Agency, it could reach a record of 12.1 million barrels a day in 2023.Although the price of a barrel of oil has somewhat retreated from the January $70 heights, it is still $10 above its level a year ago and more than double what it was during the price collapse in early 2016. This has been helped along by phenomenal discipline within OPEC+, as the agreement on production cuts between OPEC, Russia and nine more exporting countries is informally known. Apparently compliance has reached a surprising 138% — exporters have made bigger cuts than initially pledged.As always, however, the devil is in the details.The bigger cutbacks are largely an optical illusion: Curtailed production is due to the protracted but inevitable collapse of Venezuela's oil industry. Just last year its oil production shrunk by 20%, taking close to 500,000 barrels of daily output off the market.Moreover, the actual influence of the production cuts on the market is far from obvious. Policymakers in OPEC countries believe that restraining output created a floor under the crude price. Most likely, it helped, but it was not the only reason for the price recovery. The global oil market is extraordinary convoluted and multifaceted; behind every price movement there several overlapping price drivers. Despite heightened media attention to production cuts, other factors played an important role, for instance, relative U.S. dollar weakness, or upbeat global GDP growth forecasts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt the moment, the new alliance (or ROPEC — OPEC plus Russia — as the media referred to it recently) is a major cause célèbre. Are we really witnessing the creation of a new colossus which can single-handedly balance the energy market? Those who believe that also believe the 2014-15 oil price crash was business as usual — just another cycle which can be managed by production cuts. But from what we've seen so far, it was not. It was a market shift, and one which favored the U.S.Several factors played a role in said shift, but the biggest was likely the shale revolution. In essence, a leap in shale companies' efficiency caused a fall in the oil price. As a consequence, the entire petroleum industry had to become leaner and cut costs to adjust to the new equilibrium.And once again, American shale companies were ahead of the pack. Cost reductions among global oil companies were estimated at 16% in 2015-16, while among U.S. shale producers they reached 26% on average in the same period.It's survival of the fittest. In the grand scheme of things, Saudi Arabia and Russia are trying to balance not just one government, nor even a country, but the entire industry. Fundamentally, it's OPEC+ vs. market efficiency. In the longer run, however, this game cannot be won, because it will require an ever bigger sacrifice by those countries cutting production. To defend a certain price minimum, say $60 per barrel, the coalition of petro-states will have to carry on reducing their output.Arguably, leaders of the Gulf states and Russia are falling victim to politics, a field in which it's better to be seen doing something than nothing. Especially when no one is sure what (if anything) would work. But who is the biggest economic winner in this game? Ironically, it's America yet again.Each time Saudi Arabia and their allies restrict exports, they prop up the price and create a vacant market share which then gives a boost to those producers outside the agreement that are not bound by quotas. The biggest among them is the United States. Naturally, thousands of American companies are keen for a free ride.All of that is happening already. The U.S. has just overtaken Saudi Arabia in oil production and is expected to rival Russia soon. No wonder U.S. oil companies were expected to be especially cordial with the Saudi delegation during the princely visit.

1567,KEY,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and other bank stocks cruised higher from late 2017 to February on diet of rising Treasury yields, a more-hawkish Fed rate hike outlook, lower corporate taxes, deregulation and a strengthening economy.The Federal Reserve spooked Wall Street by sanctioning Wells Fargo (WFC), sending the stock tumbling in early February. Other big bank stocks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup (C) also retreated.Even as analysts await some big first-quarter earnings gains from the banks, fears of a protracted trade battle with China have raised questions about the impact on the economy, Fed rates and the stock market. Bank stocks are heavily dependent on the economy and interest rates. Their relative strength lines, which measure a stock's performance against the S&P 500, have also flattened.But this is not that unusual. Bank stocks can lead the general market for a stretch, as they did modestly from September to February. But over the long term they struggle to outperform the S&P 500 index, as shown by RS lines. Bank stocks are a big part of the benchmark S&P 500, so if financial stocks are doing well they'll help lift the overall market. Banks tend to rally with the broader economy, which is good news for stocks generally.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThat makes it all the more important for investors to focus on the best-performing bank stocks. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (MS) had a decent run in much of 2017 vs. the S&P 500. But Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup had different issues that held them back.Shares of JPMorgan Chase are making their way through a flat base with a 119.43 buy point. But the stock sliced below its 50-day line on March 22, and has been below the key test of investor support since.Shares rose 1.2% to 110.40 in the stock market today, well off session highs as the major averages pulled back. The stock's RS line — the blue line in the chart below — is off recent longtime highs. The RS line rose from early September to late February, but the modest outperformance goes back to last June.CEO Jamie Dimon, in JPMorgan Chase's annual letter to shareholders last week, said that ""anything that starts to resemble a trade war"" could be bad for the global economy. He recommended that the U.S. solicit the aid of Japan and Europe in negotiating a path forward with China.JPMorgan reports earnings Friday morning.Citigroup, which has a large international business, has skidded below its 50-day and 200-day lines over the past month. The bank's RS line has also eased.Citigroup was a top-performing bank in mid-2017, but the RS line has been slumping since October.Shares gained 1.2% on Monday.Citigroup reports fourth-quarter results early Friday.Similar to Citi, Wells Fargo has been submerged below its 50-day and 200-day lines in recent weeks. The stock rose 2 cents on Monday.Wells Fargo, however, has its own unique problems. The Federal Reserve in February hit Wells with sanctions that will prevent it from growing, citing ""widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns"" after revelations that employees were creating fake consumer accounts in attempt to hit lofty sales goals, as well as suspicious practices elsewhere.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reportedly will levy big fines on Wells Fargo soon, Reuters reported Monday.But even before the early February tumble, Wells has been lagging the S&P 500 since late 2016, or even July 2015.Wells Fargo earnings are due Friday.With its large U.S. business, Bank of America, which climbed 0.8% on Monday, is most sensitive to the Fed's actions on interest rates. But similar to its peers, Bank of America shares have tumbled below their 50-day line. The bank's RS line has also flatlined.BofA earnings are on tap next Monday.Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 0.5% to 53.35 on Monday, under their 50-day line but above their 200-day line. The stock had cleared a 58.15 buy point of a flat base last month before sinking.Earnings will come after a year in which Morgan Stanley's fixed-income trading desk, at times, outdid rival Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley has focused more on its steadier wealth management business in recent years, and backed away from trading since the financial crisis.Morgan Stanley earnings are due April 18.Goldman Sachs' stock remains in a flat base with a 273.89 buy point. Shares are also testing support at their 200-day line after puncturing their 50-day line.Goldman's trading business had a surprisingly weak 2017, and that had an impact on the stock. The RS line hasn't made headway vs. the S&P 500 index over the past year.Shares rallied 0.9% to 252.19 on Monday.Goldman reports April 17.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Option Trading: Financial Earnings On Tap As Stock Market CorrectsQ1 Earnings: Netflix, 3 Top IPOs Join Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth5 Stocks From This Hot Sector Shine As Stock Market Volatility Continues

1568,KEY,"William J. O'Neil built IBD's ""10 Secrets To Success"" column as an action plan for anyone who wants to create a better life for oneself or for others.Secret No. 1? ""How You Think Is Everything."" In other words, stay focused on success.Secret No. 10: ""Be Honest And Dependable; Take Responsibility.""Perhaps an 11th secret helps the founder of Investor's Business Daily and Investors.com continue to influence readers today:No matter how big you've hit it, be modest. Stay humble.Editor's Note: The Chartered Market Technician Association recently honored Investor's Business Daily founder William O'Neil with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Bill O'Neil was one of the first people on Wall Street — and remains one of the few — to combine fundamental research with technical analysis, giving everyday investors the tools to change their lives. For readers who might not know the man who built IBD, we are updating and republishing this Leaders & Success profile, which first appeared four years ago on IBD's 30th anniversary. If you walked into his office at IBD's Los Angeles headquarters a few years ago, you would have found it similar to the way it was about 10 years earlier in 2004, when IBD celebrated its 20th birthday.The room was the same size as before, with barely enough space to house a conference table and shelves. Same metal desk. Same gray carpet. No mahogany paneling. No Impressionist or postmodernist paintings on the wall.Instead, it featured a portrait of a dog, front pages of IBD and a photo of O'Neil meeting President Reagan in the Oval Office in the 1980s.When a reporter asked O'Neil, ""Outside of starting IBD, what is the achievement you are most proud of?"" the Oklahoma native, now 85, arched his eyebrows, breathed deeply and shrugged.""I don't think of that, don't look at that very much,"" he replied. ""I think starting a business is important because you've got the total freedom to start and create what you want. We've obviously created products that have helped a lot of people.""He added: ""If you want to start a business, you've got to have some experience in the field. If you're going to be selling peanut butter or something, you better have some experience with peanut butter.""O'Neil never joins a conversation with an intention to boast. He publicly cares less about what success he's had and more about the organization's mission today: Make readers smarter investors.""I think the stock market is complicated itself, and not very many people really understand how the stock market works,"" he said. ""If you're going to invest in the stock market, you're going to make mistakes. The typical person doesn't want to buy and then turn around and sell it for a loss. To some extent, to be very successful in the market, you've got to do what you have to do, which means taking some profits and taking some losses.""O'Neil has done very well in a large number of stocks over the decades. In 1962, as a broker at Hayden Stone in Los Angeles, he made profits of more than $200,000 (more than $1.5 million in today's money) in a short play on discount department store chain Korvette, a long investment in Chrysler and a buy in Syntex, one of the first companies to cash in on the birth control pill.That haul helped the graduate of Southern Methodist University start his own institutional stock research firm — William O'Neil + Co. — on Nov. 7, 1963. One of the company's early achievements: managing money for the Vatican.In 2013, O'Neil's research firm celebrated 50 years in the business. It remains a force in the world of institutional stock research.He was one of the first people to use computers to collect vital stock information, and one of the first to place key information on fundamentals and buying trends by mutual funds and top money management firms right on the stock chart.These simple innovations made his products stand out immediately.""How did William O'Neil + Company survive and grow over 50 years? We concentrated on stocks, the one thing we know best,"" O'Neil wrote in the introduction to the book ""50 Years of Independent Market Vision."" ""People asked me why I didn't buy bonds or commodities. The answer was simple: I didn't want to be distracted.""He added: ""Just the concept of concentrating, seeing all the details, is important to innovation and being the best.""Twenty-one years after founding the securities company, O'Neil in 1984 launched Investor's Daily (later changed to Investor's Business Daily) with a mind toward building a new business and helping individual investors use the same tools as top money managers to find stock market winners.Today, IBD is more than a paper and a website. It hosts dozens of beginning-to-advanced-level workshops as well as IBD Summits to help investors of all levels, including money managers, to become smarter in the stock market and make consistent profits through the platforms Investors.com, Leaderboard, SwingTrader and MarketSmith.Awareness of IBD continues to grow. Investor's Business Daily reaches over 5 million investors each month who access IBD content across platforms including digital, mobile, print, events, meetups and social media.Brian Edwards, a former high school English teacher who moved to Southeast Asia to start an online toy manufacturing business, first met O'Neil during a two-day Level 4 Masters program workshop in Los Angeles in 2004.An active growth investor, Edwards asked O'Neil about the paper's online direction and whether he felt overwhelmed by the changes sweeping the media industry.""I was looking for insights. Bill's response was knowledgeable and reassuring, down-to-earth, the meat-and-potatoes variety. I like meat and potatoes,"" Edwards told IBD. ""Bill's investment approach is similar. He urges one to follow historically valid rules and not to get overwhelmed by emotion. He has found stability in an environment others find chaotic.""Does O'Neil ever take losses in stocks? Of course. One reason for his success in the market is the ability to consistently keep losses small, usually in the 3%-4% range.He quickly learned the benefit of acting fast when you realize you have made a mistake.In addition, early in his stock-investment career, O'Neil made a point to meet Gerald Loeb in New York. Loeb was making serious money as a stockbroker and wrote the investment classic ""The Battle for Investment Survival.""In that book, he advised people to limit losses to 10% in any stock.Loeb, a California native, went to Los Angeles and visited O'Neil, who recalls: ""As he was leaving, I asked Loeb, 'Do you always sell every stock in trouble at 10%?' He said, 'I would hope to be out of them much quicker than that.' ""Born in Oklahoma City, O'Neil moved with his family to Muskogee, roughly 40 miles southeast of Tulsa, when he was young.His father had left the family by then, but O'Neil says his aunt motivated him to strive for success. She encouraged him to sell magazines to women in the neighborhood when he was in grade school.O'Neil listened. Soon he landed a better-paying job on a newspaper route. He loved sports, particularly baseball, and worked hard to earn the extra $20 needed to buy a new glove or bat. After school, he hustled to finish his newspaper route so he could join baseball games.""I was a pitcher. You're competing with nine batters all game long. You can do all right, then in the sixth inning, one of them beats you,"" said O'Neil, who also played the cornet. ""I think I learned something from sports and a couple other activities.""O'Neil stresses that it's crucial to listen and learn from the very best in their respective fields.The same philosophy applies to books. O'Neil once bought a library of investment books and found that most were junk. Only five or six really helped him learn how to make money in the stock market.O'Neil himself has produced four editions of ""How to Make Money in Stocks"", a best-seller.""Everyone and his brother has written a book on investing,"" he said. ""Find out who is successful in a field, and if they've written a book, then the writing is from somebody who's been there, done that and been successful in that field. That, I think, is the whole key.""O'Neil is upbeat about the stock market's prospects over the next 30 years. ""The country will grow and continue to grow as it's done in the past. You cannot hold human nature down,"" he said. ""And you've got this freedom in the country, so there's a lot of opportunity. There will be new inventions, new developments, new companies. That I wouldn't worry about.""You have this constant renewal of new products coming along, new services coming along, and a company does pretty well for a while. Then the company either gets too large to grow or is replaced by someone else. That's been going on for cycle after cycle after cycle.""(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for analysis and commentary on growth stocks, buy points, sell signals, the CAN SLIM investment system, and financial markets.)RELATED:Meet The Man Who Highly Influenced Bill O'Neil In The Investing GameWhich Stocks Are Near A Buy Zone?The Latest Investor's Corner -- Tips And Insights To Help You Become A Better InvestorWhich Stocks Are Leading The IBD 50 Today?

1569,KEY,"Under Armour (UAA) had a crummy 2017 as the stock lost half its value. Shares have been showing some signs of life in recent weeks, retaking both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. But Under Armour's status as a cool-kid brand isn't doing so hot, particularly with women and teens.B. Riley FBR's annual athleticwear poll, first published in March, reveals signs that ""Under Armour's resonance with consumers has waned across both genders and in key age groups.""Nike (NKE) and Under Armour are both focused on courting female shoppers. But Under Armour has lost the most favor with women, B. Riley analyst Susan Anderson said on Thursday. That is a ""double negative"" for the brand, since the survey also found that a higher number of women plan to do more shopping for athletic clothes and shoes this year.(Nike has its own problem with women at the moment, and an internal Nike human resources memo, obtained by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, said that the company needs to do better to represent women and people of color at higher levels of the company.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseB. Riley's survey also said that millennials — a core demo for Under Armour — might be shifting their allegiances. The Baltimore-based brand still comes in No. 3 behind Nike and Adidas, notes Anderson, but Lululemon (LULU) and Gap's (GPS) Athleta are ranking higher with 18- to 34-year-olds these days, as ""we believe these consumers are migrating to higher-quality, athleisure-like brands.""And where Adidas has ridden the fashionable wave of nostalgia footwear, Under Armour appears to be suffering. As a running and casual shoe brand, Under Armour ""dropped significantly"" in the poll, sliding to sixth place from third, which Anderson attributes to Under Armour's lack of casual and retro footwear options.Separately, Susquehanna's Sam Poser reviewed a number of Under Armour's 10-K filings and said Wednesday that he believes that its international business may be growing fast but is ""heading down a similar path as North America given optimistic targets (which were missed in 4Q17), elevated inventory and deteriorating margins.""Poser called Under Armour's brand and inventory position ""precarious."" Trying to sell athletic shoes and clothes in the U.S. and Canada has been a tough business in recent years, and Nike has spent some time tightening its supply to match demand as it sees a reversal of its fortunes in North America.Both Anderson and Poser said Under Armour is losing shelf space at retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS).Under Armour shares fell 2.35% to finish at 17.47 in the stock market today, but are still up sharply this week. Shares have been trying to definitively regain support at the longer term 200-day after retaking the 50-day on earnings on Feb. 13. Prior to that, the stock hadn't come up for air above its 200-day since the fall of 2016.But the recovery comes as other athletic apparel stocks run to the front of the market.Nike shares advanced 1.7% to 69.59, approaching a 70.35 buy point.

1571,KEY,"Trade War: In the tit-for-tat trade war between the U.S. and China, pain is a major theme. The idea is to ratchet up the pain, through tariffs and other punishments, until one side says ""uncle."" But what if no one says ""uncle""?On Friday, President Trump doubled down, proposing $100 billion in added tariffs on Chinese goods, in addition to the $50 billion or so already imposed. That pretty much exceeds what China imports from the U.S. in any given year.""I'm not saying there won't be a little pain so we might lose a little of it, but we're going to have a much stronger country when we're finished, and that's what I'm all about,"" President Trump told WABC radio.China, meanwhile, on Friday withdrew from trade talks and promised to ""fight back with a major response,"" calling Friday's U.S. move ""arrogant."" A piece in China's government-run Xinhua news agency was blunt: ""As the tensions escalate, we want to expand the trade war to all Americans so that they have to choose whether to support Trump's unscrupulous move or to hold the president accountable.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYes, that's where we are now, as both Chinese and U.S. trade bureaucrats look for new ways to tighten the screws on the other. As the rhetoric heats up, neither side feels it can back down.And the debate has become deeply political. As we've noted, China slapped tariffs on products made in states that voted heavily for Trump, including such products as soybeans, SUVs, and small commercial jet planes.Meanwhile, Trump is targeting China's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative, according to longtime China watcher Gordon Chang. That's China's plan to leapfrog the U.S. and Europe in 10 key industries, ""including aircraft, robots, electric cars, and computer chips."" Chang notes that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's tariff list, released on Tuesday, ""goes after the Chinese aerospace, information and communications tech, and robotics sectors.""We're not sure how China will respond, but plainly they're running scared. They sold $463 billion in goods and services to the U.S. last year, vs. just $116 billion in purchases from the U.S. Why else would they begin telling Americans to ""hold the president accountable""?But trade disputes and tariffs have a history of becoming nasty economic downturns. There is, of course, the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which caused a massive contraction in global trade and output in the late 1920s and led to the Great Depression. More recently, in 1971, President Nixon devalued the dollar, imposed a 10% ""surtax"" on all imports, and the 1970s stagflation began.The point is, trade wars are hardly ever beneficial. So maybe it's time for both countries to cool their rhetoric, step back, and return to talking.

1573,KEY,"President Trump's latest threat to double down on his China trade war would be so bad that it may actually be good news in disguise.Yet his proposal to slap tariffs on another $100 billion worth of Chinese imports could signify that Trump now recognizes a trade war won't be ""fun"" or ""easy to win.""The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all tumbled more than 2% on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index undercut its 200-day line once again intraday, but closed above that key support. The Dow Jones, with a number of components that could be collateral damage in a trade war with China, led the way lower.Boeing (BA) lost 3.1%, Caterpillar (CAT) 3.5%, Nike (NKE) 2.9%, Cisco Systems (CSCO) 2.6%, Intel (INTC) 3.2% and Apple (AAPL) 2.6%. Apple, Intel, Boeing, Cisco and Nike rank among companies with the highest volume of sales to China.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump's late Thursday statement decried China's plan to retaliate with tariffs that match U.S. trade restrictions blow for blow. ""China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,"" Trump's statement read. In other words, China's strategy may be working.American farmers, and agricultural equipment makers like Deere & Co. (DE), may be among the biggest losers in a China trade war.Trump said that he's tasked the Department of Agriculture with working on ways ""to protect our farmers and agricultural interests."" That may be hard to do without an emergency congressional appropriation.Billions of dollars are at stake for U.S. farmers, with China imposing 25% tariffs on $14 billion worth of soybeans alone. Corn, cotton, tobacco and other crops also face tariffs. GOP lawmakers from farm states are said to worry about what Trump's trade war could do to their electoral prospects. At the least, Trump tariffs threaten to undermine the GOP's message about tax cuts finally unleashing economic growth.So it's not clear that Trump and the GOP are prepared for the fallout from China's retaliatory measures against the first $50 billion worth of Chinese imports he plans to target.Trump's 25% tariffs on high-tech imports won't take effect for at least a month. That will give businesses a chance to comment and negotiations to proceed. But the calm before any storm may last much longer if Trump wants protections in place for U.S. farmers.Further, the likelihood of Trump tariffs on up to another $100 billion worth of Chinese imports seems low. U.S. trade officials bent over backwards to avoid hitting Chinese imports that would harm American consumers. Nike shoes and Apple iPhones were left unscathed. Doubling down on tariffs without hitting consumers may not be possible.The takeaway for investors is that Trump's China trade war will likely be mostly talk for months to come. Further, Trump is probably discovering he has less leverage than he believed. As trade war costs hit home increasingly as Trump escalates, there's a good chance he will make a concerted effort at negotiation. While he'll hold out the threat of using a hammer, he doesn't have much of a hammer at his disposal.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: The Big Picture: Here's The Problem With The Stock Market RallyThis Defense Giant Breaks Out As 4 Peers Target Buy Points: Investing Action PlanHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

China said Friday morning that it would fight back ""to the end, and at any cost."" Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones also fell sharply.

1577,KEY,"Data Breach: Every day, it seems, Facebook faces new troubles on the privacy front. But there's one breach that Facebook executives still have not accounted for. Namely, the wholesale transfer of user data to the Obama campaign in 2012.The latest privacy flap came when Facebook (FB) announced on Sunday that it was suspending data analytics firm CubeYou from its platform, pending an audit, after CNBC reported that the firm was collecting user data through Facebook quizzes, which CubeYou claimed was ""for nonprofit academic research"" but was reportedly shared with marketers.On Monday, Facebook started sending notices to uses whose data ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica. It now says that an app — developed by an U.K.-based academic in 2013 and called ""This Is Your Digital Life"" — could have collected Facebook data on 87 million users. Cambridge, which at one point was advising the Trump campaign, got hold of the data. CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress Monday, telling lawmakers ""I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.""Meanwhile, consumer groups have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. They allege that Facebook's facial recognition software violates users' privacy rights.The Cambridge Analytica data breach was a violation of trust, no doubt. But there is clearly a political dimension to the intense, ongoing frenzy it unleashed. The story became an instant scandal because the Trump campaign was part of it.But it was hardly the first time Facebook users had their information unwittingly scooped up by a political campaign.As we've noted in this space, the Obama campaign, apparently with the eager assistance of Facebook itself, managed to gather up data possibly on every user at the time by encouraging people to sign up to the campaign website using their Facebook ID, which gave the campaign not only access to their data, but data on their Facebook friends. Which apparently included every U.S. user at the time.As Obama campaign staffer Carol Davidsen tweeted after the Cambridge story broke, ""Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn't stop us once they realized what we were doing.""This effort was widely known at the time. In fact, campaign officials bragged about it and multiple news outlets wrote glowing stories about the sophistication of the Obama campaign's use of the social media platform to precisely target key campaign messages.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt is true that the Obama campaign was more upfront and honest with those signing up about how they planned to use the data than the ""Digital Life"" app was. But that distinction is meaningless to the tens of millions of their friends who, in both cases, had their Facebook data scraped for political purposes without their knowledge or consent.What's more, unlike the Cambridge data breach, the Obama campaign — as well as Facebook — might have violated campaign laws by making and accepting in-kind donations.Yet even now, no one is pressuring Facebook executives to explain what happened to all that data the Obama campaign collected. No one is calling on Facebook to send messages to its users letting them know if Obama's data mavens Hoovered up their information.And while the press keeps pressuring Facebook executives with questions about Cambridge Analytica, none bothers to ask them about what Facebook was doing in 2012.Yes, 2012 was a long time ago, relatively speaking, but there are nevertheless important questions that still need answering.Namely, is it true that Facebook let the Obama campaign access data in ways that no other organizations could? How many users had their data scraped by the campaign? Did any other groups outside the Obama campaign have access to this data? Where did all the data end up? Do Democrats still have access to it? Are they still using it?If Facebook is going to come clean about its past privacy problems, it can't ignore this part of the story.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Did Facebook Break The Law To Help Obama Win In 2012?Zuckerberg Starts Talking, And Makes Facebook's Problems Even WorseFunny, When Obama Harvested Facebook Data On Millions Of Users To Win In 2012, Everyone Cheered

Yet the rebound pushed the iPhone giant back into positive territory for 2018.Apple is still in the early stages of forming a new base. Keep in mind that the megacap tech was due for a rest after rising more than 50% past a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 back in January 2017.Those who bought shares at that prime buy point could afford to sit tight during the past six months as Apple bounced up and down within a relatively narrow trading range of 150 to 180. During that period, Apple had broken out of a new base, an eight-week cup with handle that featured a 160.97 entry point. The Oct. 27 breakout spurred an 11.9% rally through mid-January of this year, but Apple surrendered all of that gain amid the market's early-February correction.Apple now gets the worst possible E grade for Accumulation/Distribution based on price-and-volume action over the past 13 weeks.

1586,KEY,"U.S. defense giants Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) will be aiming to shoot down Russian and European rivals in the war to win the world's biggest fighter jet contest.XIndia's air force formally asked companies Friday to submit proposals for 110 fighter jets, currently the globe's largest such order.

1600,KEY,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, significant rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses remained a headwind.In fact, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history as its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive surprise of 2.9%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteHowever, activities of Schwab during the second quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the past 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings was revised 1.7% downward to 58 cents. Nevertheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 48.7%.Notably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 17.9% in the past year, outperforming 10.8% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to impact Q2 results.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsAfter an impressive first quarter, in terms of significant market volatility, client activity returned to normalized levels in the second quarter. Nevertheless, Schwab opened 141,000 and 122,000 new brokerage accounts in April and May, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the second quarter is 11,181, which reflects a year-over-year improvement of 6.6%.Thus, despite a sequential slowdown in market volatility in the second quarter, Schwab’s trading revenues are expected to witness a modest improvement, supported by decent growth in brokerage accounts.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in April and May, on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the entire quarter.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the to-be-reported quarter is $3.4 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.5%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $249 billion, which reflects growth of 15.3% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with an improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues is expected to support overall revenue growth in the quarter.

1601,KEY,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 16, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues, rise in assets under management (AUM) and long-term inflows.Moreover, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 2.6%.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteHowever, BlackRock’s business activities and prospects in the to-be-reported quarter did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.64 has decreased marginally over the past 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure reflects a year-over-year improvement of 26.7%.Strong fundamentals have helped shares of the company to gain 15.6% in the past year, outperforming 2.6% growth recorded by the industry.Will the rally in share price continue post Q2 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q2 results.Factors to Impact Q2 ResultsBlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market, given its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the company expects to witness positive active equity flows during the quarter under review. Thus, while negative foreign currency adjustments during the second quarter might have an unfavorable impact on AUM, total AUM is expected to improve, driven by steady inflows. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.44 trillion, which reflects rise of 1.9%, sequentially.Supported by the increase in assets during the to-be-reported quarter, investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 80% of the company’s total revenues, is also expected to witness an improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $3.03 billion, reflecting 13.4% increase year over year.Moreover, performance fees, which is also a major revenue component, is expected to improve during the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fees for the second quarter is $76 million, which represents an improvement of 58.3% from the prior-year quarter.However, consensus estimates for advisory and other revenues show that this component is likely to witness a decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $72 million, which reflects a decline of 1.4% year over year.Thus, while advisory and other revenues are expected to decline, an improvement in the major components of revenues is likely to boost the company’s total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the second quarter is $3.45 billion, which reflects growth of 16.4% year over year.Notably, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, the restructuring of the traditional actively managed equities business, along with its plans for improving product offerings, is expected to lead to further rise in expenses.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted whether BlackRock will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This is because, it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

1602,KEY,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Jul 17. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last reported quarter.Comerica’s first-quarter 2018 results reflected rise in revenues. Also, a strong capital position and improving credit quality were the positives. However, higher expenses and a fall in deposits were the key headwinds.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.2%.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteNow let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts for the to-be-reported quarter:Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Comerica is +1.60%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have been revised slightly downward over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.62 reflects growth of 43.4% year over year.Factors to Drive the ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Rise: Comerica’s net interest income is likely to improve in the to-be-reported quarter supported by expanding net interest margin and a pickup in loan growth, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer.These benefits might partially be offset by a fall in interest earning assets. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects a slight decline in average earnings assets balance to $66 billion on a year-over-year basis.Higher Fee Income: Investment banking performance is expected to be flat during the quarter. Strong equity issuances globally might have been boosted by IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are likely to show improvement. Also, increasing M&As will likely support advisory fees to some extent.Moreover, given the continued momentum in customer activity, in terms of using credit and debit cards, the company might have recorded higher related fees.Therefore, given expectations for rise in both NII and fee income, total revenues are likely to increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the second quarter is $831.9 million, reflecting an improvement of 7.2% year over year.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates.Credit Quality Might Improve: The quarter continued to witness strong credit quality trends. Also, the consensus estimate shows 34.9% and 33.3% decline in non-performing assets and non-performing loans, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BankUnited (BKU  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jul 24.

1605,KEY,"After an impressive performance in the first quarter driven by significant volatility, client activity seems to have returned to normalized levels. Hence, Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading revenues are expected to be relatively stable in second-quarter 2018. As trading revenues are an important part of the bank’s top line, this will likely support to its results slated on Jul 16.The second quarter witnessed further escalation in the trade war and some other geo-political tensions. But these developments were not sufficient to result in a substantial increase in volatility and thus, client activity remained modest.Further, at an investors’ conference in May, BofA CEO Brian Moynihan stated that the company’s trading income is expected to be flat year over year in the second quarter.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Markets segment (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $4.12 billion indicates a decline of 14% from the prior quarter.Here are the other factors that are likely influence BofA’s second-quarter results:Steady net interest income growth: A modest increase in lending — mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — is expected result in improvement in net interest income (NII). A rise in interest rates will provide some support despite flattening of the yield curve in the second quarter.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $1.99 trillion for the second quarter indicates a marginal sequential improvement. This, along with decent lending activities is expected to further boost BofA’s NII in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, management expects NII, on an FTE basis, to decline roughly $120 million owing to the tax act.Muted investment banking performance: Increase in interest rates is likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuance activities. As debt origination fees account for major portion of total investment banking fees for BofA, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.However, strong equity issuances globally are expected to have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, equity underwriting fees are expected to increase for BofA. Further, increasing M&As will likely lead to a slight rise in advisory revenues for the company.BofA’s investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $5 billion reflects a marginal rise on a sequential basis.Slowdown in mortgage banking business: With the refinance boom almost coming to end, a significant support is not expected from this operation. Also, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter as mortgage rates continued to move higher. As BofA hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, mortgage banking is not expected to be a big help for the company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Banking segment (under which mortgage fees are accounted for) revenues of $9.2 billion shows 1.8% rise from the prior quarter.Reduced scope of cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support in the to-be reported quarter. Further, as BofA continues to digitize banking operations, upgrade technology and plans to expand into newer markets, related costs are expected to rise.But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall operating expenses are likely to remain manageable in the second quarter.In other developments, redemption of the trust preferred securities and the extinguishment of the related junior subordinated notes issued by BofA are expected to result in nearly $800 million of charge in the second quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:BofA does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -6.10%.Zacks Rank: BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1606,KEY,"After an impressive first-quarter performance driven by significant volatility, client activity has returned to normalized levels. So, this will likely result in relatively stable trading revenues for JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) in second-quarter 2018. As trading revenues constitute roughly one-fifth of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lend support to its results scheduled to be announced on Jul 13.Unlike the first quarter when higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed, impending U.S.-China trade war and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility, developments like further escalation in the trade war and some other geo-political tensions in the second quarter were not enough to lead to substantial rise in client activity.Further, at an investors’ conference in May, JPMorgan’s head of Corporate and Investment Banking division, Daniel Pinto projected flat year-over-year markets revenues in the second quarter.Nonetheless, similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are expected to render support to the total trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.75 billion reflects an increase of 10% from the year-ago quarter. Notably, per the consensus estimate, fixed income trading revenues will remain flat year over year at $3.22 billion.Apart from this, here are some of the other factors that are anticipated to influence JPMorgan’s second-quarter results:Steady rise in net interest income: A modest improvement in lending — mainly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — will likely lead to an increase in net interest income (NII). A rise in interest rates will provide some support despite flattening of the yield curve in the second quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $2.21 trillion for the second quarter indicates an increase of 1.7% year over year. This along with decent lending activities is projected to boost the company’s NII in the to-be-reported quarter.Subdued investment banking performance: Equity issuances across the globe seem to have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, JPMorgan is expected to record a slight increase in equity underwriting fees in the second quarter.Also, increasing global M&A activities will likely support the company’s advisory fees to some extent. Further, as JPMorgan remains at the top position when it comes to garnering global investment banking fees, this will likely provide the bank a leverage to attract more business.However, rise in rates is likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuance activities. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues to some extent.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment. Further, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter. As JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, the company is expected to witness muted growth in the same.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will not likely be a major support. Also, as JPMorgan is aiming to enter newer markets by opening branches, expenses are likely to remain on the higher side. Further, increased investment in technology to strengthen digital offerings will result in a rise in costs.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:The chances of JPMorgan beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high this time as it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is +1.19%.Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the predictive power of ESP.JPMorgan Chase & Co.

1607,KEY,"The earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks have performed in the second quarter amid uncertainty related to the trade war fears.After impressive first-quarter 2018 results, major bank stocks’ performance lost some steam. The primary reason is the flattening of the yield curve. As such, net interest margin (one of the key metrics for gauging banks’ profitability) is expected to be subdued in the second quarter.Also, growth in trading revenues, which was one of the main supporting factors during the first quarter, is likely to be muted. Though the second quarter witnessed uncertainty mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions, it wasn’t sufficient.Further, investment banking performance is anticipated to be flat. A rise in equity issuances across the globe might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Therefore, equity underwriting fees are projected to improve slightly. Also, increasing M&As will likely support banks’ advisory fees to some extent. These are, however, expected to be more than offset by lower debt origination fees, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities.Dismal mortgage banking performance is also expected to continue in the second quarter amid rising interest rates as mortgage originations and volume declined.Nevertheless, a decent improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer will offer support banks’ interest income while weakness in revolving home equity loans is expected to persist.Further, asset quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Increased investment in technology to strengthen digital offerings and initiatives to expand into newer areas are expected to result in a slight rise in expenses. But, increase in overall non-operating expenses is likely to be manageable.Further, passage of the new law to lessen banks’ regulatory burden and lower tax rates will support bottom-line growth.Hence, major banks on the S&P 500 Index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector'stotal earnings) are expected to witness 8.2% year-over-year earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Yet, this compares unfavorably with 25.4% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Preview article).Picking the Potential WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. So, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement.

1608,KEY,"Following the release of the Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test 2018 (DFAST 2018) results last week, the Federal Reserve approved the capital plans of 34 financial institutions out of the 35 participating (including the U.S. units of foreign banks with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets) in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).However, the capital plan of the U.S. holding company of Germany-based Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) has been rejected by the Fed on qualitative reasons. Notably, the bank’s plan failed to receive consent on flaws in assumptions for forecast of revenues and losses.Moreover, the capital plans of Goldman GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) received conditional consent with their total dividend payouts and stock buybacks to be maintained at the current levels. Additionally, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) plan has been given a green signal with the clause of improving its hypothetical lending risks analysis with other big banks.The Fed’s nod for most of the major U.S. banks reflects stability in the banking system to a great extent.""Even with one-time challenges posed by changes to the tax law, the CCAR results demonstrate that the largest banks have strong capital levels, and after making their approved capital distributions, would retain their ability to lend even in a severe recession,"" said Fed’s vice chairman Randal Quarles.Root of the Capital RulesCurrently authorized under the Dodd-Frank financial-services law, these stress tests were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. During the economic downturn, big financial institutions like Lehman Brothers collapsed, while several others were on the verge of a meltdown. Such a turbulent situation compelled the U.S. government to infuse billions of dollars into credit markets and save the entire financial system from crumbling. Stress tests have been annually conducted since 2009.These major banks, now, have the privilege to raise dividends and buy back shares. This year’s stress test was the toughest, with severe adverse scenario featuring a severe global recession and the U.S. unemployment rate increasing to 10%, along with a steepening Treasury yield curve. Further, changes in tax rates had an adverse impact on banks’ financials as the tax law eliminated some beneficial tax treatments that inclined to increase net income at the time of financial crisis.Under this hypothetical scenario, these banks will incur a loss of $578 million. Notably, the projected losses included $113 billion from credit card loans for the banks, at an equal level with trading and counterparty positions. Also, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio (in aggregate) would fall to 7.9% from an actual 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017. Notably, the figure is well above the 4.5% minimum mark set by regulators.This apart, the Fed requires the big banks to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of at least 3% of their assets and certain other positions.Banks that AcedWells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report), JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) are among the major banks which received the Fed’s green light to raise their dividends or repurchase shares.Among these, M&T Bank currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while all other banks carry a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Since the first round of stress tests, there has been substantial increase in capitals of U.S. firms. The common equity capital ratio has also more than doubled from the 5.2% in first-quarter 2009 to 12.3% in fourth-quarter 2017 of the 35 bank-holding companies which participated in the 2018 CCAR. Such positive results reflect rise in common equity capital from about $800 billion to more than $1.2 trillion during the same period.Recovery on the WayGiven the tax cuts and easing of stringent regulations, banks’ optimism has yielded results. With the capital plan approvals, banks keen to reward shareholders by enhancing the size of their capital-deployment plans (raising dividends and repurchasing shares) have announced respective dividend hikes and share repurchase plans.Nevertheless, the Fed’s approval to increase dividend payment and accelerate the share buyback program will definitely help banks attract more investments, moving ahead.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1609,KEY,"Higher interest rates along with robust loan and deposit growth aid KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report). Given a solid capital position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.However, the company’s significant exposure to risky loan portfolios might curb its growth in the near term. Also, elevated expenses are likely to hurt bottom-line growth.KeyCorp’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has remained stable over the last 30 days. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at the company’s price performance, its shares have gained 10.5% in the past 12 months, underperforming 11.8% rally of the industry.Going by the fundamentals, the company’s revenues have increased at a CAGR of 15.3% over the last four years (2014-2017). Moreover, continued rise in loans and deposits, along with lesser regulations, are expected to continue supporting top-line growth in the quarters ahead.The company is well poised to benefit from the improvement in the rate scenario. Notably, subsequent to the latest Fed rate hike, the company raised its prime lending rate from 4.75% to 5.00%.However, the company continues to have significant exposure to home equity and commercial real estate loans. Despite an improvement in the housing sector, it is likely to pose some challenges for the company in the near term.Further, increasing expenses remain a major concern for the company. Total operating expenses have witnessed a five-year (2013-2017) CAGR of 9.9%, mainly due to rise in personal expenses. Given the company’s investment in its franchise and inorganic growth plans, expenses are likely to remain elevated in the near term.Some better-ranked stocks in the finance space are Lazard Ltd (LAZ  -  Free Report), Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) and East West Bancorp, Inc.

1610,KEY,"The Federal Reserve released the first round of its annual stress test results, mandated by the Dodd-Frank regulation. The findings showed that the 35 largest U.S. banks are well positioned to put more money in dividends, share buybacks and business investments. The banks have sufficient capital balance to withstand severe recession.The results have been announced at a time when the Fed is forging ahead with rate hikes, reflecting an economy that is improving by the day. Banking on such positive developments, investing in sound bank stocks that have passed the litmus test will be judicious.What Are the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests?The Fed started testing banks in 2009, two years after the beginning of the financial crisis that resulted in a recession. The Fed had to test all U.S. bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets, per the Dodd-Frank law enacted by former president Obama in 2010.But the threshold was raised to $100 billion last month by President Trump. These banks are subject to the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) that determines whether they can fund dividend payments and share buybacks amid economic turmoil.   Banks Clear First Round of Fed’s Toughest Annual Stress TestsAll 35 banks that underwent the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests showed that they have enough capital buffers to weather an economic meltdown and recessions modelled by the Fed. These banks can withstand a situation where unemployment rate rises to 10%, an almost 6% increase from the current level; the stock market tanks by two-thirds and home prices plunge by 30%.Banks’ capital scores remained comfortably above regulatory requirements in the first round of the stress tests, even though they had to bear losses due to higher credit card balances and one-time accounting challenges enacted by the recent congressional overhaul.Fed Vice Chairman of Supervision Randal Quarles added that “despite a tough scenario and other factors that affected this year’s test, the capital levels of the firms after the hypothetical severe global recession are higher than the actual capital levels of large banks in the years leading up to the most recent recession”.Banks Are Well Poised to Meet Financial ObligationsAll 35 banks stayed above the 4.5% minimum capital ratio in a severely stressed situation. When it comes to assessing the ability of a bank to meets its financial obligations, State Street Corporation’s (STT  -  Free Report) 5.3% capital ratio turned out to be the lowest, per Fed. Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report) topped the list with 17.6%, followed by UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report) and Banco Santander, S.A. (SAN  -  Free Report) at 16.4% and 15.2%, respectively.The diagram shows all the 35 banks that have cleared the minimum capital ratio to satisfy the Fed’s concern. Fed Rate Hikes Bode Well for BanksWhile the stress test showed that the banks could withstand a downturn, it came at a time when the Fed lifted a key U.S. interest rate for the second time this year and signaled a slightly more aggressive plan to tighten monetary policy in the near term. Interest rates rose again as the U.S. economy gained strength and inflation crawled higher.The Fed, as widely expected, raised its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage points to a range of 1.75% to 2% this month and predicted two additional rate hikes this year. This will take the count to four increases instead of three as planned earlier.Needless to say, higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.5 Biggest GainersGiven the positive trends, we have selected five solid banks that have passed the first round of the stress test. These selected banks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy).

1613,KEY,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was bullish. Strong economic growth, desired inflation and a steady labor market boosted investors’ confidence. Moreover, the recent upswing in oil prices is expected to improve near-term inflation outlook, thereby smoothing the path to rise in interest rates.Mortgage rates also slightly improved to 4.55%, as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers.

Legal hassles continue for major banks. Recently, per a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) has agreed to resolve a consolidated securities fraud class action suit related to the fake-accounts scandal revoked in September 2016. The settlement amount comes to around $480 million.Wells Fargo stated it ""reached an agreement in principle"" with the parties that brought the complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. However, though the deal awaits certain customary conditions and final court approval, the San Francisco-based bank has already fully reserved the amount, as of Mar 31, 2018.Per the filing, “reasonably possible” legal charges could be equivalent to $2.6 billion beyond amount reserved as of Mar 31, 2018. (Read more: Wells Fargo Resolves Sales Scam-Related Suit, To Pay $480M)2. During its Investors’ Day presentation held this week, Wells Fargo came out with impressive expense outlook and expectations of lower impact on earnings from the regulatory cap on assets. The bank also mentioned that it expects to reward its shareholders with higher returns in the long term. It raised the higher end of its payout ratio target to 55-80%, from 55-75% it had set in 2016. However, net interest income, which makes up more than 55% of revenues, is expected to be ‘relatively stable’ in 2018. Management expects that lower earning assets and higher deposit costs might offset benefits from higher interest rates. The bank expects to reduce expenses by $2 billion in 2018, followed by another $2 billion in 2019. It plans to achieve most of these savings by streamlining its lines of businesses along with 300 branch closures.The bank reiterated that it expects total noninterest expenses to be in the range of $53.5-$54.5 billion for 2018, excluding litigation and remediation accruals expenses.Considering Wells Fargo’s involvement in a horde of litigation issues, either due to poor risk control measures or supervision over employees, the Federal Reserve had ordered Wells Fargo to keep its assets under $1.95 trillion in February 2018.At the time, the bank stated that it expects the restriction’s impact on its after tax net income to be about $400 million. However, at the Investors’ Day Wells Fargo’s treasurer, Neal Blinde said that modest growth in loans and deposits balance helped reduce the impact to about $100 million.3. As part of its efforts to do away with less profitable businesses, Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) will sell roughly $17 billion of first and second lien mortgages to DLJ Mortgage Capital Inc., a subsidiary of Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report).

As part of its efforts to expand into newer markets, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) wants to set up a joint-venture brokerage in China. For this, the company is seeking approval from the securities regulator in the country. Gao Li, a spokeswoman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, recently stated that J.P. Morgan Broking (Hong Kong) Ltd., a unit of JPMorgan submitted an application to acquire 51% stake in a Chinese securities venture. The application will be reviewed by the regulator efficiently, Li said.This move by the bank comes after China, in April, pledged to open its financial markets and hence released guidelines giving permission to foreign companies to own a maximum of 51% of their local securities joint ventures. Notably, the country is expected to remove all ownership limits for foreign companies after three years.5.

The company’s revenues (tax equivalent basis) have seen a CAGR of 15.3% over the last four years (2014-2017).Sustained growth in loans and rising interest rates as well as higher fee income will likely continue aiding the top line.

The bank has been witnessing a decline in provision for loan losses over the past several quarters. Further, in 2018, management anticipates net charge-offs rate to be lower than the target range of 40-60 basis points while provisions are expected to rise modestly, given the loan growth.Impressive capital deployment activities: Driven by its capital strength, KeyCorp’s capital deployment activities are impressive. In May, the company announced a 14.3% dividend hike (part of its 2017 capital plan) and it has a share buyback plan in place.Also, the bank has been growing inorganically as well.

It has amassed assets over $417.93 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap ValueMid cap companies have market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. They usually have higher growth prospects than large cap companies and are less volatile than small cap companies. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.30%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.99%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 19% of the portfolio. Consumer Discretionary and Utilities round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.25% of total assets, followed by Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Keycorp (KEY  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.44% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskJKI seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar Mid Value Index before fees and expenses. The Morningstar Mid Value Index measures the performance of stocks issued by mid-capitalization companies.The ETF has lost about -0.60% so far this year and was up about 9.61% in the last one year (as of 05/10/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $143.88 and $168.36.The ETF has a beta of 0.95 and standard deviation of 14.01% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space.

1617,KEY,"Making its debut on 04/02/2007, smart beta exchange traded fund Guggenheim Mid-Cap Core ETF (CZA  -  Free Report) provides investors broad exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor & IndexCZA is managed by Invesco Powershares, and this fund has amassed over $253.11 M, which makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Mid Cap ETFs. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Mid-Cap Core Index.The Zacks Mid-Cap Core Index is comprised of 100 securities selected, based on investment and other criteria, from a universe of mid-capitalization securities including master limited partnerships and American depositary receipts.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.65% for this ETF, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.CZA's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.11%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 32.60% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector; Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Keycorp (KEY  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.14% of the fund's total assets, followed by Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR  -  Free Report) and Regions Financial Corp (RF  -  Free Report).CZA's top 10 holdings account for about 19.92% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has lost about -1.02%, and was up about 11.66% in the last one year (as of 05/05/2018). CZA has traded between $57.99 and $68.99 in the past 52-week period.CZA has a beta of 0.92 and standard deviation of 13.09% for the trailing three-year period.

1618,KEY,"BankUnited, Inc.’s (BKU  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 77 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. Moreover, the bottom line compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 57 cents per share.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and lower provisions. Moreover, the company’s overall loans and deposit balances remained strong. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were the undermining factors.Net income for the quarter was $85.2 million, up from $62.3 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Income Improves, Costs EscalateNet revenues for the quarter were $275.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $265.3 million. Further, the reported figure increased 6.6% year over year.Net interest income for the quarter came in at $247.8 million, increasing 7.5% year over year, led by higher interest income, partially offset by rise in interest expenses.Net interest margin contracted 14 basis points year over year to 3.56%.Non-interest income was $28 million, edging down nearly 1% from the year-ago quarter. The fall was primarily due to lower net income from resolution of covered assets.Non-interest expenses increased 3.4% from the year-ago quarter to $161.8 million, primarily due to rise in employee compensation and benefit costs, depreciation of equipment under operating lease and other non-interest expenses.Credit Quality: Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.20%, decreasing from 0.38% as of Dec 31, 2017. Also, provision for loan losses for the quarter was $3.1 million, down from $12.1 million in the prior-year quarter.However, non-performing loans to total loans was 0.91%, increasing from 0.81% as of Dec 31, 2017.Solid Balance Sheet & Capital RatiosAs of Mar 31, 2018, net loans totaled $21.3 billion, almost in line with the prior quarter’s figure. Total deposits amounted to $22.2 billion, increasing from $21.9 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.As of Mar 31, 2018, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.6%, while Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 13.0%.

Also, return on average stockholders’ equity was 11.28%, up from 10.08% at the end of the prior-year quarter.Our TakeSupported by consistent growth in loans and deposits, BankUnited remains on track for top-line improvement in the future. Also, given a solid liquidity and balance sheet position, the bank is well poised to grow through acquisitions.However, persistently increasing expenses and continued margin pressure (despite increase in interest rates) remain major near-term concerns.BankUnited, Inc.

1621,KEY,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 38 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, this compared favorably with adjusted earnings of 32 cents per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.Improvement in both net interest income and fee income drove results. Further, a decline in provision for credit losses and improving loans acted as tailwinds. However, an increase in expenses was on the downside.Net income from continuing operations was $402 million, up from $296 million registered in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal revenues grew 3.1% year over year to $1.55 billion. However, the figure marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income went up 2.5% year over year to $952 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from low deposit betas and elevated interest rates. Also, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations improved 2 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.15%.Non-interest income was $601 million, reflecting an increase of 4.2% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by an improvement in all components except trust and investment services income, cards and payments income along with other income.Non-interest expenses (excluding notable items) increased 7.9% year over year to $1.01 billion. The rise was due to higher personnel costs, largely due to recent acquisitions as well as accelerated technology investments and higher performance-based compensation.Strong Balance SheetAt the end of the first quarter, average total deposits were $102.56 billion, down 1.2% from the prior quarter. Average total loans were $86.93 billion, up 1.1% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, decreased 2 bps year over year to 0.25%. Provision for credit losses declined 3.2% year over year to $61 million.Further, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.65%, down 7 bps year over year.However, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $881 million, up 1.3% from the prior-year quarter.Capital PositionKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.22% as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 8.51% as of Mar 31, 2017. However, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.84%, up from 10.74% as of Mar 31, 2017.The company’s estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.88% at the end of the quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, KeyCorp repurchased $199 million worth of shares as part of its 2017 capital plan.Our TakeKeyCorp remains well positioned for growth in revenues, given rising rate environment and rise in loan and deposit balances. Improving credit quality and enhanced capital deployment activities are the other positives. Further, the corporate tax rate cut will aid profitability to some extent. However, persistently increasing expenses, owing to investments in franchise and acquisitions, are likely to hurt bottom-line growth. Further, the company's significant exposure toward risky loan portfolios remains a major concern.KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteKeyCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1623,KEY,"Earnings season for banks has already begun and the results released so far by the big names reflect a decent performance. The results till now indicate higher revenues supported by improved loan balances, hike in interest rates and rebound in trading activities. However, lower mortgage income and dismal investment banking performance adversely impacted fee income to some extent.On the cost front, the chance of a significant rise in expenses is low, though a marginal increase in expenses is expected to occur owing to efforts to digitize operations and investment in franchise. Notably, lower tax rates are projected to boost earnings.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in the first quarter are projected to jump 19.2% year over year. This compares favorably with prior quarter’s earnings growth of 2.7%.Therefore, this seems to be the right time to add a few bank stocks in case they beat earnings estimates.Let’s check the factors that are likely to influence the following major banks slated to report first-quarter results on Apr 19, before the opening bell.KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) earnings and revenues are expected to improve in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 38 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of 18.8%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.56 billion indicates 4.1% growth from the prior-year quarter.Driven by loan growth and higher interest rates, the bank’s interest income will likely increase. The consensus estimate for net interest income (NII) (tax equivalent basis) of $948 million for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 2% increase on a year-over-year basis.On the other hand, fee income growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is likely to be muted due to expectations of lower mortgage banking fees, trust and investment services income, and investment banking fees. (Read more: Will Loan Growth, Lower Costs Aid KeyCorp Q1 Earnings?)KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteAnother major bank, BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is expected to report a marginal decline in NII owing to lower net interest margin expectation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.62 billion for the to-be-reported quarter shows 1.6% decline on a sequential basis.Fee income performance is likely to be disappointing as well with rise in insurance fees providing some relief. Total non-interest income is projected to witness a 2.4% fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is $1.20 billion. (Read more: Can Loan Growth & Insurance Fees Aid BB&T Q1 Earnings?)Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 92 cents, which reflects year-over-year rise of 24.3%.

1624,KEY,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), slated to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, is expected to show improvement in net interest income (NII), driven by higher interest rates. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans recorded solid growth year over year, even though the quarter witnessed a modest improvement in lending activities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average total loans of $87.2 billion for the first quarter indicates year-over-year growth of 1.3%. Driven by loan growth, earning assets are also likely to rise. The consensus estimate for average interest earning assets of $123.4 billion for the to-be-reported quarter indicates an increase of 3.1%.Thus, KeyCorp’s NII, one of the main revenue sources, is expected to support earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (tax equivalent basis) of $948 million for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Let’s check out other factors that are expected to influence KeyCorp’s Q1 performance:Muted non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s first-quarter non-interest income will benefit from rise in service charge on deposits as deposit balance is expected to improve in the quarter.However, given lower debt placement activities, investment banking fees are expected to fall. Also, as equity market performance was dismal during the quarter, trust and investment services income is expected to witness a decline.Further, due to lower mortgage originations, growth in mortgage banking fees will likely be muted during the quarter. Therefore, non-interest income growth is expected to be disappointing.Notably, management expects fee income to decline sequentially, given the seasonality in loan fees and corporate-owned life insurance as well as normalized levels of investment banking and debt placement fees.Fall in expenses to lend support: KeyCorp has been diversifying products, reorganizing operations and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. Thus, the company’s overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger-related charges) are expected to be manageable.Also, management will be realizing the majority of remaining $50 million cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal in the first quarter. In fact, KeyCorp anticipates operating expenses to decline sequentially.Asset quality to aid results: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $402 million indicates a plunge of 35.5% year over year. Likewise, the consensus estimate for non-performing loans of $339 million, reflects a decrease of 40.8% from the year-ago quarter.As KeyCorp is likely to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. But overall, this is expected to be manageable.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.95%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of the earnings beat.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 38 cents, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 18.8%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.56 billion indicates 4.3% growth from the prior-year quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few major bank stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

1625,KEY,"Over the last four trading days, performance of banking stocks has been encouraging. Easing U.S.-China trade war tension has provided some respite to investors, infusing overall positivity in the market.Mortgage rates declined this week, hitting 4.4%, along with bond yields, on fears of a trade war. Despite this, investors are apprehensive about parking funds in the housing market, thanks to the volatility in the financial world. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time gainers.Further, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield shrunk during the week, as demand for safe-haven assets increased due to the political tension, only to bounce back near to 2.82% as fears of the trade war waned.Notably, mortgage applications plunged last week, per the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. In addition, the refinance share of mortgage activity came in at 38.5% of all applications.Though economic data might be affected marginally due to slapping of trade tariffs by the United States and China, the first-quarter GDP is expected to grow moderately and consumer spending is anticipated to bear minimal brunt. Therefore, positive numbers and anticipations of an improving job market might lead to rise in housing demand.Regarding company-specific news related to banks, streamlining operations and steady capital-deployment activities persisted over the last four trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Mar 9, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1.

1627,KEY,"After reporting 20% year-over-year rise in investment banking revenues in 2017, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), expects further growth in this segment in 2018 on the back of improved activity in the emerging markets.In an interview with Reuters, Miguel Azevedo, head of investment banking in the Middle East and Africa said that bond sales, M&As and trading activities are likely to take an upswing in Nigeria, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, in turn spurring the bank’s investment banking revenues.Per growth projections made by the World Bank for 2018, the Middle East and North African regions are expected to witness a 3% growth rate. Improved condition of oil prices and expectations of development in economic reforms have made the region an attractive opportunity for the private banks to tap on.Notably, the region is undergoing a turnaround from traditional IPOs or debt rising toward private M&A deals and placements, which guarantees strong investment banking performance. This has increased competition among the several lenders present there.     In April 2017, Citigroup was granted the license to provide services like investment banking, debt and equity capital markets, securities and research capabilities to local and institutional clients in Saudi Arabia. Last month, the bank held its first board meeting in the country marking its return after 13 years of absence.Citigroup has been building upon its Saudi investment banking business with new hires.Also, Azevedo reflected views on growing opportunities in Nigeria, as the country is likely to return to the bond markets in 2018. In November 2017, a $3 billion two-part international bond issue was managed by Citigroup and Standard Chartered. He also added Egypt to the list on account of increase in number of IPOs.Citigroup, with its global footprint and attractive core business, seems to be well poised for growth. Also, improving domestic economy amid the rising rate environment, as well as anticipated potential ease of regulations under President Trump’s administration, the bank is likely to continue delivering strong results in quarters ahead.Shares of Citigroup have gained 30.9% over the past year, outperforming 20.2% rally for the industry it belongs to.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Adjusted earnings per share of 86 cents for the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. Moreover, the bottom line compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 59 cents per share.Results were primarily driven by an increase in both net interest income and non-interest income. Also, lower provisions supported results to quite an extent. Moreover, the company witnessed strong growth in loans and deposits. However, higher expenses remained an undermining factor.After taking into consideration the impact of a discrete income tax benefit and related professional fees, net income for the quarter came in at $417.8 million or $3.79 per share.Adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 for 2017 also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.39.

The rise was primarily driven by a significant increase in net gain on sale of loans.Non-interest expenses increased 3.2% from the year-ago quarter to $161.3 million, primarily due to a rise in employee compensation and benefits costs, deposit insurance expense and professional fees.Credit Quality: Mixed BagAs of Dec 31, 2017, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.38%, increasing from 0.13% as of Dec 31, 2016.

Also, given a solid liquidity and balance sheet position, the bank is well poised to grow through acquisitions.However, persistently increasing expenses and continued margin pressure (despite increase in interest rates) remain major near-term concerns.BankUnited, Inc.

Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income.

However, higher expenses and a decline in loans balance remained major headwinds.KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 36 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Easing margin pressure on rising rates was witnessed in the quarter. Moreover, revenues improved on a year-over-year basis aided by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in August 2016). On the other hand, decrease in loans was on the downside.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Also, it was 23.6% above the prior-year quarter. The figure excluded one-time net costs of $270 million or 72 cents per share related to the tax reform and other significant non-recurring items.Higher net interest income (reflecting rise in interest rates), fee income and a decline in operating expenses supported the results. Also, improvement in assets under custody and administration and assets under management (AUM) acted as a tailwind. However, lower trading servicing fees was an undermining factor.After considering several notable items, net income available to common shareholders came in at $334 million or 89 cents per share compared with $557 million or $1.43 per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseRevenues, on a GAAP basis totaled $2.85 billion, increasing 12.5% from the prior-year quarter.

All components of fee income showed improvement except total trading services revenues.On an operating basis, non-interest expenses were $2 billion, down 6.8% on a year-over-year basis.

1630,KEY,"SunTrust Banks' (STI  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.09 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05. Also, the figure was up 21% year over year.Results were primarily driven by a rise in revenues (supported by higher interest rates), stable adjusted expenses and lower provision for credit losses. Also, improving asset quality was a tailwind. However, a decline in loan and deposit balances was the undermining factor.After considering one-time discrete gains including tax reform related benefit, net income available to common shareholders was $710 million, up 58% from the prior-year quarter.For 2017, adjusted earnings of $4.09 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06.

The figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For 2017, total revenues (FTE basis) were up 4% from the prior year to $9.13 billion. The figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.40 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 7% year over year to $1.47 billion. The rise was attributable to higher earning asset yields.On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 17 basis points (bps) to 3.17%, mainly reflecting higher earning asset yields and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. This was partly offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.Non-interest income was $833 million, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. The modest rise was largely driven by an increase in commercial real estate related income and wealth management-related income.Non-interest expenses rose 9% from the year-ago quarter to $1.52 billion. The increase was mainly due to several non-recurring items. After excluding those, operating expenses were relatively stable.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $741 million as of Dec 31, 2017, down 19% from prior-year quarter. Non-performing loans fell 12 bps year over year to 0.47% of total loans held for investment.Further, the rate of net charge-offs decreased 9 bps year over year to 0.29% of total average loans held for investment. Also, provision for credit losses decreased 22% from the year-ago quarter to $79 million.Strong Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, SunTrust had total assets of $206 billion while shareholders’ equity was $25.2 billion, representing nearly 12% of total assets.As of Dec 31, 2017, loans held for investments declined 1% on a sequential basis to $143.2 billion.

Easing margin pressure and initiatives to enhance efficiency are likely to support the company’s revenues.

1631,KEY,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 36 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, this compares favorably with 31 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter.Easing margin pressure on rising rates was witnessed in the quarter. Moreover, revenues improved on a year-over-year basis aided by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in August 2016). Further, a decline in provision for credit losses and improving deposits acted as tailwinds. On the other hand, decrease in loans was on the downside.Including merger-related charges and the impact of tax reform, net income from continuing operations came in at $181 million or 17 cents per share. This was 15% down from $213 million or 20 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.For 2017, earnings of $1.12 per share lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31. However, earnings were up 63.8% year over year. Further, net income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion, reflecting a 59.3% jump from 2016.Higher Rates Drive Revenues, Expenses Remain StableTotal revenues grew 2.7% year over year to $1.61 billion. Further, revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58 billion.For 2017, revenues increased 25.6% year over year to $6.31 billion. Also, revenues came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.25 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income went up marginally year over year to $952 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from low deposit betas and elevated interest rates which got partially offset due to the change in funding mix into certificates of deposit. However, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations declined 3 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.09%.Non-interest income was $656 million, reflecting an increase of 6.1% from the year-ago quarter. A rise in investment banking and debt placement fees, operating lease income and other leasing gains, and consumer mortgage income primarily drove the increase. However, it was partially offset by a decline in other income.Non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) remained unchanged year over year at $1.01 billion. The cost savings from the First Niagara acquisition was offset by expenses relating to investments and acquisitions, including Cain Brothers and higher operating lease expense.Loans Decline Marginally & Deposits RiseAt the end of the fourth quarter, average total deposits were $103.8 billion, up 0.7% from the prior quarter. However, average total loans were $86 billion, down 0.9% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, decreased 10 bps year over year to 0.24%. Provision for credit losses declined 25.8% year over year to $49 million.Further, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.62%, down 17 bps year over year.However, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $877 million, up 2.2% from the prior-year quarter.Capital Ratios ImproveKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.23% as of Dec 31, 2017, up from 8.09% as of Dec 31, 2016. In addition, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.93% versus 10.89% as of Dec 31, 2016.The company’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 10.08% at the end of the quarter, up from 9.54% as of Dec 31, 2016.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, KeyCorp repurchased $199 million worth of shares as part of its 2017 capital plan.Our TakeKeyCorp remains well positioned for growth in revenues given a rising rate environment and a rise in loan and deposit balances. Improving credit quality and enhanced capital deployment activities are the other positives. Further, the corporate tax rate cut will aid profitability to some extent. However, elevated expenses owing to investments in franchise and acquisitions are likely to hurt bottom-line growth.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteKeycorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1632,KEY,"We certainly have new Q4 earnings data to pass along to our readers ahead of the bell this morning, but being Thursday we also have weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Beyond this, we also see new reads on Housing Starts and the Philly Fed survey.A wild week-over-week swing in Initial Jobless Claims: -41K last week to a multi-decade low 220K. This follows the previous week’s spike up to 261K — both of which are outside the 225K-250K of the last 100 weeks or so. In fact, this 220K number is the lowest new claims number since Jim Croce was putting out hit songs on AM radio.That said, consider that these types of figures are susceptible to seasonal issues such as hiring during holiday shopping season. We won’t spend too much brain wattage trying to explain this drastic drop of more than 40,000 jobless claims in one week; future revisions should help iron these numbers out. Continuing claims were up last week: from 1.876 million the previous week to 1,952 million this week.Housing Starts posted a precipitous drop as well: -8.2% is 5 1/2 times worse than the -1.5% drop in starts analysts had been expecting, with a total of 1.192 million seasonally adjusted annualized new housing starts for the month of December. Revisions for November look to have been ratcheted down about -0.3%. Again, we might be looking a seasonality affecting these results; snowstorms in the South — as far as Florida — might have something to do with December’s big drop here.The Philly Fed survey — an economic production read of the U.S.’s 6th largest city — also underperformed expectations, though not by nearly as much: a read of 22.2 is beneath the 25 estimate for the month of January. This is not really a disappointment, however; Philly Fed numbers are historically volatile month by month, so being in the ballpark — and comfortably in positive territory — should suffice for now.The return rate on the 10-year bond has now crossed the 2.6% threshold, taking out the most recent top from March of last year, now going back to the highest U.S. 10-year bond yield since 2014. We will check for resistance points above this current read.Q4 Earnings: Banking IndustryThe Q4 earnings results keep pouring in from U.S. banks this week. Here are a few we are focused on:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rate Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of 84 cents per share beat by 7 cents, on revenues of $9.50 billion which easily outpaced the $9.2 billion expected.

1635,KEY,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for KeyCorp. Rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank. Though flatter yield curve offsets the benefits to some extent, pressure on KeyCorp’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017. Further, the quarter witnessed growth in its consumer loan portfolio as a result of a rise in consumer confidence.Moreover, President Trump’s success with the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter and is likely to support KeyCorp’s fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.58 billion indicates a 1.9% year-over-year improvement for the to-be-reported quarter.Last quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Lower credit cost, an increase in fee income, and improving loans and deposits were among the positives. However, higher operating expenses were on the downside.Activities of KeyCorp during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 36 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 16.1%.Notably, KeyCorp’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 17.8% in the past three months, outperforming the 13.8% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are dim. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.33%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending, mostly on the consumer front, is likely to perk up interest income. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be $966 million, up 1.9% year over year. For 2017, management expects net interest income in the range of $3.8-$3.9 billion.Modest non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s fourth-quarter non-interest income will benefit from increasing investment banking income, primarily driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. Also, as the equity markets performed fairly well during the quarter, trust and investment services income is expected to witness a rise.Nevertheless, due to lower mortgage originations, growth in mortgage banking fees is likely to be rather muted during the quarter. Therefore, non-interest income is projected to record a marginal improvement.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been constantly diversifying products, reorganizing operations and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. As a result of this, we expect the company’s overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger-related charges) to be manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support the bottom line marginally.Asset quality to worsen: As KeyCorp is projected to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $570 million and non-performing loans of $530 million, reflect a rise of 2.5% each from the last quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It is slated to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18.

1636,KEY,"Year-long efforts to fulfill one of the major promises made by President Trump during elections have finally begun bearing fruits. The U.S. Senate passed an amended tax bill on early Saturday morning, which boosted investors’ confidence and led the stock market to rally on Monday.One of the major changes proposed in the tax bill is a significant drop in the corporate tax rate — from 35% to 20%. This is likely to trigger confidence in the markets and spur economic growth by attracting investments from the companies along with increasing jobs.However, the lower income groups are likely to see these changes as a downside. The bill repeals individual mandate in Obamacare, which will leave millions of people uninsured by 2027. Further, people are dubious that the last-minute changes might have left space for the accountants and lawyers to take advantage.Nonetheless, the bill has successfully passed through the second stage and will be presented to a conference committee where representatives from the House and Senate will come together to draft the final bill.A Narrow WinThe Senate was successful in approving the bill by just two votes, with no support from the Democrats.In order to win confidence of some Republicans who were being doubted to vote for the bill, several end-moment changes were made. Yet, one of the Republicans, Senator Bob Corker, stood with the Democrats reflecting his concerns over the burden the proposed bill is likely to create on future generations through increase in public debt.Changes That Helped Get the MajorityHandwritten changes between the lines have been made hastily on the official copy with an aim to get the bill passed through.Some of the major changes are in reference to pass-through businesses like partnerships, popular with real estate developers. Relief was provided by reducing the percentage of tax deduction for such businesses by 2%.Another change was with regard to state and local property tax deductible. The senate took back its previous proposal of ending the deductibility and agreed to make it up to $10,000 as agreed by the House.Further, alternative minimum tax will now be adjusted for individuals and maintained as it is for the corporates, in place of being fully revoked.Why the Hurry?Upon failure of the efforts to repeal Obamacare and delay in fulfillment of promises, Trump was gradually losing confidence of the Americans.With the mid-term elections coming up in 2018, the President sees this tax overhaul as an opportunity to win votes and maintain the majority in the Congress. Thus, he has given his supporters time till the end of 2017, to present the final copy.What Comes Next? Having been amended to win the majority, there are quite some differences in the copies approved by the House and the Senate. Republicans would now sit together and agree upon changes in a conference committee after which the bill would be again presented to both the houses for vote.However, one major rule must be addressed before the bill is passed. A Republican tax bill is allowed to increase the fiscal deficit by $1.5 trillion in the first 10 years only. The Senate backed bill was expected to add $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years.Why Bank Stocks RalliedAll things apart, banks have seemed to come into the spotlight breaking their records, on expectations of higher earnings on the back of lower taxes.In fact, investors’ sentiments have been positive of late due to the to-be Fed Chair, Jerome Powell’s positive remarks on interest rate movement.On Monday, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) gained more than 2%. Further, shares of M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report) and KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) rose nearly 4%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.

The revised quarterly dividend now comes in at $0.105 per share versus the previous figure of $0.095.

Revenues witnessed a CAGR of 5.1%, over the last five years (2012–2016), with the trend continuing in first nine months of 2017.The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 25.16% (against 5.99% industry average) indicates constant upward momentum in revenues.Credit Quality: Improving credit quality continues to be a growth catalyst at KeyCorp. The bank has been witnessing a decline in provision for loan losses over the past several quarters. For 2017, management anticipates the net charge-offs (NCOs) rate to be lower than the target range, while provisions are expected to modestly exceed NCOs, given the loan growth.Stock is Undervalued: KeyCorp has a P/E ratio and P/B ratio of 13.84x and 1.38x compared with the industry’s average of 14.77x and 1.43x, respectively. Based on these ratios, the stock seems undervalued.However, the company’s shares have gained 3.4% in the last six months against 10.2% growth for the industry it belongs to.Stocks to ConsiderShares of Stifel Financial (SF  -  Free Report) have gained more than 16% over the past six months.

1638,KEY,"BankUnited, Inc. (BKU  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 62 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Moreover, the bottom line increased 31.9% from the year-ago-quarter.Results were primarily driven by an increase in both net interest income and non-interest income. Also, the company witnessed strong growth in loans and deposits. However, higher expenses hurt results to quite an extent. Further, an increase in provisions was an undermining factor. It is probably due to these negatives that the shares of the company declined nearly 1.6% following the release.Net income for the quarter increased 33.3% year over year to $67.8 million.Revenues Improve, Costs IncreaseNet revenues for the quarter came in at $294.6 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $273.5 million. Further, the reported figure increased 19.4% year over year.Net interest income climbed 8.8% year over year to $241.3 million, led by higher interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expenses.Net interest margin decreased 7 basis points year over year to 3.62%.

1640,KEY,"Most banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of top-line strength and lower provisions. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, the results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing significantly. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing.

Also, the figure was up 16% year over year.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and a slight fall in operating expenses. Also, stable loan balance and an increase in deposits supported the results. However, a rise in provision for credit losses and lower non-interest income (mainly owing to mortgage banking woes) were the headwinds.Net income available to common shareholders was $512 million, up 12% from the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Income Growth Offsets Higher CostsTotal revenues (FTE basis) for the quarter grew 4% from the prior-year period to $2.31 billion. The figure was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.29 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 9% year over year to $1.47 billion. The rise was attributable to growth in average earning assets and higher earning asset yields.On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 19 basis points (bps) to 3.15%, reflecting higher earning asset yields and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. This was partly offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.Non-interest income was $846 million, down 5% from the prior-year quarter. The fall was largely due to lower mortgage related income, partially offset by a rise in investment banking income.Non-interest expenses were down 1% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion. The fall was mainly due to a lower outside processing and software costs.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $792 million as of Sep 30, 2017, down 22% from prior-year quarter.

1644,KEY,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, scheduled on Oct 19, are expected to show a decline in net interest income (NII). While this could majorly affect its earnings, an improvement in revenues from other segments should offset the adverse impact on earnings.On a sequential basis, the quarter witnessed steady deceleration in home equity loan portfolio, while demand for commercial and industrial, and consumer loans rose. This is expected to lead to a rise in KeyCorp’s loan balance during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average loans of $87.3 billion reflects nearly 1% increase from the prior quarter.Further, KeyCorp is projected to record a 1.3% rise in average earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $121.3 billion.Despite these positive factors, KeyCorp is expected to witness a fall in NII owing to flatter yield curve for the major part of the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (tax equivalent basis) of $963 million shows a 2.4% decline on a sequential basis.Other Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsModest non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s third-quarter non-interest income will be positively impacted by increasing investment banking income, mainly driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. Also, trust and investment services income is anticipated to have risen as the performance of equity markets was relatively decent during the quarter.However, growth in mortgage banking fees is expected to be relatively muted during the quarter owing to lower mortgage originations. Therefore, non-interest income is projected to record a marginal improvement.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been consistently streamlining operations, diversifying products and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. This is expected to keep overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support the bottom line marginally.Asset quality to worsen: As KeyCorp is projected to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $602 million shows 8.3% increase from the last quarter. Also, non-performing loans is projected to be $560 million, a rise of 10.5% sequentially.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict that KeyCorp will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it does not have right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.22%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has remained stable over the last 30 days at 35 cents, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 16.9%.

1648,KEY,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) remains on track to improve its financials through GEAR Up initiatives. Also, the company reported rising fee income despite a sluggish market. Its steady capital deployment activities continue to enhance shareholder value. However, Comerica’s exposure to commercial loans remains a headwind.The company is well poised to grow with the help of its revenue and efficiency enhancing initiatives or GEAR Up initiatives. This is expected help the company achieve annual pre-tax income of about $270 million by year-end 2018. Further, Comericaseeks to achieve $125 million cost savings target for 2017.The company has reported increased non-interest income over the last two years, supported by cross-sell opportunities, including wealth management products such as fiduciary and brokerage services. Further, management expects 4-6% increase in fee income in 2017 through modest growth in treasury management and card fees, and wealth management products.Also, Comerica’s capital strength can be judged from its capital deployment activities. It has a share repurchase plan of up to $605 million for a four-quarter period (ending second-quarter 2018) in progress. Also, as part of its 2017 capital plan, the company raised its common stock dividend by 15% in July 2017. Further, these activities look sustainable as Comerica’s debt/equity ratio and dividend payout ratio compare favorably with the broader industry.However, Comerica’s significant exposure to commercial loans (nearly 64% of the total loans) keeps us apprehensive. If the housing sector weakens, it would adversely impact the company’s financials.Some stocks in the finance space worth considering are PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

1649,KEY,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.2% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.KeyCorp's Q2 Earnings in Line, Revenues & Expenses RiseKeyCorp’s second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Results were supported by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in Aug 2016) and higher interest rates. On the other hand, higher operating expenses and increase in provision for credit losses were the downsides. Notably, the company witnessed marginal loan growth while deposit balances declined.Including merger-related charges of $43 million, net income from continuing operations came in at $393 million, up significantly from $193 million in the prior-year quarter.First Niagara Deal Continues to Drive Revenues, Expenses RiseTotal revenue surged 52.1% year over year to $1.64 billion. Also, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income jumped 63.1% year over year to $987 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from the First Niagara acquisition, a rise in earning asset balances and ongoing business activities. Also, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations grew 54 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.30%.Non-interest income (excluding merger related charges) was $653 million, an increase of 38.1% from the year-ago quarter. A rise in all fee income components drove the surge.Non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) jumped 34.7% year over year to $951 million due to a rise in both personnel as well as non-personnel expenses. The quarter recorded a modest year-over-year fall in merger-related charges.Loans Rise Marginally, Deposits DeclineAt the end of the second quarter, average total deposits were $102.8 billion, down nearly 1% from the prior quarter. However, average total loans were $86.5 billion, up 0.4% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, increased 3 bps year over year to 0.31%. Provision for credit losses increased 26.9% year over year to $66 million. Further, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $870 million, up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter.However, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.64%, down 39 bps year over year.Capital Ratios DeteriorateKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.56% as of Jun 30, 2017, down from 9.95% as of Jun 30, 2016. In addition, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.79% versus 11.41% as of Jun 30, 2016.The company’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 9.97% at the end of the quarter, down from 11.10% as of Jun 30, 2016.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, KeyCorp repurchased $94 million worth of shares as part of its 2016 capital plan.2017 OutlookManagement expects loan growth to exceed deposit growth with average loans growing in the low end of the $87–$88 billion range. Moreover, average deposits are expected to be in the range of $102.5–$103 billion.Further, net interest income is anticipated to increase and be in the range of $3.8–$3.9 billion. This is based on the assumption of no more rate hikes in 2017 and purchase accounting accretion trending lower.Purchase accounting accretion is expected to decline by $5 million each in the remaining two quarters of 2017, leading to accretion of nearly $100 million for the remaining half of the year.Non-interest income is expected to be in the range of $2.35–$2.45 billion, as the company continues to drive growth from its core businesses and the acquisition.KeyCorp expects operating expenses (excluding merger-related charges) to be in the range of $3.7–$3.8 billion. This includes the impact of merchant services and the HelloWallet acquisition.Further, cost savings (related to the First Niagara deal) of $450 million are anticipated to be reached by early 2018.Given the increase in cost savings target from the First Niagara deal, management expects a proportional rise in merger related charges from original projection of $550 million.Management expects the First Niagara deal to result in earnings accretion of approximately 5% in 2017. Also, management projects achieving $300 million worth of incremental revenues from synergies generated by the acquisition. This is likely to lower the company’s cash efficiency by 3% and improve return on tangible common equity by 2%.Net charge-offs to average loans are anticipated to stay below the target range of 40–60 bps. However, the company expects relatively higher provisions.The effective tax rate (GAAP basis) is likely to increase to 26–28%.Thus, in the long run, management expects to continue to generate positive operating leverage, lower the cash efficiency ratio to below 60% and produce a return on tangible common equity of 13–15%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter.KeyCorp Price and Consensus  KeyCorp Price and Consensus | KeyCorp QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a C. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated also a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

1650,KEY,"Over the last five trading days, investors’ pessimistic stance continued for the banking stocks. Release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting indicated a divide over the timing of interest rate hikes. The primary reason for this is the expectation of inflation staying below the Fed’s targeted level of 2% for an extended period.While banks, at present, are reaping benefits from higher rates (easing margin pressure and increase in interest income), it now seems uncertain when the next rate hike will occur. This is perhaps one of the reasons that affected investors’ confidence in the banking stocks to some extent.Also, disbanding of President Donald Trump’s American Manufacturing Council and the Strategy & Policy Forum indicate continued disruptions happening in the White House. Though this development is not likely to directly affect several proposed policy initiatives that are expected to strengthen the economy, investors now seem to be concerned over the timing.Apart from these macro factors, banks continue to reel from litigation and regulatory probes. Legal headwinds pertaining to business malpractices in the pre-crisis period persist.On the other hand, banks are intending to boost profitability through streamlining strategies. Also, with an aim to focus more on diversifying revenue base, banks are increasing market share in lucrative sectors.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Aug 11, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

A lawsuit has been filed in the federal court in Manhattan by three public pension funds against six major banks. In the suit filed by the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, Orange County Employees' Retirement System and Sonoma County Employees' Retirement Association, the banks have been accused of collaborating and conspiring to remove competition from the stock lending market.The accused banks are Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG.In the stock lending market, investors can sell a stock without owning it through a process called short selling. Investors or firms borrow stock with the help of agents by paying a fee and then sell it expecting to buy it again in the future at a lower price.Some upstart lending platforms were developed to help various borrowers and lenders interact directly without the use of middlemen.However, the above mentioned banks have been accused of trying to boycott and hence block the development of such lending platforms over the years. This was done to remove competition from the lending market and thereby charge higher fee from borrowers who wanted to engage in short selling. The act is in violation of the federal antitrust law.Moreover, in order to prevent borrowers from going to other places in the market to get better prices, the banks had created a lending platform of their own called EquiLend LLC. It is through this platform that the banks have been trying to develop anticompetitive strategies in the market to safeguard their interests.3. Capital One Financial Corp.

Higher yields on loans and investment securities led to the margin expansion.Non-interest income was $29.9 million, up 3.5% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily driven by an increase in service charges and lease financing.Non-interest expenses increased 11.3% from the year-ago quarter to $160.4 million due to a rise in all the components, except other non-interest expense.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.24%, up from 0.13% as of Dec 31, 2016.

Also, return on average stockholders’ equity was 10.33%, up from 9.83% as of Jun 30, 2016.Our TakeBankUnited’s revenue growth is commendable. Also, the company’s consistent growth in loans and deposits, and higher profitability ratios are impressive. This testifies that BankUnited is well positioned to grow organically and through acquisitions, given its strong balance sheet position.However, exposure to risky loans and continued margin pressure, due to a liability-sensitive balance sheet, could hurt the company’s financials.BankUnited, Inc.

1654,KEY,"People's United Financial Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2015 results on Thursday, Jul 16.Last quarter, this financial savings and loan institution witnessed more than10% year-over-year rise in earnings, while at the same time managing to beat estimates. Results were aided by higher revenue, partially offset by increased expenses and provisions.Will People's United fail to impress in the upcoming release after combating the challenges witnessed by the industry in the quarter? Let's see what factors might have influenced the earnings report this time around.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsIncreasing commercial real estate and lending activities from the improving economy is likely to contribute to People’s United’s revenue growth. Notably, the company has a track record of positive loan growth (annualized) for the past 18 consecutive quarters. While continuity of such a trend is likely to drive net interest income in the second quarter, we remain cautious at the same time. We expect to witness a rise in provisions during the quarter given the rapidly growing and diversifying loan portfolio.Also, net interest margin is predicted to remain under pressure, owing to lower yield on new loans, given the current low rate environment.Additionally, bank service charges will continue to be impacted due to certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.On a positive note, as reaffirmed by the company during its first-quarter earnings call conference, growth in net interest income from its originated portfolio exceeding lost accretion on the acquired portfolio will likely continue to be a driving factor for subsequent quarters.Also, commercial banking lending fees is likely to get a boost due to moderate growth in commercial prepayment activity in commercial real estate.We believe the quarterly results are likely to reflect reducing expenses.  This is because increase in expenses owing to seasonality in the first quarter is not likely to repeat in the second quarter. Further, as previously announced, the company intends to close around 10 branches in the remainder of this year and plans to reduce real estate costs by consolidating other facilities. Such efforts are likely to reflect in the company’s expense base.Activities of People's United during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained stable at 21 cents per share over the last 7 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that People's United is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 21 cents.Zacks Rank: People's United’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise call.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:KeyCorp. (KEY  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +3.57% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. It is expected to report its second-quarter results on Jul 16.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has an earnings ESP of +1.35% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

1656,KEY,"KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.KeyCorp’s shares fell nearly 2.4% in pre-market trading, reflecting investors’ concern over rising provision for credit losses. Notably, the price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better idea about how investors accepted the results.Results were supported by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in Aug 2016) and higher interest rates. On the other hand, higher operating expenses and increase in provision for credit losses were the downsides. Notably, the company witnessed marginal loan growth while deposit balances declined.Including merger-related charges of $43 million, net income from continuing operations came in at $393 million, up significantly from $193 million in the prior-year quarter.First Niagara Deal Continues to Drive Revenues, Expenses RiseTotal revenue surged 52.1% year over year to $1.64 billion. Also, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income jumped 63.1% year over year to $987 million. The rise was attributable to benefits from the First Niagara acquisition, a rise in earning asset balances and ongoing business activities. Also, taxable-equivalent net interest margin from continuing operations grew 54 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.30%.Non-interest income (excluding merger related charges) was $653 million, an increase of 38.1% from the year-ago quarter. A rise in all fee income components drove the surge.Non-interest expenses (excluding merger related charges) jumped 34.7% year over year to $951 million due to a rise in both personnel as well as non-personnel expenses. The quarter recorded a modest year-over-year fall in merger-related charges.Loans Rise Marginally, Deposits DeclineAt the end of the second quarter, average total deposits were $102.8 billion, down nearly 1% from the prior quarter. However, average total loans were $86.5 billion, up 0.4% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagNet loan charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans, increased 3 bps year over year to 0.31%. Provision for credit losses increased 26.9% year over year to $66 million. Further, KeyCorp’s allowance for loan and lease losses was $870 million, up 1.9% from the prior-year quarter.However, non-performing assets, as a percentage of period-end portfolio loans, other real estate owned properties assets and other nonperforming assets were 0.64%, down 39 bps year over year.Capital Ratios DeteriorateKeyCorp's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.56% as of Jun 30, 2017, down from 9.95% as of Jun 30, 2016. In addition, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.79% versus 11.41% as of Jun 30, 2016.The company’s estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 9.97% at the end of the quarter, down from 11.10% as of Jun 30, 2016.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, KeyCorp repurchased $94 million worth of shares as part of its 2016 capital plan.Our TakeRestructuring initiatives undertaken by KeyCorp will be supported by its robust balance-sheet position. The company’s financials will continue to benefit from the synergies of the First Niagara transaction. Further, with gradual rise in interest rates and increasing loan demand, margin pressure is expected to ease in the coming quarters.However, increased dependence on home equity and commercial real estate loans raises the exposure of the company’s profits to these avenues.KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteKeycorp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1658,KEY,"Earnings season for the banks has already begun and the results released so far by the big banks reflect a challenging second-quarter 2017. Despite hikes in interest rates by the Fed (twice this year), banks seem to be struggling to improve their net interest margin, owing to lower treasury yields.Other headwinds include soft capital market businesses and dismal performance of the investment banking business. Also, modest rise in mortgage origination is expected to hurt mortgage banking revenues.On the other hand, loan demand improved on a sequential basis. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are expected to increase, while growth in consumer loans remained soft. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.On the cost front, the chance of a significant rise in expenses is low, though a marginal increase in expenses could occur owing to digitization. As cost-saving efforts continue supporting the bottom-line performance, overall expenses are expected to remain manageable in the quarter.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in second quarter are projected to grow 4.5% year over year.So, this is the right time to add a few banking stocks in case they beat earnings estimates.Our quantitative model offers some insights into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model, in order to be confident of an earnings beat, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.

It is expected to witness an increase in net interest income. However, legal and professional expenses are expected to be slightly higher in the quarter due to ongoing compliance costs.

1659,KEY,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, revenue synergies from the First Niagara deal (completed in Aug 2016) and lower provision for credit losses helped KeyCorp outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher operating expenses were a headwind.Analysts seem to be optimistic about KeyCorp’s prospects as the company’s second-quarter earnings estimates increased 3% in the last 30 days. The company boasts a decent earnings surprise history, delivering an average beat of 2.1% in the trailing four quarters.KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteDriven by the strong fundamentals, the company’s share price increased 5.4% in the three months ended Jun 30, 2017, outperforming the Zacks categorized Major Banks industry’s rally of 4%.Will the stock’s rally continue post second-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Our proven model doesn’t conclusively predict that KeyCorp will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as it does not have right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 34 cents.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsImproving rates should support net interest income (NII) growth: During the quarter, loan demand improved moderately. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, loans grew on a sequential basis during the second quarter. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are anticipated to increase, while consumer loans might fall. This, coupled with higher interest rates should lead to NII growth.Modest non-interest income growth: We believe KeyCorp’s second-quarter non-interest income will be positively impacted by increasing investment banking income, driven by slightly higher debt placement fees. However, mortgage production is expected to be relatively weak during the quarter.Decline in expenses should support profitability: KeyCorp has been consistently streamlining operations, diversifying products and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. This is expected to keep overall expenses (excluding merger related charges) manageable. Also, management expects cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal to support bottom line marginally.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming announcements.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

1660,KEY,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. The earnings season has kick started and this time, banks are expected to be hurt by a tough operating backdrop. This seems to be one of the primary reasons for investors’ pessimistic stance.A number of factors including weak trading and investment banking activities, lower-than-expected interest rates and lesser demand for refinancing activities during the quarter must be weighing on investors’ mind. All these are expected to hurt banks’ revenue growth to some extent. With expense reduction not likely to be a major support, there is less chance of impressive growth in the banks’ bottom line.Nonetheless, the last five trading sessions witnessed streamlining efforts.

1661,KEY,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KEY due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.KeyCorp Q1 Earnings In Line; Revenues & Costs UpKeyCorp first-quarter 2018 earnings of 38 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, this compares favorably with adjusted earnings of 32 cents per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.Improvement in both net interest income and fee income drove results. Further, a decline in provision for credit losses and improving loans acted as tailwinds. However, an increase in expenses was on the downside.Net income from continuing operations was $402 million, up from $296 million registered in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Improve, Expenses RiseTotal revenues grew 3.1% year over year to $1.55 billion. However, the figure marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income went up 2.5% year over year to $952 million.
