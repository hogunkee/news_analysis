0,CHTR,"Merger-and-acquisition activity in the U.S. has been robust so far this year — the most in value since 2007 — thanks to a couple of huge deals in the works, including Charter Communications' $78.4 billion bid for Time Warner Cable and other transactions in media, technology and health care. From Jan. 1 to May 29, M&A activity reached $750.2 billion…
"
1,CHTR,"Charter Communications (CHTR) is close to a deal to buy larger Time Warner Cable (TWC) for $195 a share, according to multiple reports, after the Comcast (CMCSA)-TWC takeover failed due to regulatory opposition.Charter, the No. 3 U.S. cable operator, will pay $100 a share in cash and the rest in stock, for each share of No. 2 TWC, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing sources. The Financial Times and Reuters later filed similar reports.Both Bloomberg and FT said Charter would also buy Bright House, a smaller cable operator. Charter had a deal for Bright House earlier this year, but that agreement hinged on No. 1 Comcast buying Time Warner Cable.Time Warner Cable stock rose 3.4% to 171.18 on Friday, hitting a record 172.21 intraday. The stock rose 9.4% for the week amid growing speculation that Charter on French telecom Altice would make an offer.Charter closed Friday down 1.9% to 175.33, the lowest close in three months. Charter had sought to buy TWC last year, but was thwarted by Comcast.Charter's top shareholder is John Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBRDA).Separately, Cablevision (CVC) shares leapt 22.3% last week to their highest levels in nearly four years. But it's unclear if Cablevision is really a buyout target.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

2,CHTR,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: May Performance Report
"
3,CHTR,"Corporate takeovers were the theme for May, boosting mutual funds holding these stocks and testifying to resilience in the U.S. economy, even as mixed economic data trickled in.
"
4,CHTR,"The parade of pairings includedCharter (CHTR) and Time Warner (TWC), Avago (AVGO) and Broadcom (BRCM), Ascena (ASNA) and Ann (ANN), CVS (CVS) and Omnicare (OCR), Verizon (VZ) and AOL (AOL), and Danaher (DHR) and Pall (PLL).
"
5,CHTR,"""M&A activity continues to support the U.S. stock market,"" Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote May 26. The deals allow companies to expand into new markets, as well as gain efficiencies and earnings leverage.
"
6,CHTR,"And they came despite — or perhaps because of — sluggish manufacturing activity in May and an economy that shrank in the first quarter. In fact, weak data paradoxically boosted stocks because it ""alleviated concerns over an aggressive Federal Reserve rate-hiking regime,"" Koesterich added.

7,CHTR,"U.S. diversified equity funds rose 1.3% on average in May, according to Lipper Inc. General domestic taxable bond funds fell 0.42%.
"
8,CHTR,"Growth funds across the market-cap spectrum continued to notch the biggest gains. Small-cap growth funds beat last month, advancing 2.8% on average. That took their year-to-date gains to 6.2%. Midcap growth funds rallied 2% and 6.8% in the same periods.

"
12,CHTR,"Health care companies showed strong first-quarter earnings growth — 21.4% overall, topping all 10 S&P sectors.

Charter will send advisers to contact TWC about talks, Bloomberg said.Charter shares rose 1.2% on the stock market today. Comcast edged up 0.7%, and Time Warner Cable climbed 4.4%.Charter is unlikely to attempt a hostile takeover like it did in January 2014, sources told the Journal. Time Warner Cable rejected Charter's offer before accepting the one made by Comcast early last year.That megadeal was sunk after U.S. regulators — as well as consumer advocates — raised concerns about its potential effect on competition and consumers, including higher broadband prices.Time Warner Cable reportedly is concerned about the debt levels involved in a possible merger with Charter, since Charter would have to raise a lot of money.

Russia's defense ministry claimed its aircraft had not strayed into Turkish air space, was flying at 6,000 meters and was shot down from the ground.In either case, U.S. stock futures veered lower when the news broke. The stock market today felt additional premarket pressure after the U.S. State Department issued a global travel alert for Americans, based on planned terrorist threats across multiple regions, ahead of the travel-heavy Thanksgiving weekend. The alert, a less serious caution than a department travel warning, did not say citizens should not travel. But it advised travelers to remain vigilant and ""avoid large crowds or crowded places."" The alert expires on Feb. 24.Airline stocks and travel-related issues such as Priceline.com (PCLN) and TripAdvisor (TRIP) came under moderate premarket pressure following the release. Oil prices rose 1% to 2%, with West Texas Intermediate bobbing back above $42 a barrel and Europe's Brent crude benchmark above $45.The Commerce Department revised its estimate of third-quarter GDP growth upward to 2.1%.

108,CHTR,"JPMorgan says a Verizon Communications (VZ) merger with Comcast (CMCSA) is not going to happen, while a deal combining Verizon and No. 2 cable firm Charter Communications (CHTR) looks unlikely, too.But telecom firms Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) are more likely to be in play, says the investment bank.""We believe a combination of Verizon and Charter is feasible but difficult on the financials, but Comcast's overall size and NBC ownership make a deal with Verizon a nonstarter as the regulatory review process would likely be quite difficult,"" JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote Monday in a broad research report on telecom industry M&A scenarios.Comcast, Charter and other cable TV firms hold rights to lease access to Verizon's mobile network on a wholesale basis, under what's called an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement. Comcast plans to start wireless-services trials in mid-2017.Cusick says the cable TV firms and Verizon might try to forge a deeper partnership if an outright merger isn't doable, but he says that relationship likely would fray.IBD'S TAKE: Steel maker Nucor, Burlington Stores and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.""We don't believe that an MVNO structure will allow cable to be successful in wireless over time,"" he said. ""Cable's wireless business would eventually grow to a point where Verizon views them as a threat.""Shares of Verizon and Comcast fell a fraction in the stock market today, while Charter was flat. But Sprint stock rose 2.8% and T-Mobile 1%. Comcast and Charter are both extended from November breakouts.JPMorgan assigns the highest probability (35%) to Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) proposing a merger, while it estimates a 15% chance that Comcast could bid for T-Mobile or Sprint.Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam recently commented on the ""industrial logic"" of a Verizon-cable industry tie-up. And in his 2017 industry predictions, T-Mobile CEO John Legere said a Verizon-Comcast merger could happen.JPMorgan, though, says Comcast likely has other ideas, especially if a Sprint merger with T-Mobile does not materialize. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), which owns 65% of T-Mobile, could roll its equity into a larger company, says JPMorgan.A Comcast purchase of T-Mobile would be bad news for AT&T (T) and Verizon, says Cusick, because it would ""cement"" an industry structure with four national players, rather than three. ""If the Sprint deal does not work out, a cable transaction becomes the next most likely event for T-Mobile,"" said Cusick in his report.

109,CHTR,"Stock funds seemed only slightly less frenetic than President Trump setting policy in his first 100 days, as the average domestic stock fund rose 1.83% in January, padding gains of 1.46% in December and 10.81% in 2016.World equity funds did even better in January, advancing 3.86%, according to Lipper Inc.Taxable bond funds rose 0.76%, while municipal bond funds rose 0.46%.The S&P 500 rose 1.90% last month.Not all of the young year's gains are attributable to the new president and new Congress, say stock fund managers and strategists.""Regardless of who was elected, the economy was already improving,"" said Kimberly Scott, lead manager of $2.4 billion Ivy Mid Cap Growth (WMGAX) and co-manager of $288 million Ivy Mid Cap Income Opportunities (IVOAX) funds. ""The trajectory of corporate profits had already turned up. The outlook for corporate profits for the end of 2017 into 2018 was already quite strong. The policy changes concerning taxes, repatriation of overseas corporate cash (and) unwinding some onerous regulations that President Trump talked about could boost corporate profits more. But the economy was already getting stronger.""And mutual fund professionals expect the uptrend to continue this year.""The market could go in two very different ways,"" said Omar Aguilar, Charles Schwab Investment Management's chief investment officer of equities. ""On the one hand, there is a very powerful combination of factors that could translate into record levels for equities.""On the other hand, the market could go south. ""The attempt at reforms (of taxes, corporate cash repatriation and regulatory burdens) could increase the federal budget deficit,"" Aguilar said. ""There is a potential for trade wars. Emerging markets are still landing. A strong U.S. currency could hurt exports. Those headwinds could backfire into our economy and markets.""On balance, Aguilar is guardedly bullish. ""On a net basis we will see the market trend up,"" he said. ""But it will be volatile.""Scott is favoring stocks in sectors that typically benefit at the outset of a rally. ""Many think we're in the midcycle of a recovery,"" she said. ""But we had a significant corporate-profits recession. So to me this feels like an early-stage economic recovery, and that's when you want to shift more asset weight into technology, financials, energy and industry.""Consumer discretionary is usually part of that early-stage recovery party. But this time brick-and-mortar retailers are battling digital retailers. Brick-and-mortar retailers are being forced to spend on their own websites and low-cost delivery services, Scott says, which will continue to sap their earnings.Large-cap growth mutual funds' 4.10% gain on average in January led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.Yet investors were still jittery enough at times to drive precious-metals funds, a defensive category, up 14.94% last month, higher than any other sector. That beat basic-materials funds, which gained 7.31%.Latin American funds paced foreign stock fund categories by tacking on 7.67%.Taxable bonds were led by flexible-income funds 1.61% gain. Treasury funds inched up 0.36%.Trailing precious metals and several other sector fund categories, tech funds notched a 5.13% January gain. IPG Photonics (IPGP) is a technology name that John Barr, manager of $60 million Needham Aggressive Growth (NEAGX) — whose 9.32% average annual gain over the past 10 years topped 96% of its small-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. — likes in a market poised to continue higher but with volatility. The company makes fiber-optic lasers, which can be used for cutting and welding in industrial applications. As costs fall, laser systems become increasingly attractive, especially in welding, Barr says. ""Big automotive makers are quite interested in using this for welding,"" he said.Revenue grew 19% and 17% in the two most recent years. Earnings grew an average of 18% annually from 2014 to 2016. ""It has a long runway ahead, with great returns and great management,"" Barr said.PDF Solutions (PDFS) is another tech name Barr likes. The firm produces software that's the core of electrical testing of newly made semiconductors. It has the potential for taking share from more conventional optical testing systems, Barr says.Two major chipmakers signed on as customers in 2016. PDF's service is delivered on a subscription basis. ""So it has high margins and could double company earnings"" in the near term, Barr said, especially if it wins customers in China as the Middle Kingdom builds out its own semiconductor manufacturing industry between now and 2020.Ivy's Scott likes MercadoLibre (MELI), an Argentina-based online retailer that offers an electronic payment service. ""It's still in an earlier phase of development than Amazon (AMZN) is here,"" said Scott. ""There is no reason to think that demand for online buying and payment will not be as attractive to Latin Americans as it is in the U.S. and Asia.""Video-game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) is another of Scott's favorites. The video-game publisher benefits from a console-upgrade cycle and the shift to digital game downloads, which carry higher profit margins, as IBD has reported. Scott says now, ""I continue to like the tremendous changes in the products and innovation there. They make games that consumers love. And the way that these products are developed and distributed digitally is such a profit enhancer. We think that story continues.""Among financial services stocks, Scott likes regional banks such as First Republic (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY), which should benefit from rising rates and from a reduction in their regulatory burden. Trump targeted the Dodd-Frank Act for review on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Midsize regional banks have gotten a boost from congressional moves to raise the threshold of the Dodd-Frank Act's systemic risk designation. The existing rule applies to banks with at least $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to costly regulations. As IBD recently reported, Congress is looking at raising that to $250 billion.Scott also likes MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange that claims cheaper transaction costs than traditional investment-bank bond trades, easier odd-lot trading and specialization in corporate credit. ""There are others trying to do this, but none has gained the traction that MarketAxess has,"" she said.Amid the rally in energy stocks, Stephen DeNichilo, co-manager of $2.9 billion Federated Kaufmann Large Cap (KLCAX), likes small-cap Independence Contract Drilling (ICD). The company offers customers of energy exploration and production very sophisticated drilling rigs. ""They're on the leading edge of what E&P companies want,"" DeNichilo said. ""They have only 12 working rigs, so essentially they are fully utilized. They have leverage to the U.S. shale-pad drilling rally. They have a clean balance sheet. They are trading below their $10-a-share replacement value. And they could be a takeout candidate.""In addition to trading below 10, earnings per share growth has declined at triple-digit paces the past four quarters.Among industrials, DeNichilo likes Dycom Industries (DY). ""We like long-term investment themes,"" DeNichilo said. ""Dycom is the largest specialty contractor for fiber-(optic cable). They're the only national specialty contractor that puts fiber into the ground at a time when AT&T (T), CenturyLink (CTL), Charter (CHTR), Verizon (VZ) and other (telecoms) are about to ramp up.""That cycle will be sparked, DeNichilo says, by AT&T embarking on a massive plan to lay fiber so the telecom giant can offer customers high-speed internet service. ""Their plan is to bring 1-gigabit speed to (at least) 12 million customers by 2019,"" DeNichilo said. The industry has seen that when dramatically higher speeds are offered at the same or comparable cost, customers switch providers. ""Competitors will have to follow,"" he said. ""This will be a big cycle for Dycom. Also, fiber investments could be part of any large infrastructure (upgrade) plan by the government.""At the average U.S. broadband speed of about 18 megabits, downloading a two-hour movie takes more than 10 minutes. It takes eight seconds via 1-Gig fiber, according to fastmetrics.com. And AT&T's speed upgrade can be achieved solely through street-side fiber, and will not require any in-home rewiring or cable replacement, DeNichilo says.Dycom's earnings grew an average of 74% annually over the past three years. ""Despite earnings growth way above the market, they are trading below the market multiple,"" DeNichilo said.DeNichilo also likes Martin Marietta Materials (MLM). As the U.S. economy heats up, demand for construction aggregates will grow. ""Even without Trump's Mexican wall, nonresidential construction — which is the bulk of aggregate consumption — is still below its 55-year normal level,"" he said. ""This company has essentially doubled earnings per share over the past three years, so its outlook is fantastic whether there is a (federal government) infrastructure plan or not.""Ivy's Scott likes water-heater-maker A.O. Smith (AOS). ""There isn't a lot of cyclicality in their business,"" Scott said. ""Homeowners have to replace their heaters every 10 to 12 years. And they have a growing business in China for water heaters and water-purification systems. It's a nice growth engine for Smith.""Smith's average annual earnings growth rate was 24% from 2014 through 2016. ""They're a consistent grower and reliable payer of dividends,"" Scott added. The company's dividend yield is 1.1%. ""We're not a dividend fund, but it's nice to have on top of everything.""RELATED: Where Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewClick Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual Funds

Sales missed forecasts with customer traffic down 2%. The coffee shop giant, which also cut its revenue outlook, said its mobile order and pay was so popular that it created bottlenecks at order pick up, turning off some patrons. Starbucks shares fell 4% on Friday. Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) topped EPS and sales targets but U.S. comps fell as investors questioned if the momentum from the all-day breakfast menu has run out.

111,CHTR,"AT&T (T) now has 7.9 million subscribers who purchased both DirecTV satellite and unlimited wireless data service. It's a number that cable TV giant Comcast (CMCSA) could be eyeballing as it mulls whether to buy a wireless service provider such as T-Mobile US (TMUS) or Sprint (S), analysts say.AT&T acquired DirecTV Group for $49 billion in July, 2015. In early 2016, AT&T began selling unlimited wireless data plans but only to customers that also buy the DirecTV satellite service.T-Mobile US and Sprint both sell unlimited data packages but without pay-TV plans while Verizon Communications (VZ) does not.AT&T had 3 million bundled DirecTV/unlimited data wireless subscribers at the end of Q1, over 5 million in Q2, and 6.7 million in Q3. The number rose to 7.9 million in the December quarter.""The bundle helps lock in AT&T customers,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan told IBD.The 7.9 million bundled DirecTV subscribers represent roughly 14% of AT&T's smartphone customer base, says John Hodulik, a UBS analyst.IBD'S TAKE:  Netflix, steel maker Nucor, Quanta Services and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.AT&T also says it has signed up 200,000 subscribers for its Internet-based, DirecTV Now video streaming service.""Early trends, including the 7.9 million subscribers, suggest AT&T is effectively cross-selling products,"" said Hodulik, in a report. One question, though, is how many of the nearly 8 million subscribers are new to AT&T as opposed to existing ones that opted-in on the unlimited data/pay TV offer.Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Security, says AT&T's strategy works either way.

In July, Verizon announced its agreement to buy the Yahoo (YHOO) internet business for $4.8 billion, though reportedly they are talking about lowering the price after news surfaced of wide-scale date breaches at Yahoo.Moffett says aside from a big media deal like Disney, Verizon's other options include acquiring satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) or a cable TV firm. JPMorgan on Monday, in a research report, said a Verizon merger with Comcast (CMCSA) is far-fetched and a Charter Communications (CHTR) deal would be very difficult to pull off.Citigroup on Wednesday removed Dish Network from its ""focus list,"" but it maintained a buy rating and price target of 94. Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins says Verizon is less likely to buy Dish Network if Sprint and T-Mobile US propose a merger.Rollins says a combined Sprint-T-Mobile would likely divest radio spectrum to gain regulatory approval.

Comcast bought back $3.8 billion of its own stock in the first nine months of 2016. As of Sept. 30, 2016, Comcast had $6.2 billion available under its share repurchase authorization.""Investors should expect another double-digit dividend hike, with repurchases likely to remain steady at $5 billion (annually),"" said Mike McCormack, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report.Besides boosting EPS, buying back shares tends to lift a stock, which could help Comcast in acquisitions involving a mix of cash and stock, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Freeport-McMoRan, steel maker Nucor, Burlington Stores and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Comcast stock is trading well above its 50-day moving average, 8% extended from a buy point of 68.46 first touched in November,Q4 is a seasonally strong period for cable TV firms; Comcast added 89,000 video subscribers in the year-earlier (2015) period.Comcast appears on track to have positive video subscriber additions for the second year in a row, despite internet video competition, owing to its investments in the X1 set-top box platform.

But he said one hurdle to a Verizon acquisition of Dish Network would be co-founder Charles Ergen's ""super voting shares"" in the satellite TV broadcaster.Swinburne posited two Verizon acquisition scenarios for Dish at $85 per share, one all stock and one with a mix of stock and cash.""We note that in either scenario, Dish Chairman Charles Ergen would be an about 6% to 8% owner of the combined entity, and Verizon would have to negotiate how to deal with his super voting B shares (which give him 80% voting control of Dish today),"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Dish stock has moved above a 59.67 buy point coming out of a flat base and is trading above its 50-day moving average.

""Mid-band spectrum like DISH's offers greater data capacity than low-band, particularly in urban and suburban markets where network demands are highest,"" Swinburne said.Analysts expect telecom industry merger talks to pick up after a government auction of airwaves controlled by local TV broadcasters concludes, perhaps in mid-March. Bidders were barred from taking part in strategic talks since the start of the auction last March.JPMorgan, in its report, also spoke of the end of the auction as a catalyst.""While we expect strategic conversations to at least ramp up once the Incentive Auction is over, we don't see a Dish deal as anyone's first choice,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote.

117,CHTR,"Wells Fargo downgraded Verizon Communications (VZ) on 2017 ""revenue growth headwinds,"" and Verizon takeover target Yahoo (YHOO) faces an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission relating to two massive data breaches the company revealed last year.Verizon, which in July announced its agreement to buy Yahoo for $4.8 billion, reports Q4 earnings before the open Tuesday. Analysts estimate Verizon's Q4 revenue fell 6.3% year over year to $32.1 billion, with profit rising by a penny to 90 cents a share.Yahoo, meanwhile, is set to report its Q4 earnings after the close Monday. Analysts estimate Yahoo's revenue rose 8.5% to $1.38 billion, and they expect earnings per share minus items rising to 21 cents from 13 cents in the year-earlier period.Shares of both Verizon fell 0.57% to 52.42 in the stock market today, but Yahoo stock rose 0.83% to 42.40.IBD'S TAKE: Steel maker Nucor, Burlington Stores and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping. Jennifer Fritzsche, a Well Fargo analyst, on Monday downgraded Verizon to market perform from buy.""This is not a call on its Q4 earnings. Rather, we do not think Verizon's outperformance since the presidential election (+10.1% vs. S&P of +5.0%) is sustainable given growth headwinds in 2017,"" said Fritzsche in her research report. ""While we still favor Verizon's network superiority and free cash flow generation, we struggle with near-term catalysts.""The SEC reportedly is probing whether Yahoo properly disclosed details about the cyberattacks to shareholders and whether it complied with civil securities laws.Yahoo on Jan. 9 said that, after selling its core Yahoo web portal business to Verizon, it would change its name to Altaba. This will be a holding company for its stakes in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Holdings (BABA) and in Yahoo Japan, which is not being sold to Verizon.Verizon seems prepared to go through with its planned acquisition of Yahoo's internet operations, analysts say, though it may be seeking a reduction on the $4.8 billion price tag as a result of the data breaches. In December, Yahoo disclosed a data breach dating to 2013 that could have involved 1 billion user accounts, this after the company three months earlier had disclosed a circa 2014 breach that might have involved 500 million accounts. The SEC reportedly is investigating why it took Yahoo so long to disclose the breaches.Besides Yahoo, topics on Verizon's earnings call could include regulation under the Trump administration, partnerships (or more) with cable TV firms such as Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR); and wireless service revenue and margin trends.  T-Mobile US (TMUS) is again expected to lead wireless firms in Q4 subscriber and revenue growth.RELATED:T-Mobile Hits All-Time High; Comcast, Verizon UpgradedCash Key In SoftBank-Sprint 'Knockout' Offer For T-Mobile?Verizon M&A Talk Swirls; Charter Stock Up, Yahoo Down

Comcast stock also is trading near an all-time high. Learn more about T-Mobile and Comcast at IBD Stock Checkup.Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman, in a research report Tuesday, called T-Mobile the likely ""big winner"" in the government's auction of radio spectrum of airwaves controlled by TV broadcasters. T-Mobile likely gained the spectrum it needed at a lower price than estimated, he said.HSBC, meanwhile, upgraded Comcast (CMCSA)and Verizon Communications (VZ)to buy and initiated coverage on Charter Communications (CHTR) with a hold rating.Comcast has also been viewed as a possible suitor for T-Mobile, which is controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY).Comcast stock, which on Friday hit a record high just under 73, edged up a fraction Thursday to 72.61. It's extended from its November breakout at a buy point of 68.46.The Federal Communications Commission's auction of airwaves brought in about $18.2 billion in bids, more than the latest $10 billion asking price of TV broadcasters. Broadcasters stand to get their $10 billion, while other proceeds will cover costs tied to ""repacking"" the spectrum for wireless services or go to the U.S. treasury.T-Mobile had estimated it could spend $8 to $10 billion in the auction alone. Analysts expect that Verizon and AT&T (T) bid less than forecast. One hitch for T-Mobile is that the TV spectrum might not be ready for wireless services until 2020.Bidders were barred from taking part in strategic talks until the auction closes, which BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk says could be in late February. Telecom firms may be free to resume M&A talks by mid-March, he says. Goldman Sachs says the FCC's quiet period might not be over until the end of March.""With the close of the auction, attention should quickly turn to M&A, which has largely been prohibited during the auction, for registered participants,"" Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack said in a research report.

120,CHTR,"Sprint (S)-owner SoftBank Group could muster a knockout offer for T-Mobile US (TMUS) that would thwart any counter bid by cable TV firms such as Comcast (CMCSA), says New Street Research.Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at U.K.-based New Street Research, says debt-laden SoftBank would need to pump a lot of cash into any Sprint offer for T-Mobile to get a controlling stake in a merged company.T-Mobile, which is majority owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), has a market valuation of $48 billion after a steep runup in 2016. T-Mobile shareholders would expect a premium, with bids by satellite TV firm Dish Network, cable companies or perhaps even a cable-consortium possible, New Street said in a research report published Sunday.In a ""knockout"" scenario, Sprint could offer about $47 billion in cash and $22 billion in equity, for a combined $69 billion, not including deal synergies, says Chaplin.""In this scenario, we assume an offer price of $80 per share,"" said Chaplin in a report. ""We would consider this a knockout bid; it would be tough for a cable company, Dish Network (DISH) or some other interloper to table a more compelling offer.""IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock jumped in late 2016 on speculation that it could merge with Sprint during a Trump administration. But short interest in T-Mobile doubled in December.

The deals are aimed at creating multiproduct bundles and network synergies.Media baron John Malone last week said Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and other cable TV firms could bid successfully for T-Mobile.SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Deutsche Telekom owns two-thirds of T-Mobile.T-Mobile has openly courted cable TV partners on its earnings calls. But amid intensified wireless competition, the most profit-margin-friendly deal remains a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, many analysts say.Such a deal, though, would reduce the number of national wireless firms from four to three. The Obama administration blocked AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying it wanted to retain a four-player national market of AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Communications (VZ).Chaplin speculates that a combined Sprint and T-Mobile would sell off some 50 MHz of spectrum to garner regulatory approval as well as raise cash.Sprint stock edged up 4 cents in the stock market today to 8.65.

121,CHTR,"TV broadcasters reduced their asking price for prime wireless airwaves for the fourth time — to just over $10 billion from what was once $86 billion, though now for a reduced amount of spectrum — setting the stage for a possible auction failure if wireless phone companies and other bidders do not bite at the fire-sale price.The Federal Communications Commission has imposed a quiet period on bidders, banning any strategic talks during the action, which began in March.If the auction ends suddenly, it would open the doors to renewed merger talks among phone companies and cable TV firms. In that case, industry speculation would focus on T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Comcast (CMCSA), Dish Network (DISH) and Verizon Communications (VZ), as well as others.In the meantime, AT&T (T) is seeking approval to buy Time Warner (TWX) for $85 billion, a deal that itself could spark other M&A talks.In earlier auction rounds, TV broadcasters lowered their asking price from $86 billion to $54.6 billion, then to $40.3 billion, and then again to $19.7 billion.The $10 billion-plus reduced price would be for up to 84 MHz of radio spectrum, down from the original plans to auction off 120 MHz of airwaves.TV broadcasters can walk away if bids do not meet the now drastically reduced price tag. While there is an overall goal, the bidding process involves blocks of airwaves in local markets such as New York and Chicago, as well as much smaller markets.IBD'S TAKE: The auction outcome is especially important to T-Mobile, which analysts say needs more airwaves. But T-Mobile could fill its needs through a merger or partnerships as well. T-Mobile stock jumped in late 2016 on speculation that it could merge with Sprint during a Trump administration.

Analysts say it's possible that the two biggest wireless firms, AT&T and Verizon, are no longer aggressively bidding.AT&T appears likely to win the federal contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety, analysts say. As part of the FirstNet contract, AT&T would gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum.The auction's outcome is important to Dish Network, which has amassed nearly 80 MHz of spectrum but has spent years looking for a wireless partner.While Verizon looms as a partner for Dish, another scenario is that Verizon could deepen its relationship with cable TV firms Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) under a wholesale network leasing agreement.Broadcasting and Cable reported that the FCC's soon-to-be Republican majority has been asked by one TV station owner to hit the pause button on the broadcast incentive auction and re-evaluate its ""anemic participation"" by wireless providers.RELATED:AT&T Seen Winning FirstNet, May Roil TV Airwaves AuctionHow Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosSpectrum Wild Cards May Add Supply, Impact Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T

122,CHTR,"San Francisco-based AppDynamics, which makes software companies use to analyze the performance of their apps, on Wednesday filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to make an initial public offering, looking to raise up to $100 million.The company filed under the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act. It did not set an expected price range, but it listed as underwriters some of Wall Street's biggest firms, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.AppDynamics reported revenue of $158.4 million for the nine months ended Oct. 31, up 54% from the year-earlier period. It reported losses of $95.1 million for the recent nine-month period, vs. $92.4 million in losses for the year-earlier period.IBD'S TAKE: Arista Networks had been among the best-performing IPOs this year.

Some expect that could open the door to other so-called ""unicorns,"" the nickname for tech startups valued at more than $1 billion.

123,CHTR,"Examples abound about how internet, media and telecom companies are accelerating their push into mobile video:Why the rush?As more consumers watch video on mobile phones, the U.S. advertising market hit a milestone in 2016: Digital ad spending surpassed TV ad spending for the first time, projected market tracker eMarketer.Desktop PC display and search ads are still the biggest categories of digital spending. But mobile ad spending has emerged as the main driver of digital revenue, jumping 45% to $46 billion in 2016, forecasts eMarketer.By 2019, mobile ad spending is expected to represent one-third of total media ad spending in the U.S., mainly driven by video ads.Oft-called the third screen after broadcast TV and PCs, mobile ranking must be adjusted, says Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics.""Mobile is eating the internet,"" said Entner, coining a phrase similar to venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's ""Why Software Is Eating the World"" essay five years ago.""Seventy percent of mobile traffic is video,"" Entner added. ""The mobile device is turning into the first screen to entertain and inform yourself. It was the third screen, now it's becoming the first screen, overtaking television and the desktop.""John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile US (TMUS), has a mantra of his own: ""All content is going to the internet, and the internet is going mobile.""T-Mobile in 2016 shook up the wireless market with free video streaming for many popular apps.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix's success adding subscribers outside the U.S. is just one reason it makes the IBD Leaderboard, a listing of top stocks poised to possibly bring the biggest gains. See what other companies make the current list.So how does a stock investor play the mobile video trend? Let's imagine a word association game. What companies come to mind first for ""mobile video""?Probably not Apple (AAPL) — yet. Probably not Netflix (NFLX), for that matter.Apple's huge base of iPhone users represent a lot of mobile screens, but Apple apparently has shelved plans for its own web TV service, unable to forge a deal with broadcasters. Apple, though, reportedly has lowered the amount it charges to sell video services through its widely used App Store, which should increase the movies and TV shows offered to iPhone users from other parties. Apple reportedly cut its fee to 15% from 30% of monthly subscription billings.Netflix, the top provider of subscription video-on-demand services, doesn't sell advertising. Netflix has invested in long-form, original content rather than shorter video clips. Netflix in early 2016 accounted for only 3.7% of mobile data traffic but 35% of fixed-line broadband traffic, said a report from networking gear maker Sandvine. Its study doesn't measure Wi-Fi network usage, where Netflix traffic might be high.AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) make a match for mobile video investing plays. Verizon acquired AOL for $4.4 billion in 2016 and has agreed to buy Yahoo (YHOO). Verizon aims to build a digital ad platform rivaling those of Google and Facebook.And in late 2015, Verizon launched its G090 mobile video service, which targets millennials. The free, ad-supported Go90 service offers a mix of original web TV series, live sports, concert streaming and more. While Go90 has been off to a rocky start (Verizon has not disclosed any operating metrics), the telecom firm has brought in new executives to reboot content and build a bigger audience for ads.AT&T , meanwhile, in late November launched its DirecTV Now video streaming service, which starts at $35 per month. The linchpin to AT&T's mobile video strategy is allowing its wireless subscribers to stream DirecTV Now without eating into their monthly data caps.Entner says AT&T will pressure other new entrants in live TV streaming — such as Hulu, Amazon and Google's YouTube — to develop ""mobile-first"" strategies. Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS), and Comcast.AT&T in late October agreed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion. Its assets include HBO, sports-oriented Turner Broadcasting, and a stake in Hulu.The Time Warner deal is designed to ""get the most content to the most people at the lowest prices, delivered on any screen, particularly mobile,"" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told analysts.If AT&T's DirecTV Now succeeds, it could pressure Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) to acquire a wireless firm, perhaps T-Mobile, some analysts speculate.The conundrum for AT&T and traditional media companies pushing into mobile video is that the younger age groups advertisers covet tend to watch shorter pieces, not long-form content. User-generated and social-media-shared content is still the biggest part of mobile video consumption. And live streaming via Facebook, YouTube and Twitter's (TWTR) Periscope compete for millennial attention against streaming pay-TV services such as CBS (CBS) All Access, which recently disclosed it has 1.2 million subscribers.On Facebook's Q3 earnings call Nov. 2, CEO Mark Zuckerberg trumpeted plans to become a ""video-first"" company. Zuckerberg says that within five years most of what people consume online will be video. Analysts speculate Facebook could develop a stand-alone app that competes directly with YouTube.Then, there's the Facebook-Instagram rival Snapchat, which has some 400 million users. Snapchat claims that it has some 10 billion daily video views. It limits videos to 10 seconds in length. Snapchat also offers its ""Discover"" portal of short-clip web videos. Owner Snap has filed for a confidential IPO and is expected to debut on the stock market early in 2017.While Google and Facebook dominate digital advertising, one question is whether another top digital publisher will emerge, such as Snapchat or Verizon, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri wrote in a recent research report.As for the question near the top of this story: Asked what comes to his mind first when he hears the term ""mobile video,"" Entner quickly replied ""YouTube.""""Mobile video is still dominated by YouTube,"" he said. ""There is tremendous innovation. People you've never heard of start their own video channel and suddenly have more followers than people who watch episodes of 'The Big Bang Theory.'""RELATED:Alphabet, Facebook Dominate Mobile App Downloads

AT&T has been the biggest loser of postpaid phone subscribers.Analysts had estimated that T-Mobile would add 902,000 postpaid phone subscribers in Q4. Postpaid subscribers — those billed monthly — are more lucrative for carriers than prepaid users, who buy minutes as needed.T-Mobile added 1.29 million postpaid subscribers overall in Q4 2015, including tablet users, and 917,000 postpaid phone subscribers. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) controls T-Mobile US.T-Mobile stock fell 2.1% to 57.61 in the stock market today, a day after touching a record high of 59.46. T-Mobile stock jumped 47% in 2016, with most of the gain coming in Q4.Observers speculate Sprint and T-Mobile could renew merger talks during a Trump administration. Comcast (CMCSA) could also bid for T-Mobile, perhaps teaming with Charter Communications (CHTR), analysts say.T-Mobile, though, continues to outperform rivals on its own.T-Mobile in October reported higher-than-expected Q3 profit and raised full-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).Jennifer Fritzche, a Wells Fargo analyst, estimates that AT&T lost 220,000 postpaid phone subscribers in Q4, despite unveiling its new DirecTV Now mobile video service in late November. Fritzche estimates Verizon added 57,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the December quarter.While AT&T and Verizon now offer monthly installment payment plans for mobile phones, they have not matched every T-Mobile promotion. T-Mobile has added 4.1 million postpaid subscribers in 2016.Bellevue, Wash.-based T-Mobile in October raised its 2016 postpaid phone subscriber forecast to 3.8 million at the midpoint of its guidance, up from its earlier estimates of 3.4 million and 2.9 million.

132,CHTR,"The spotlight shifts to AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and other registered bidders next week in a government spectrum auction, after TV broadcasters again reduced their asking price for prime wireless airwaves, this time to $40.3 billion.In two earlier rounds, TV broadcasters initially sought $86 billion for 100 megahertz of usable radio spectrum, then dropped their asking price to $54.6 billion for 90 MHz. If bidders agree to pay at least $40.3 billion combined, that would open up 80 MHz of airwaves for mobile video and other data services.While there is an overall goal, the bidding process involves blocks of airwaves in local markets, such as New York and Chicago, as well as much smaller ones. The Federal Communications Commission has set price ranges for specific markets.The next stage of the auction might start as soon as Monday. The big question is whether AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Comcast (CMCSA) and other registered bidders will bite at the reduced, $40.3 billion price tag. Broadcasters, meanwhile, could walk away from the auction at any point if disappointed.IBD'S TAKE: A successful auction is important to T-Mobile, which analysts say is most in need of more airwaves. T-Mobile stock is up nearly 40% in 2016. Dish Network stock has been in a trading range since the auction started in March. Learn more about Comcast, another registered bidder, at IBD Stock CheckupIt's not clear if the auction will be affected if FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler resigns in January, when Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office.The shift to a Republican-led FCC ""could leave the spectrum auction inconclusive,"" said Amy Yong, a Macquarie Capital analyst, in a research report.UBS analyst John Hodulik says the auction will likely move into a fourth round in late December, extending into 2017. He says ultimately only 60 MHz or 70 MHz in total could be auctioned, at a lower price point around $30 billion.The FCC has imposed a quiet period on bidders, banning strategic talks among them until the auction is over.""A quicker end to the auction would be positive for T-Mobile and Dish Network (DISH),"" said Hodulik in a report. ""Once the auction ends, the anti-collusion rules no longer apply, likely paving the way for discussions around strategic initiatives and M&A.""Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins also forecasts a spectrum price tag of around $30 billion.""Verizon likely did not place a meaningful deposit and is not a meaningful bidder at this auction,"" said Rollins in a report Friday. ""We believe Verizon's actions and continued stated preference for mid-band spectrum supports our view that Verizon is likely to pursue an acquisition of Dish's spectrum or all of Dish at some point in the future.""Another scenario, analysts say, is that Verizon could deepen its relationship with cable TV firms Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) under a wholesale network leasing agreement.Shares of Dish fell 1.2% to 55.55 while AT&T was off 0.7% to 38.61 on the stock market today. Verizon inched down 6 cents to 49.81 and T-Mobile was up a fraction to 54.44.RELATED:How Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosSpectrum Wild Cards May Add Supply, Impact Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T

133,CHTR,"At the urging of Republican lawmakers, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler late Wednesday removed the ""controversial items"" from the FCC's Thursday meeting agenda. Republicans wanted to give President-elect Donald Trump time to set up his new administration before the agency vote on such items as a proposal to regulate prices in the $20 billion market for business data services.The move by Republican lawmakers was similar to requests by Democrats in Congress when Barack Obama won the 2008 presidential election.The five-member Federal Communications Commission consists of three Democrats, including Wheeler, and two Republicans.Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai is the front-runner to replace Wheeler, Macquarie Securities analyst Amy Yong said in a research note.""During the last presidential transition, the commission chairman wisely heeded the will of Congress in setting aside any remaining controversial agenda items for the next Congress and administration to consider,"" said Republican FCC Commissioner Mike O'Rielly in a statement on Tuesday. ""I thank the current leadership of both Senate and House commerce committees for calling this precedent to everyone's attention today, and expect that Chairman Wheeler will honor their request.""IBD'S TAKE: Comcast stock has gained 7.5% since Donald Trump's surprise election as president on Nov. 8, and Charter stock is up, too. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.The FCC in October adopted new ""opt-in"" consumer data-privacy rules governing broadband services, giving Wheeler a win after he shelved a controversial proposal on cable-TV set-top boxes last month.Analysts expect Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress to ease up on regulation after Wheeler battled the telecom industry on broadband, internet and other issues.Business data services had been on the agenda for Thursday's FCC meeting. The FCC rules would regulate new entrants in the market — cable-TV firms such as Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) as well as the biggest providers of business data services, including AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), and local phone companies CenturyLink (CTL) and Frontier Communications (FTR).

Smaller telecom firms such as Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Cogent Communications (CCOI) sometimes rent the ""special access"" lines to serve their customers. Some renters have complained over long-term contracts and termination fees.Comcast stock rose 0.7% to close at 67.47 on the stock market today.

134,CHTR,"As AT&T (T) forges ahead with its mobile video strategy, the incoming Trump administration aims to dismantle net neutrality rules that govern internet services, say political pundits.For AT&T, the timing couldn't be better. AT&T on Wednesday launched its DirecTV Now online video streaming service. The linchpin to AT&T's mobile video strategy is allowing its wireless subscribers to stream DirecTV Now without eating into their monthly data caps.While President Obama's Federal Communications Commission has voiced concern that AT&T's DirecTV Now plans might well conflict with net neutrality, a Republican-led FCC is not likely to stand in AT&T's way.Whether broadband service providers like AT&T can favor their own services has been one of the hot potatoes in the net neutrality debate. Net neutrality rules bar internet service providers from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. Under the Obama administration, the FCC sought new regulatory authority to enforce the rules and extended them to wireless networks for the first time.IBD'S TAKE: Comcast's stock has gained 21% in 2016, with much of it coming since Trump's surprise election as President. AT&T stock, which had outperformed in the first half of 2016 amid the popularity of dividend-paying stocks, now lags. Learn more about companies that may gain from lighter regulation at IBD Stock Checkup.A Trump FCC, on the other hand, will likely favor ISPs at the expense of companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Netflix (NFLX), analysts say. ISPs such as Comcast (CMCSA), AT&T, Verizon Communications (VZ) and Charter Communications (CHTR) could get a boost from new revenue streams.If net neutrality rules are weakened or eliminated, ISPs might be able to charge online video services for network bandwidth usage, raising questions for web streaming services from the likes of CBS (CBS), Alphabet's YouTube and soon Hulu, or potentially Walt Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL), among others that might join the competition. ISPs might seek fees for ""fast lane"" services from content providers.""We expect the idea of paying for fast lanes to be front and center in the debate,"" Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack told IBD. ""Content providers are likely to oppose any change, though larger, well-capitalized companies could hold an advantage relative to (smaller startups) unwilling or unable to pay for fast lanes.""Some observers say the stakes are big.""As video becomes an increasingly important growth driver for large-scale internet platforms (Amazon.com's (AMZN) Prime, Google's YouTube, Facebook (FB) Live), the risks posed by rollback of net neutrality are magnified,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a research report.While many pundits have touted a doomsday scenario for net neutrality, Trump hardly mentioned telecom policy during the campaign, so it's still uncertain if he'll seek to totally gut net neutrality. He did, however, voice opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), saying it would result in too much concentration of media power in one company's hands.AT&T stock fell 3% on Friday, Oct. 21, on reports of the deal for Time Warner, which the companies announced the next day, sending AT&T shares down another 1.7% the following Monday. Since then, AT&T stock has risen 5.5%, closing Friday down a fraction, to 38.61.Also, Trump has named two net neutrality opponents to his telecom transition team. One of them, pro-business economist Jeffrey Eisenach, could be named the next FCC chairman.The agency's current senior Republican member, Ajit Pai, also is in the running, analysts say. If current FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler steps down in January, Pai could be named chairman at least on an interim basis, until the U.S. Senate holds hearings on administration appointees.Obama named his telecom transition leader, Julius Genachowski, as the new FCC chairman in March 2009. The Senate, though Democratic-controlled, didn't confirm Genachowski as chair until late June that year.Pai is a net neutrality critic and a longtime Washington insider.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan is cautious about sweeping changes under a new FCC in any event. He expects Republican lawmakers in Congress to play a bigger role.""We believe this group (lawmakers) is significantly more dovish on the net neutrality concept than their FCC peers,"" said Horan in a research report. ""We conclude the FCC will likely withdraw their authority to enforce net neutrality. However, we also believe that legislation will be passed that reintroduces the core tenants of net neutrality.""Republicans hold a narrow majority in the Senate, so Democrats could aim to stall any net neutrality bill with a filibuster.Andy Lipman senior partner at Washington, D.C., law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, says Republicans could forge a compromise with enough Senate Democrats to pass a bill that takes away the ""Title II"" public utility-type net neutrality rules sought by Obama's FCC while preserving core open internet tenets, such as no blocking or throttling of content.A new telecom bill might leave it up to the FCC to address issues such as fast-lane prioritization of content or ""zero-rating,"" a regulatory term for what AT&T is doing with wireless data caps, says Lipman.In the end, that would be good for ISPs.""Enforcement is at bottom discretionary,"" Lipman told IBD. ""A Republican FCC would be less willing to micromanage sponsored data and zero-rating.""Netflix stock has been among those pressured by hand-wringing over net neutrality.Netflix accounts for more than 30% of peak downstream internet traffic, making it a prime target of broadband providers for bandwidth fees, says a Baird report.During the Obama administration, Netflix pushed for stricter regulation of interconnection agreements between ISPs and programmers that operate their own content delivery networks.Interconnection deals involve internet ports, network locations where data traffic is exchanged. Netflix works with middlemen such as Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Cogent Communications (CCOI), whose networks carry traffic between cities.""Netflix already has paying arrangements in place with the major ISPs in the U.S.,"" said Ralph Schackart, an analyst at William Blair. ""Any potential reversal of net neutrality rules by the FCC would not supersede agreements that are already established. We believe the net neutrality fears are overblown.""RELATED:AT&T, Comcast, Verizon Eye Next FCC Chair, Eisenach Front-Runner?How Verizon, Comcast, Dish, T-Mobile Figure In Telecom M&A ScenariosFCC's Wheeler, At Urging Of Republicans, Pulls Controversial ItemsComcast: Does Trump Win Portend Regulatory Rollback?

135,CHTR,"Aiming to make video streaming a big driver of its mobile business, AT&T (T) laid out the nitty-gritty details of its DirecTV Now service, which will start at $35 a month for 100 channels but will go up to $60 after a promotional period ends.AT&T, after the introductory period, also will offer 60 channels for $35 monthly and 80 channels for $50 monthly. While AT&T's promotional price is aggressive, the longer-term pricing for various packages is in line with or above analyst expectations.But users that sign up for the $35 promotion has that rate for as long as they subscribe to the service.If DirecTV Now customers sign up for three months, they qualify for an Apple (AAPL) TV streaming device that normally retails for $150.

""But by definition, that means that demand for the product will be lower as well.""I'm sure they'll get some existing customers to trade down, but it will take some time to find out whether cord cutters are willing to pay that much for an OTT service.""AT&T says it's targeting 20 million homes that do not have a pay-TV subscription currently, but the wireless video offering could attract customers of cable TV firms like Comcast (CMCSA), analysts say. With DirecTV satellite and its U-Verse service, AT&T has 25 million pay-TV customers of its own that it does not want to see switch to the lower-cost streaming package, says Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, in a research report.""AT&T can't undermine the economics of traditional pay-TV; they would have the most to lose if they did,"" Chaplin said.The DirecTV Now streaming service, though, could boost AT&T's wireless business, where growth has stalled amid continuing postpaid subscriber losses.AT&T aims to get a jump on Hulu Live, a new offering expected from the joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Comcast's NBC Universal. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) might also launch new streaming services with live content in 2017, analysts say.AT&T will not charge its own wireless subscribers for consuming data tied to the DirecTV Now service, a practice similar to what Verizon Communications (VZ) does with its millennial-focused Go90 service. T-Mobile US (TMUS), meanwhile, provides free streaming of Dish Network's (DISH) Sling service to its subscribers.AT&T's DirecTV Now does not provide a cloud-based DVR service and limits users to two simultaneous video streams. Dish's Sling on Monday said its customers will soon be able to record TV shows and store them online for later viewing.AT&T acquired satellite broadcaster DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015, gaining negotiating leverage with content providers. While Fox, Disney and NBCU have joined AT&T's programming lineup, CBS (CBS) is not part of the lineup. CBS has its own stand-alone streaming service.AT&T has stated DirecTV Now will have lower profit margins than its traditional, U-verse pay-TV services.

Time Warner and its HBO, as well as content from Viacom (VIA), A&E, Discovery and Starz, are part of DirecTV Now's channel package. HBO will cost $5 extra per month, down from its usual $10 to $15 fee.RELATED:AT&T Swallows Razor-Thin Margins On $35 Video Streaming DealHulu Live Service Gets Fox And Disney, Waiting On CBS, NBCUJohn Malone Talks Up Apple Buy Of Disney, Likes AT&T Strategy

140,CHTR,"AT&T (T) grabbed the headlines last month with its proposed $85 billion acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), but the future of the telecom industry also is riding on what happens next among Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA), satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) and fast-growing wireless firm T-Mobile US (TMUS).How federal regulators would view proposed mergers among these companies figures heavily into the industry's future, analysts say, and talks figure to heat up early next year with the ending of a government spectrum auction that prohibits strategic talks among any bidders.Among the big questions is whether the status quo will be shaken up — cable TV firms dominate in providing high-speed internet services to homes while phone companies AT&T and Verizon generate the lion's share of wireless industry profits.IBD'S TAKE: AT&T stock has shed 16% since Oct. 1 amid speculation over rising interest rates and reaction to the Time Warner takeover bid. Look for news about other dividend paying stocks at The Income Investor.In one scenario, Verizon could deepen its partnership with Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and other cable TV firms. In that case, Verizon and the cable TV firms would update a wireless network access and marketing deal born in 2011, says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.If that happens, Verizon could drop its much touted plans to unleash superfast 5G wireless services vs. cable firms in the residential broadband market. Verizon is testing 5G services and could roll out wireless broadband within two years, and it's considered to be ahead of rivals in 5G.""Verizon's entry into fixed wireless broadband is a clear threat to cable — and cable's entry into wireless is a clear threat to Verizon,"" Moffett told IBD. ""Each has a fair amount of leverage with the other.""If Verizon and the cable industry form an alliance, a Comcast acquisition of T-Mobile or Sprint (S) and a Verizon purchase of Dish Network — deals that have been subject of hot and cold rumors in recent years — would likely be off the table, analysts say.Another wild card in the industry's future is a government auction of radio spectrum owned by TV broadcasters. Begun in March, it's expected to end in early 2017. Companies that filed as bidders will once again be allowed to engage in strategic talks, as anti-collusion rules go away.If Comcast acquires substantial spectrum in the auction, that could be a precursor to buying a wireless firm such as T-Mobile around 2018, one theory goes. On the other hand, Comcast also might gain more spectrum to trade in a network-sharing deal with Verizon, so it wouldn't need T-Mobile.Dish Network has a big stake in the auction's outcome, analysts say. Depending on the results, Verizon could have more reason to acquire Dish Network and its nearly 80 MHz of wireless airwaves, says Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins.""As the 600MHz auction winds down, Dish may be a logical acquisition for Verizon,"" Rollins wrote in a research report. ""Dish helps Verizon close its spectrum gap vs. rivals.""Second, if Verizon deploys nationwide fixed wireless for in-home broadband (vs. cable), it will need a nationwide team of techs and trucks for installs. Dish has this. Third, Dish could help Verizon bundle video/mobile nationally at scale.""AT&T acquired satellite broadcaster DirecTV in 2015 to boost its mobile video strategy, he noted. If Verizon buys Dish Network, it could structure a stock and cash deal to ease concerns over its credit rating and tax worries for Dish founder Charles Ergen, Rollins says.Where do T-Mobile and Sprint fit into merger scenarios? T-Mobile has openly courted cable TV partners on its earnings calls. But amid intensified wireless competition, the most profit-margin-friendly deal remains a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, many analysts say.Such a deal, though, would reduce the number of national wireless firms from four to three. The Obama administration blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying it wanted to retain a four-player national market.It's unlikely a new Democratic administration would be more friendly to a Sprint merger with T-Mobile, analysts say. Both companies are foreign-controlled. Japan's SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) owns a two-thirds stake in T-Mobile.T-Mobile and Sprint, however, could have a better argument to present to regulators if their rivals continue to get bigger.AT&T and CenturyLink (CTL) didn't wait to find out how a Clinton-led or Trump-led Department of Justice would view telecom and media mergers.AT&T's agreement to acquire Time Warner, announced Oct. 22, bears similarities to Comcast's 2011 purchase of NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE), analysts say. Conditions that federal regulators set on the Comcast-NBCU deal might serve as a blueprint for the AT&T-Time Warner deal, though the Internet video market has evolved over the past five years, says Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack.Time Warner's assets include HBO and Turner Broadcasting, which has rights to sports telecasts. It also owns Warner Bros. film studio and cable networks TNT, TBS and CNN, as well as a 10% stake in internet video provider Hulu.CenturyLink (CTL), meanwhile, on Oct. 31 announced an agreement to buy Level 3 Communications (LVLT) for about $34 billion cash and stock. The combined company will be a stronger rival to AT&T and Verizon in the market for business services.Broomfield, Colo.-based Level 3 operates one of the world's largest internet backbones. CenturyLink morphed into the nation's No. 3 local phone company, behind Verizon and AT&T, by purchasing Qwest and Embarq. Neither CenturyLink or Level 3 owns a wireless network.AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner plays into its mobile video strategy, says UBS analyst John Hodulik.""It's a watershed event for the communications ecosystem,"" said Hodulik.Regulators are certain to look at whether AT&T aims to provide some of Time Warner's content exclusively to its customers. Netflix (NFLX) has stated it's fine with the deal as long as AT&T provides equally speedy internet access for its streaming video as its does for rival HBO.The AT&T and CenturyLink acquisitions announcements came amid slowing growth for each of them.AT&T's third-quarter revenue missed analysts' expectations, as it posted a net loss of 268,000 postpaid phone accounts amid intensified wireless competition.Buying Time Warner will boost AT&T's free cash flow to support its dividend payments, as did its 2015 purchase of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group, says Hodulik. Level 3's cash flow, meanwhile, will support CenturyLink's dividends.The current low interest rates will help both AT&T and CenturyLink finance their acquisitions.""Cheap debt makes the numbers work,"" Hodulik said. ""For CenturyLink, keeping the dividend safe was the main concern along with establishing a path to growth.""RELATED:How Aggressive AT&T Has Out-Maneuvered Verizon, Comcast

142,CHTR,"AT&T (T) will sell a 100 channel-plus video-streaming service branded ""DirecTV Now"" starting at $35 monthly, its CEO Randall Stephenson said at a conference on Tuesday. Programming may not include much content from CBS (CBS) or 21st Century Fox (FOXA), based on earlier reports.AT&T's $35 price-tag is about $15 below estimates by Wall Street analysts.AT&T's pricing could impact the strategies of Hulu, which is expected to launch a live-streaming TV service in early 2017, as well as Amazon.com (AMZN). Hulu is a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), Fox and Comcast (CMCSA).AT&T has stated DirecTV Now will have lower profit margins than its traditional, U-verse pay-TV services. Like other providers of so-called OTT (over-the-top) services, AT&T will not bear distribution costs, including network transport or set-top boxes.At $35 a month, AT&T's package might not include sports channels such as Disney's ESPN.IBD's TAKE: AT&T stock has dropped nearly 7% since reports of the Time Warner deal surfaced and subsequently announced. Time Warner stock is trading at near 87, roughly 20 below AT&T's cash and stock offer of 107.50 per share. Analysts say TWX shareholders may be unsure of regulatory approval.

""However, it will avoid costs for satellites, set-top boxes and installations/trouble-shooting, while also reaching customers who have left the pay TV market or never joined.""Strong growth in this product would support AT&T's vision for the TWX transaction and likely sit well with regulators concerned about the OTT ecosystem.""

Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 29.04 buy point on Sept. 19, but had mostly slipped since then.

154,CHTR,"Comcast (CMCSA) made its $31 billion, all-cash offer for satellite TV broadcaster Sky official on Wednesday, but any notion that a bigger deal for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) is on the horizon may have been put to bed by a company executive.Judging from Comcast's stock movement Wednesday, investors seem to think comments by the cable TV giant's chief financial officer indicate that all the company wants at this point is Sky. Shares were up 4% earlier in the day and ended the regular session 2.7% higher to 34.26.The reason: While Comcast has structured the Sky bid as all cash, it would need to tap equity to bid for Rupert Murdoch's Fox. Further, it would have to outbid Walt Disney (DIS), which in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.When asked about Comcast's view of equity and debt to finance other possible acquisitions, CFO Michael Cavanagh said on the company's earnings call Wednesday: ""I don't see us using stock at these levels, period.""Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

155,CHTR,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start Here""While circumstances can always change, I think it is unlikely that we would use Comcast shares as a medium of exchange for a transaction,"" Cavanagh added later on the earnings call.Fox has made a competing bid for Sky and had been its only official suitor until Comcast confirmed it wanted the U.K.-based company on Wednesday. Comcast in February announced its intention to bid for Sky, sending shares of the cable TV firm down. Comcast has dropped nearly 15% this year.When Comcast targeted Sky, that spurred speculation that they would follow up by bidding for all of Fox, thus sparking a bidding war vs. Disney. Comcast may not be ready, at least for now, to bid for Fox using its equity at depressed levels.""People are taking that (Cavanagh's comments) to mean they won't pursue Fox any further,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.""But that may not be the right reading,"" added Moffett. ""Sky makes a lot more sense with a studio acquisition than without one. Without using equity, Sky and Fox together would mean roughly $100 billion of debt. That's a staggeringly large number, so an all-cash offer is unlikely. But, mathematically, it isn't inconceivable.""An independent committee of the Sky board on Wednesday withdrew their recommendation to accept the Fox offer and terminated the cooperation agreement. Analysts expect Fox to increase its offer for Sky, possibly with Disney's help.Fox owns 39% of Sky and has offered to buy the rest of the company.

156,CHTR,"Shares in Time Warner (TWX) rose for the eighth straight trading day Thursday as investors apparently like AT&T's (T) chances of prevailing in an antitrust court fight against the government over a merger of the two.A federal judge overseeing the case on Wednesday made comments that some observers interpreted as a plus for AT&T. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon asked a government witness from Charter Communications (CHTR) whether AT&T's arbitration offer made to cable and satellite TV companies could be restructured to resolve concerns about the merger.The Department of Justice, which is seeking to block the acquisition, has stated that an arbitration process would be inadequate to address a combined AT&T-Time Warner's negotiating clout over programming distribution. The government, though, approved of Comcast's (CMCSA) acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011 with arbitration included among the deal's conditions. Judge Leon also oversaw the Comcast-NBCUniversal merger approval process.Shares in Time Warner rose 0.5% to close at 96.39 on the stock market today.

229,CHTR,"Charter Communications (CHTR) can't claim its consolation prize from the takeover battle for Time Warner Cable vs. Comcast until federal regulators rule on the industry's biggest proposed merger ever.
"
230,CHTR,"Charter shareholders seem fine with the scenario. Charter's stock has shot up since the company announced a complex deal with Comcast (CMCSA) on April 28.
"
231,CHTR,"If regulators, as expected, approve the merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable (TWC) by year's end or early 2015, Charter would become the second biggest cable TV firm, though Comcast would be more than three times larger in subscribers.

236,CHTR,"Comcast in mid-February agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion. Comcast's all-stock offer beat out Charter's takeover bid. Comcast aims to pare its subscriber gains from the Time Warner Cable deal in order to ease critics' concerns that it'll wield too much clout in broadband services as well as in the entertainment industry.
"
237,CHTR,"Philadelphia-based Comcast would have nearly 33 million pay-TV subscribers if it were to gobble up Time Warner Cable whole.
"
238,CHTR,"Instead, Comcast has agreed to sell Charter 1.4 million subscribers for $7.3 billion in stage one of a deal. In stage two, Comcast would spin off 2.5 million subscribers into a new, Charter-managed public company.
"
239,CHTR,"Charter would use stock to buy a 33% stake in the new company. After two years, Charter could up its stake to 49%. In four years, Charter could buy out Comcast completely and own 100%. The entire deal has been valued at $20 billion.

"
272,CHTR,"Buying Motorola Home from a subsidiary of Google (GOOGL) in April 2013 was especially transformational.
"
273,CHTR,"The $2.2 billion cash deal, plus 10.6 million shares of stock issued to Google, gave Arris new cable TV equipment, including a video set-top box business. Google still owns a 7% stake in Arris.
"
274,CHTR,"""It essentially tripled the size of the company,"" Coyne said.
"
275,CHTR,"Revenue jumped from $1.3 billion in 2012 to $3.6 billion in 2013, which included less than nine months with the Motorola Home cable-gear business under Arris' belt.
"
276,CHTR,"Until the deal, Arris had been focused on a smaller slice of the market — products needed to facilitate high-speed data inside networks and the home, Coyne says.
"
277,CHTR,"Motorola's set-top box business under Google was part of a larger acquisition that the search giant made earlier. But the business had ""lost its footing"" by the time Arris bought it, Coyne said.
"
278,CHTR,"To its credit, he noted, Arris made ""a very impressive rebound.""

306,CHTR,"AT&T (T) can go ahead with its acquisition of Time Warner (TWX), a U.S. District Court judge said late Tuesday, in a ruling that ignited a wave of late trading in telecom and media stocks.U.S. District Judge Richard Leon made the ruling after U.S. stock markets closed on Tuesday. Leon set no conditions on the AT&T takeover.Despite the win, AT&T fell 1.8% to 33.74 in after-hours trades. Time Warner rose 4.7% to 100.70. One analyst said AT&T's slip may involve arbitrage related to the Time Warner transaction.The Department of Justice sued in November 2017 to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner on grounds that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry. AT&T argued that it needs Time Warner's assets to compete with Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in the entertainment business.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIf the Justice Department were to appeal a ruling favorable to AT&T, that could be a problem for the telecom conglomerate. In that event, Time Warner would have the option of walking away from the deal or renegotiating terms with AT&T. The merger agreement expires on June 21.Leon late Tuesday said he wouldn't grant a stay if the government requested one.The ruling in the landmark antitrust case sent shares in Comcast (CMCSA) and Walt Disney (DIS) down as investors now anticipate a bidding war over 21st Century Fox (FOXA). Fox rose 4.8% to 42.50, while Comcast fell 3.6% to 31.25. Shares in Disney were down 1.9% to 102.34.Judge Leon's ruling is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media firms by telecom companies that distribute content over broadband and wireless networks.Comcast could launch an all-cash bid for Rupert Murdoch's Fox as soon as Wednesday. Disney in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in Sky — for $54.4 billion in an all-stock deal.Comcast, which already owns NBCUniversal, has reportedly arranged financing for an all-cash bid. The nation's largest cable TV firm has been waiting for a ruling on the AT&T-Time Warner merger before announcing a formal bid for Fox. Comcast has already bid $31 billion for satellite TV broadcaster Sky, in which Fox holds a 39% stake.The court ruling sent other media stocks up in late trades. CBS (CBS) rose 1.8% to 53.35. John Malone's Discovery Communications (DISCA) climbed 2.9% to 24.72. Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF) shot up 5.6% to 25.48. Charter Communications (CHTR) climbed 1.5% to 295.50.Also, shares in Verizon Communications (VZ) edged up 0.3% to 49. Verizon has stated it's not interested in buying large media assets. But Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) have stated their interest in a marriage. Sprint jumped 3.8% to 5.50 while T-Mobile climbed 1.6% after hours and was near 59.AT&T and Time Warner announced their merger in October 2016.Many analysts had expected AT&T to prevail. Before the court ruling, Time Warner stock traded 10% below AT&T's 107.50-per-share offer. That indicated some investors still thought a DOJ win possible.In Tuesday's regular session, AT&T shares gained 0.5% to close at 34.35 on the stock market today.

308,CHTR,"Doesn't matter if we're surfing the web or watching Netflix (NFLX): We don't care how it works, so long as it works — and works fast.X As cable operators look to modernize their systems in what one brokerage calls ""the largest cable infrastructure capital investment cycle since the mid-1990s,"" broadband solutions provider Casa Systems (CASA) — which just went public in mid-December — already is seen as a well-positioned player that could be a key supplier in that movement.""Competition has become intense,"" Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold said in a recent note to clients in which he initiated coverage of Casa. ""Cable TV operators will continue to invest, and we expect the (capital expenditure) mix shifts toward network infrastructure and away from set-top boxes, which could enable Casa to grow revenue 17% to 22% in 2018-2019.""The Andover, Mass.-based company, founded in 2003, says it offers a suite of ""software-centric infrastructure solutions that allow cable service providers to deliver voice, video and data services over a single platform at multi-gigabit speeds.""Analysts are singing its praises. That software-focused structure has helped Casa to be ""first to market for most major advances in the cable space in the last 10 years,"" William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in his note initiating coverage of the company.Though Casa shares have been choppy — as they are with many IPOs shortly after going public — they have generally moved higher since hitting the market at 13 on Dec. 15. Case in point: shares hit an intraday high of 24.24 in the middle of last week, slipped a bit with the broad market sell-off and then charged ahead again on Monday. Shares had surged nearly 13% to another intraday high of 25.20 Monday and ended the regular session up 7.1% to 23.50.Charter Communications' (CHTR) Time Warner Cable unit is one of Casa's biggest customers, according to Casa's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its initial public offering. Charter made up 36% of its revenue in the first nine months of 2017.But Casa's reach is global. Thanks to an array of customers that includes Rogers Communications (RCI), Liberty Global (LBTYA), Televisa/IZZI Mexico, Vodafone (VOD) and the privately held firms Mediacom and Jupiter Communications, Casa has a presence in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In 2016, more than 58% of Casa's revenue came from North America, while Latin America brought in 15%, and its Europe, Middle East and Africa segments combined made up slightly more than 14%. Asia-Pacific revenue took up an eighth of the pie.In all, Casa raked in $316.1 million in revenue and $88.7 million in net income in fiscal 2016 — up 16% and 30.5%, respectively, from the prior year — as outlined in its IPO filing. The bulk of overall revenue, more than 88%, came from sales of its broadband products. It derived the rest from services.The company's growth is ""underpinned by a structural shift in cable operators' network infrastructure, and we expect this transition to continue for a number of years,"" Raymond James' Leopold wrote. He rated Casa outperform with a 23 price target.Leopold believes Casa can benefit from the challenges facing cable operators — namely, subscriber demand for faster speeds and on-demand content.Charter Communications' latest earnings report points to possible tailwinds for Casa, says one analyst.""Despite the possibility for (Charter's) 2018 capex to be flat to down, we are encouraged by the trajectory of spending that impacts Casa, specifically scalable infrastructure,"" Stifel's Patrick Newton wrote in a recent note, as he rated the stock a buy. ""We would expect this to outpace growth in other areas.""Shares are climbing, up more than 70% from its IPO price of 13 a share on Dec. 15. That was notably lower than the originally anticipated pricing of 15-17 a share, but it has risen sharply since then.The stock boasts a Relative Strength rating of 96 so far, indicating strong outperformance. But earnings results can, of course, knock a stock off course, and Casa management is set to announce its first quarter of earnings and sales as a publicly traded company after the close Tuesday.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportConsensus is for 32 cents in per-share earnings on revenue of $101 million for the fourth quarter.The company faces some formidable challenges, though. For one, Casa's main competitors are Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Arris International (ARRS), much bigger players. Cisco's cable broadband business is but a ""rounding error,"" according to Stifel's Newton.But Northland Capital Markets analyst Tim Savageaux points out that Casa has managed to capture ""significant share"" of the $2 billion Converged Cable Access Platform (CCAP) market from both of its main rivals. He estimates that Casa has 23% market share vs. Cisco's 20% and Arris' 50%.Still, analysts see room for growth as Casa ventures into new segments. Its foray into neighboring network transformation markets, and into technologies with names like remote-PHY cable nodes and mobility software ""more than triples"" the company's total addressable market, said William Blair's Ader, adding that he expects new products to ramp up revenue growth through 2019.That said, Casa's move into the wireless market also means it has more rivals, particularly Ericsson (ERIC), Nokia (NOK) and Huawei, which Ader notes have ""deep pockets and substantially more credibility and experience serving wireless customers.""The pursuit of wireless markets is just one part of a multi-pronged growth strategy outlined in Casa's IPO filing. Management also highlighted plans for research investments, selling more products to existing customers, expanding its base and making ""selective acquisitions.""Accumulating capital for possible mergers might be one reason Casa went public, wrote Ader, as it envisions expanding beyond its existing cable customers.""With the industry going through significant and ongoing consolidation, there should be growing opportunities to acquire interesting technology assets that could fit well with Casa's business and broaden its broadband access and aggregation product portfolio,"" he wrote.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Check Out These Tech Plays If You Like Amazon, Bitcoin, NetflixInternet Of Things Driving MEMS GrowthThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With HandleSurprise!

While T-Mobile has gained subscriber and revenue share vs. AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ), Sprint's brand is still weak in comparison. Sprint's most valuable asset is radio spectrum well-suited for next-generation 5G services.Under a newly proposed deal, ownership would be structured so that Deutsche Telekom could consolidate the combined financial results of T-Mobile and Sprint, while SoftBank still has a say in management, reports said.Even if SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom reach an agreement, the big question is whether the Trump administration will approve a merger that reduces the number of national wireless firms to three from four.A Sprint merger with T-Mobile would create a three-player market, including Verizon and AT&T.The entry of cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) into the wireless market could boost chances of a merger being approved, analysts say.Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has courted President Trump with pledges to invest in the U.S.Japan-based Softbank in October 2012 bought a controlling stake in struggling Sprint. Son soon after pursued a Sprint merger with T-Mobile, but the Obama administration made it clear that it wanted a U.S. wireless market with four national players.Shares in American Tower and Crown Castle sold off on views that capital spending on wireless networks would fall if Sprint and T-Mobile merge.

312,CHTR,"With nearly four months' worth of stock market action in 2018 now in the rear view mirror, the major indexes' story has been this: We let nice gains slip away.The lesson for investors? Don't let your gains do the same.The S&P 500, a 19% gainer in 2017, is down only a touch since Jan. 1. But the large-cap benchmark lost a more than 7% advance during the first 4-1/2 weeks of trading this year.The Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) exchange-traded fund is also down mildly this year. The road has been bumpy for months. Just days ago, the ETF stabbed below its 200-day moving average for the third time since Feb. 9.So far, the ETF has managed to rebound after the two prior tests of the long-term support level. But many stocks in the IBD 50 and outside this list have failed to reach new highs.Earnings and sales have shown robust increases, as seen in first-quarter results hitting equity traders' computer screens these past few weeks. But the market always looks ahead, and it always has something to consider and evaluate. Lately, the sharp rise in yield for the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond appears to be a front-burner issue.A new bull market in crude oil prices and the possibility of accelerating inflation also deserve prominent space in the current market picture.As an IBD-style investor, you'll want to always adjust your holding and selling strategy when the overall market shifts. Right now, with the current outlook at ""uptrend under pressure,"" taking profits more quickly is a smart strategy. If your stock is up, say, 15% from a proper buy point but is showing signs of fatigue, you can at least sell half the shares and keep watching.The longer you've played the game of buying on breakouts in good markets and sitting patiently for the stock to hit the 20% to 25% profit goal, the more likely you've seen a stock come up so close, then retreat fast.In other cases, some IBD 50 names act as if the 20% profit level is merely a pit stop. Indeed, in recent years, scores of high-quality growth stocks have risen 30%, 40%, 50% or even more past a proper buy point before sinking into a real correction. When you have supreme conviction and the overall market is healthy, go ahead and sit longer on your winners.But Casa Systems (CASA), which has occupied a spot in the IBD 50 for months, illustrates the importance of not being too greedy.The specialist in software for the cable and telecom markets debuted on the Nasdaq at 13 a share on Dec. 15, formed a very narrow IPO base in February, then broke out past a 22.60 entry on Feb. 27. On that day, the market was in a confirmed uptrend, thanks to a follow-through rally. Less than four weeks later, Casa hit a high of 34.21, up a stout 51%.Taking at least some gains turned out to be sound portfolio management. Casa cooled off and tried to clear a faulty cup base that lasted just four weeks. On April 24, shares plunged nearly 12% and undercut the 50-day moving average for the first time on news of a share offering. Two days later, Casa priced 7 million shares at 25 each. The share float was 20 million.Casa is also likely getting knocked by news that Charter Communications (CHTR) reported worse than expected results in video subscriber losses.Here's a quick look at some other IBD 50 names' recent action.Abiomed (ABMD): It's holding up fine after fading after a breakout past 304.38 in a new flat base. The base is late stage, a key risk. Keep in mind that the gains from a March 2017 breakout at 120.99 have hit 150%.Smart Global (SGH): Made a round trip after rising past a buy point in March and catapulting over four weeks. The stock made a sharp retreat, even after earnings roared 652% higher to $1.73 a share in the quarter ended in February. Revenue rose 83% to $314 million.Illumina (ILMN): A base next to a base is forming. Clear resistance is seen near 250.Viper Energy Partners (VNOM): Is not giving much back after it cleared a base with a 26.29 buy point. Gains have so far hit 13% amid a new bull run for crude oil prices.You can trade the IBD 50 in one click with Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY), managed by Innovator Capital.

313,CHTR,"Telecom mergers may be on the back-burner as regulators vow to block the nuptials of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), but talk during recent industry earnings calls are leading Wall Street analysts to believe there still are possible combinations to be had out there.X The prevailing view is that deals are on hold until AT&T either wins or loses in its battle with the Department of Justice, which is seeking to thwart the telecom giant's purchase of Time Warner. A trial is slated to start March 19, with a federal judge expected to rule on the case by late April or May.Referring to AT&T-DOJ court battle, T-Mobile US (TMUS) Chief Executive John Legere, on his company's earnings call Feb. 9, said there's ""a huge pent-up bubble of logical things that need to happen"" in the telecom industry.One wild card in merger speculation is an agreement forged by Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) in May 2017. The two cable TV firms agreed not to make a wireless acquisition for a year unless they obtained each other's approval. That pact expires in the spring.T-Mobile's Legere told analysts that cable TV firms are likely to be involved in a wireless merger at some stage.""It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when,"" he said. T-Mobile and Sprint (S) shelved their merger talks in early November.Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, continue to speculate over potential merger partners.Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar says cable TV firm Charter could target Altice USA (ATUS). Both Charter and Altice operate in the New York City area, he noted in a report. Altice could be a seller rather than a buyer as its Europe-based parent company restructures, analysts say.Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet on Feb. 7 upgraded Dish Network (DISH) to buy on views that the satellite broadcaster could be purchased, though no deal seems imminent.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.Verizon Communications (VZ) CEO Lowell McAdam, on its January earnings call, said ""there is nothing going on right now"" in terms of acquiring a media or other company. Verizon has been viewed as a buyer of Dish or CBS.CBS and Viacom (VIA), meanwhile, have confirmed talks over a possible recombination after splitting up in 2006.While reports resurfaced on Monday that Comcast could rebid for assets of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), the cable TV firm is likely to wait until the outcome of the AT&T-DOJ battle, analysts say. Walt Disney (DIS) in December agreed to buy Fox's film, television and international businesses.If the DOJ successfully blocks AT&T's purchase of Time Warner, that would make other telecom-media mergers less likely, analysts say. In that case, Comcast and Charter could try to merge to gain scale vs. a combined Disney/Fox.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:When To Sell Stocks — Rules That Help You Protect Profits And Avoid LossesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy Way2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains

AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA) are the incumbent service providers in the first market targeted, Sacramento, Calif.Verizon expects a ""broader opportunity"" in 2019, depending on how next year's rollout goes. Verizon says its 5G wireless broadband technology could reach up to 30 million households, about 25%-30% of the U.S. market.""We do not consider Comcast likely to be nervous just yet,"" said Jeffrey Kvaal, a Nomura-Instinet analyst, in a report.Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research, said in a note to clients that Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) has pulled back on its fiber-based broadband services.""Google Fiber was here once upon a time, and much more was known about the cost of deployment and the capabilities of the network — and it still died. It looks like we won't know how committed Verizon is to this or how much of a threat it will be until this time next year,"" Chaplin said.UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a report: ""We believe (Verizon's) announcement suggests the impact to cable will be very small and potentially imperceptible in 2018 and longer-term would depend on the viability of the business plan.""Verizon will have more data on pricing and subscriber penetration after it enters the initial three to five markets in 2018, analysts say.The 30 million U.S. homes that Verizon says can be reached with 5G services would be outside areas where it sells FiOS broadband services.

338,CHTR,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode.

339,CHTR,"Internet service providers such as AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) could get a bigger-than-expected lift from overhauled net neutrality rules under a preliminary proposal from Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.Pai let trickle some key elements of his proposal via a commentary piece he wrote that appeared in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. As expected, Pai proposed that the telecom agency eliminate public-utility-type Title 2 regulations that were foisted on internet service providers by the Obama administration. The Title 2 rules are part of the Communications Act of 1934.Pai may in principle retain rules that bar ISPs from blocking or slowing web content, although they won't be enforced under Title 2 authority.""I look forward to returning to the light-touch, market-based framework that unleashed the digital revolution and benefited consumers here and around the world,"" Pai said in a news release.The Republican-led FCC will vote on Pai's proposal at its Dec. 14 meeting.There's speculation Pai's proposal could open the door to these service providers to seek fees from content producers or business partners for internet ""fast lanes"" or ""paid prioritization.""

With the FCC transparency requirement and the restoration of the FTC's role in overseeing information services, the agencies together will have the authority to take action against any (service provider) which does not make its open internet practices clearly known to consumers, and if needed enforce against any anti-competitive or deceptive practices.""RELATED:Why AT&T's Antitrust Battle May Quash Other Media MegamergersHow Hulu Live, YouTube TV Are Helping AT&T, Dish StreamingCable TV's Hail Mary: Hike Broadband Prices Amid Cord-Cutting

343,CHTR,"Merger talks that seem to have failed between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) rattled the telecom industry on Monday as investors sent up shares of Charter Communications (CHTR) and Dish Network (DISH) as possible partners for Sprint and T-Mobile — and boosted the fortunes of cellphone tower companies as well — while other telecom firms fell.XCharter gained 3.9% to 348.40 on speculation that Softbank could renew takeover talks with the No. 2 cable TV firm behind Comcast (CMCSA).  Cable industry pioneer John Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBDRA) is the biggest shareholder in Charter. Over the summer, Charter signaled that it's not interested in being acquired by Softbank.Meanwhile, Dish Network, another potential Sprint partner, climbed 5.7% to 50.82 on speculation it could eventually end up as a T-Mobile partner.The on-again, off-again talks between Sprint parent Softbank and T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom collapsed over the weekend with both sides saying the deal is finally off. Sprint plunged 11.5% to close at 5.90 on the stock market today. T-Mobile lost 5.7% to finish at 55.54.AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) slipped as investors fretted that wireless competition will re-intensify after a brief lull. A merger combining Sprint and T-Mobile would have reduced the number of national wireless firms to three from four.""With T-Mobile and Sprint officially ending negotiations, we think we are likely back to a more challenging situation than we witnessed pre-election, with four players battling it out for market share,"" UBS analyst John Hodulik said in a note to clients. ""We believe competition will heat up after the recent abnormal lull as the holiday selling season begins, the Apple iPhone X becomes available and cable enters the mix.""IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile had been on the rise until early May, when it slipped into a flat base, where it's remained ever since. It was the top-ranked company in IBD's Telecom Services-Wireless Group but has since slipped to fourth place, behind Shenandoah Telecom, Mitel Networks and Boingo Wireless.

344,CHTR,"The Department of Justice's antitrust battle with AT&T (T) likely will quash near-term megamergers involving media companies, such as 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), analysts say.XOn the other hand, if AT&T winds up acquiring Time Warner (TWX) as planned, more so-called vertical mergers involving media, telecom or internet companies might quickly follow in a new competitive landscape, they add.The Trump administration's crackdown on AT&T will make other companies leery of making media acquisitions, says Andy Hargreaves, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets.""The DOJ's lawsuit significantly increases uncertainty around the application of antitrust law. This is likely to dramatically slow the pace of M&A in media, and possibly other industries,"" Hargreaves said in a note to clients.The Department of Justice announced Monday it is suing to block AT&T's merger with media giant Time Warner. The DOJ says the megamerger would be harmful to consumers because the combined company might extract higher prices for Time Warner content from other video distributors such as Dish Network (DISH) or Charter Communications (CHTR).AT&T could also try to withhold content from emerging internet video rivals, such as Amazon.com (AMZN) or Apple (AAPL), asserts the DOJ.Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox has reportedly engaged in talks with Walt Disney (DIS), Comcast (CMCSA), Amazon, and Verizon Communications (VZ), according to reports.John Hodulik, a UBS analyst says Fox is unlikely to made a deal until the AT&T case is resolved.""We expect the industry to be in a holding pattern pending final determination but continue to believe secular shifts will drive further M&A over the long-term,"" Hodulik said in his report.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.AT&T agreed to buy Time Warner for $85 billion in October 2016. AT&T has raised significant debt to finance the deal, notes a Wells Fargo report. AT&T aims for an expedited trial, with a court decision in 4 to 6 months.The DOJ has asked AT&T to sell off Turner Broadcasting or its DirecTV satellite business to gain approval. AT&T says no divestitures are required by law. The DOJ says it's not interested in placing conditions on AT&T as it did on Comcast in 2011, when the cable TV firm bought NBCUniversal. The conditions on Comcast expire in 2018.Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a report says the lawsuit's outcome will shape future M&A. If AT&T wins and no programming access conditions are placed on the deal, Moffett said: ""The only feasible alternative for distribution competitors would be to acquire their own content, either to differentiate their services from AT&T's or, alternatively, to threaten mutually assured destruction if AT&T's (Time Warner) content were to be withheld.""RELATED:AT&T Calls Out CNN Issue As DOJ Moves To Block Time Warner DealAT&T, Time Warner Deal In Distress?

He says the average broadband price, including customers that buy a bundle of high-speed internet and TV services, is now about $49 monthly.""Cable companies are likely to raise stand-alone broadband pricing in order to combat the EBITDA declines from downsizing,"" said McCormack in a report. ""This practice is already evident and justified given the lack of a bundling discount. Based on our analysis, we estimate Comcast would need to raise stand-alone pricing to roughly $80 in order to break even from a profitability perspective.""He says that Comcast, in some markets, has brought in stand-alone broadband customers with $40 monthly promotions and has been able to hike prices to $65 monthly.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read  The Big Picture at the day's end (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Comcast shares have dropped 11% since early September when it forecast higher-than-expected subscriber losses in the September quarter, normally seasonally strong for cable TV companies.

349,CHTR,"The media industry is ""likely one more deal away from potentially reshaping the landscape for at least a decade,"" said Barclays analysts in a lengthy dissection of the entertainment and telecom sectors following confirmation of the $85.4 billion merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX).But there are a number of other scenarios in play, especially with CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB) being forcefully nudged toward merger talks by Sumner Redstone's National Amusements, and even reports of Disney (DIS) potentially being interested in Netflix (NFLX).Could the latter be the landscape-changing deal?The House of Mouse, which owns ABC, ESPN, Marvel, Lucasfilm and has an investment in streamer BAMTech, is missing a key direct-to-consumer business, in Barclays' view, and its streaming efforts aren't coming soon enough to help offset ESPN's subscriber-loss issues.Streaming heavyweight Netflix would significantly bolster Disney's distribution and technological capabilities, Barclays said.But such a combination is unlikely, according to media reports. And comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger about the complementary, supplemental nature of an online ESPN-branded channel point to the conglomerate wanting to keep its premium cable network a sports destination and a valued cable-bundle component.""We have no misconceptions about how disruptive the deal could be to the Disney culture given a potentially toxic mix of Hollywood and technology mindsets having to coexist,"" said Barclays. ""However, we believe if there was ever a time to take this risk, it would probably be now given that technology players are for the first time outlining a real vision around video instead of the small scale experiments thus far.

350,CHTR,"T-Mobile US (TMUS) stock hit a nine-year high Monday as Q3 earnings topped views, the company raised guidance and speculation of wireless industry M&A heated up in the wake of AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of Time Warner (TWX).Asked about the AT&T-Time Warner deal on T-Mobile's earnings conference call, T-Mobile CEO John Legere said: ""It's a bold move. It's going to cause acceleration. It's good for T-Mobile in the short and medium term.""Analysts say Comcast (CMCSA) could speed up its push into wireless, perhaps by acquiring T-Mobile in partnership with Charter Communications (CHTR). Both Comcast and Charter have agreements to lease access to Verizon Communications' (VZ) wireless network. But Legere said that's not a viable long-term strategy.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock gapped past a 48.21 flat-base buy point in fast turnover to mark a nine-year high. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Some analysts say regulators now might be more open to a Sprint (S) merger with T-Mobile, as AT&T grows larger through the acquisitions of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV and now media giant Time Warner — if regulators approve that latter deal. Telecom industry merger talks, though, are on hold until the completion of a government auction of radio spectrum.Legere said AT&T could become ""further defocused"" on wireless as it invests in new businesses. ""There's upside for us"" in subscriber growth, he said.""There is a piece of the industry of the future that they (AT&T) are attempting to define,"" added Legere. ""(AT&T CEO Stephenson) Randall's short version is something I've been saying for a long time, that video is going mobile and mobile is going video.""He says regulators will prevent AT&T from using Time Warner's content exclusively on its networks.T-Mobile on Monday reported higher-than-expected Q3 profit and raised full-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) guidance as its wireless subscriber additions again led the industry.Shares of the ""Uncarrier""-branded wireless firm jumped 9.5% in the stock market today, to 51.19, their highest price since August 2007.""Despite T-Mobile's consistently strong operating story, people will inevitably focus on M&A,"" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, in a research report.T-Mobile said Q3 earnings minus items jumped 80% from the year-earlier quarter to 27 cents. Analysts had modeled 22 cents. Revenue rose 18% to $9.2 billion vs. consensus estimates of $9.43 billion.T-Mobile forecast full-year adjusted EBITDA of $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion, up from its earlier guidance of $9.95 billion at the midpoint of its range.Apple (AAPL) rolled out the iPhone 7 in September, and T-Mobile and Sprint ramped up ""free"" iPhone trade-in promotions, grabbing share from AT&T and Verizon.""The EBITDA guidance raise is an incremental positive to T-Mobile's profitability and FCF story,"" said Jennifer Fritzsche, a Wells Fargo analyst, in a report. ""The slight top-line miss was due to lower-than-expected equipment revenue, which we believe was partially due to TMUS' 'free' iPhone 7 promotion in September.""Bellevue, Wash.-based T-Mobile added 851,000 postpaid phone lines in Q3, about the same as in Q3 2015. Sprint added 347,000 postpaid phone lines in Q3, the company preannounced last week, with full earnings out Tuesday. AT&T lost 268,000 postpaid phone lines, while Verizon shed 36,000 postpaid phone lines.RELATED:How Aggressive AT&T Has Out-Maneuvered Verizon, ComcastConsumer Groups Knock AT&T-Time Warner Merger

351,CHTR,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

352,CHTR,"Companies that sell internet access would need subscribers' permission before using or sharing sensitive information including web browsing history under a proposal announced Thursday by the Federal Communications Commission.The agency is to vote Oct. 27 on the plan by Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat, to set rules that have been resisted by internet service providers led by AT&T (T) and top U.S. cable provider Comcast (CMCSA).""The information you share with your broadband provider is yours,"" Wheeler said in a blog post. ""With the FCC's new privacy protections, you will have the right to determine how it's used.""IBD'S TAKE: A day after partnering with IBM, AT&T is ""netbonding"" with Amazon Web Services.AT&T, Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast and fellow cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR) see that Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook (FB) have amassed riches by profiling web users and selling targeted advertisements, and they want to get into the game, too. Verizon, for instance, is gaining a toehold in the $187 billion digital advertising market with its purchase of Yahoo (YHOO).The FCC has authority over telephone and cable companies.

353,CHTR,"The drum roll goes on for AT&T's (T) launch of ""DirecTV Now,"" an 100-plus-channel Internet video service, as the industry waits for AT&T to announce its pricing for the service.AT&T is expected to launch DirecTV Now this quarter.How much cable TV rivals such as Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) need to worry about the DirecTV Now launch depends a lot on its pricing.And AT&T's pricing also could impact the strategies of Hulu, which is expected to launch a new live streaming TV service in early 2017; Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and other new entrants in the so-called OTT, or over-the-top, video market.""If they price too aggressively, there is an obvious risk of cannibalization,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett said via email. ""They make very attractive margins on their legacy DTV business today.""Offering an internet-based alternative will mean lower costs, particularly for equipment, so they can justify a lower price. But that doesn't mean they can justify pricing at razor thin margins. That would be cutting off their nose to spite their face.""Nomura Securities weighed in on Friday, saying AT&T might bite the bullet on mid-single-digit profit margins and sell DirecTV Now for $55 monthly. UBS analyst John Hodulik earlier estimated that AT&T could sell DirecTV Now for $50 a month.""We view DirecTV Now as a potential game-changer, but with two caveats: The customer is not locked into a contract and Hulu is expected to launch a competing OTT product in early 2017,"" Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a research report Friday.Hulu's live streaming service is expected to cost around $40 a month.IBD'S TAKE: High-dividend paying stocks such as AT&T and Verizon have cooled off amid talk that interest rates may rise. Some large cap companies, such as Facebook or Edwards Lifesciences, offer faster growth. Check out the IBD Big Cap 20.Hulu is a joint venture of 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), Walt Disney (DIS)and Comcast. Time Warner (TWX) recently bought a 10% stake in Hulu.At a Goldman Sachs conference in September, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said DirecTV Now will roll out at a ""very, very aggressive price point. Stephenson said AT&T will accept thinner margins than usual in the pay TV business.Still, there's wiggle room in AT&T's comments because DirecTV Now has been described at a fat bundle, with a lot of content, not a skinny bundle with fewer channels. AT&T announced plans for DirecTV Now in January.Programming will be AT&T's biggest cost. AT&T has lined up content from most media firms, with the exception of CBS (CBS) and 21st Century Fox Entertainment, analysts say. But there may be other costs.William Power, an analyst at William Blair, says AT&T might use Akamai Technologies' (AKAM) content delivery network to whisk Internet video to homes.Akamai's services might be needed because AT&T's DirecTV Now will stream live TV, including sports. AT&T will provide one or two data streams per household. For wireless customers, DirecTV Now usage will not count toward monthly data caps.UBS estimates DirecTV Now could have 2.5 million customers by 2020. Hodulik is cautious on forecasts because OTT competition will likely heat up.""We believe Amazon is well underway with developing a linear TV service, and we doubt that Apple (AAPL) has permanently shelved its plans,"" he said in a research report.AT&T stock fell 0.6% to 38.87 in the stock market today.RELATED:AT&T Downgraded On Apple iPhone Competition, Comcast Wireless EntryIPhone 7 Bottom Line: 'Apple's Gain, Carriers' Pain'

The unemployment rate ticked higher to 5%.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite lost 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2%. The Nasdaq ended the week just above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 ended the week below its 50-day line, and the Dow marked its fifth straight weekly close below the line. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly higher than Thursday. Nasdaq volume fell slightly.December gold settled at $1,251.90 an ounce, down $1.10, or 0.1%. For the week, it lost around 5%. West Texas intermediate crude oil lost 1.3% to $49.81 a barrel. For the week, it rose just over 3%.Among blue chips, Honeywell crashed below its 200-day moving average, falling 7.5%, after the company lowered its full-year earnings and sales forecasts.Elsewhere, Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) jumped 3.5% after the chip firm raised its third-quarter sales guidance.IBD'S TAKE: Silicon Motion has been a mainstay in the IBD 50, a proprietary list of leading growth stocks.Elsewhere, Acacia Communications (ACIA) slumped nearly 9% to 100 after the fiber-optic gear maker priced a follow-on share offering at 100. Acacia closed below its 50-day line for the first time since it came public in May.Among retailers, Burlington Stores (BURL) bucked the trend, rising nearly 2%. It's showing supporting action around its 10-week moving average after a breakout from a long consolidation in late May. Gap (GPS), meanwhile, gapped up over its 50- and 200-day moving averages, rising 15% after the company reported better-than-expected sales in September. Deutsche Bank upgraded shares to hold from sell.Arris International (ARRS) also bucked the trend, rising nearly 7% to 29.65. After a pullback to its 50-day moving average, it's back above a 29.04 entry.

355,CHTR,"Apple (AAPL) hired former Time Warner Cable executive Peter Stern to oversee cloud services, which suggests that the tech giant may be more serious about streaming TV services.Apple has flirted with providing a streaming TV service for years, but negotiations have faltered.Stern left TWC after it was acquired by Charter Communications (CHTR) earlier this year. But he was involved in some of those talks between Apple and media giants. Stern will run cloud services, which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay iTunes and iCloud. He will report to Eddy Cue, who reportedly took a tough line in streaming TV negotiations.Dish Network (DISH) has its own Sling TV skinny network streaming TV service, while Sony (SNE) has the Playstation Vue.Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) announced a pact with Liberty Global (LBTYA) to be on its cable set-top boxes in more than 30 countries. That follows a Netflix deal with Comcast (CMCSA) earlier this year.Apple shares rose 3.5% to 111.77, boosted by generally strong iPhone 7 pre-orders as well as Samsung's exploding Note smartphone fiasco.

356,CHTR,"Shares of Arris International (ARRS), the No. 1 maker of set-top boxes offered by traditional pay-TV companies, rose Monday as analysts said the FCC's efforts to open up the set-top market won't have much impact on Arris for years, if ever.Arris stock fell 5% Friday — knocking it down from near a potential buy point — after FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler unveiled the agency's latest proposal to open up the market. The new proposal backs away from the FCC's original idea of forcing cable, telecom and satellite pay-TV providers to stream video to Roku, Apple's (AAPL) Apple TV and other makers of third-party set-tops. Instead, it requires the pay-TV companies provide apps through which their programming can be obtained through the third-party set-tops.The FCC is set to vote on the proposal on Sept. 29. It's a little more friendly to Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ), AT&T (T) and the other pay-TV providers, but still has the potential to open up the market.IBD'S TAKE: Arris stock last week almost reached a buy point of 29.04 out of a cup-with-handle base. Shares showed support at the key 50-day line. It's important to be able to read the most common chart patterns, a skill you can master at IBD University.Still, Needham and RBC Capital Markets maintained buy and outperform ratings, respectively, on Arris stock, in research reports released Monday and late Friday. Needham analyst Richard Valera and RBC's Mitch Steves both pointed out that the cable companies would have two years to develop the apps and that it could be much longer because of likely litigation.Moreover, they said there is a solid chance the FCC won't approve the change, and they said the pay-TV boxes still would likely perform much more seamlessly.Approval, however, is expected. ""We find it hard to spin it as anything but a win for consumers and negative for providers of traditional video (set-top boxes) like ARRS,"" wrote Valera.He also said Arris, in any case, has a ""seat at the table"" with the third-party boxes, through its acquisition last year of ActiveVideo, which provides such software. Arris bought ActiveVideo for $135 million in partnership with cable firm Charter Communications (CHTR).Friday's stock ""pullback was overdone,"" wrote RBC's Steves.Arris stock rose 1.2% in the stock market today, to 27.06. But the stock has fallen more than 25% since touching a 16-year high above 37 in April 2015.Steves has a price target of 33 on Arris stock, while Valera has a target of 32.In August, Arris promoted 17-year company veteran Bruce McClelland to CEO, with CEO Bob Sanzione becoming executive chairman.

357,CHTR,"Do you invest as successfully as Fidelity Investments does? Would it help your game to know in which large-cap stocks Fidelity's approximately 200 stock and stock-plus-bond mutual funds made some of their biggest second-quarter adds to and sells from?Todd Rosenbluth, S&P Global Market Intelligence director of mutual fund research, pored through the newly released SEC holdings disclosure of the second-largest mutual fund manager and compared it with past filings by the Boston-based behemoth, which had $1.4 trillion in long-term assets as of June 30.The snapshot of Q2 trades gives insight into what stocks Fidelity managers thought were worth getting into and what they were willing to trim.Information technology remained the fund giant's largest sector, with 23% of its collective assets as of June 30. That was the case even though many Fidelity managers sold shares in two tech titans, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), in the second quarter. Fidelity trimmed its Microsoft share count by 20% compared with its Q1 stake. It peeled Apple back by 6.9%.Microsoft's stock fell 7% in Q2, but has rallied 13% since June 30. No word yet on whether Fidelity resumed buying.Apple's shares sank 12% in Q2, but have rallied 14% since then.In contrast, Fidelity beefed up its shares in home entertainment software stock Activision Blizzard (ATVI) by 92%. ""In Feburary 2016, ATVI completed its purchase of King Digital and reported first and second quarter results ahead of the Capital IQ consensus,"" Rosenbluth reported to clients. On Thursday afternoon shares were about where they closed at the end of Q2.The stock ended June 17% higher than where it began the quarter. It's been about flat since then.In the health care sector, Fidelity was both a net buyer and seller.Fidelity liked the prognosis for biotech firm Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) enough to graft an additional 48% onto its existing share count. That turned out to be a good call. In July, Vertex got FDA approval for a new cystic fibrosis drug, Rosenbluth notes. Now shares are up 15% since the end of Q2.Going in the other director, Fidelity sliced 18% from its Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stake and 3.8% from its UnitedHealth Group (UNH) holding. Both are about where they ended Q2.In other sectors, Fidelity added to its stakes in cell-tower owner American Tower (AMT), cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR) and carmaker Tesla Motors (TSLA). Fidelity added 20% to its positions in each.American Tower is about where it was on June 30. Charter is up 11%. The stock is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity from analysts, says Zacks Equity Research. Still, Charter's telecom services-integrated industry group is ranked 66, down from 43 four weeks ago.Tesla is up fractionally from where it closed Q2.Among stocks that Fidelity trimmed in Q2 were Amazon (AMZN), cut by 1.3%, and Visa (V), shaved by 1.9%.Fidelity's largest stock mutual funds continue to hold many of the largest megacap stocks, even those that the fund family as a group trimmed in Q2, Rosenbluth said. The $19.4 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) has top-10 holdings in Apple and Visa. Other top 10 stocks included Tesla, which the complex added to.Blue Chip Growth is up 1.96% this year going into Thursday, vs. 3.42% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 8.29% for the S&P 500.The $7.5 billion Dividend Growth (FDGFX) held trim targets Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. Dividend Growth is up 5.02% this year.In separate data, Morningstar Inc. highlights stocks that funds have added to recently. The $109 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), managed by Will Danoff since 1990, has interesting adds.Contrafund, which is among the largest stock mutual funds available, has added to B2Gold. The Canadian-based gold producer runs mines globally. As of midday Friday, shares were up 209% so far this year.Earnings per share grew 95%, 69%, 46% and 52% the past four quarters. But note that the shares are trading just above 4 and have never reached 5.Contrafund holds about a dozen mining stocks and has boosted its stakes recently in half of them.Itau Unibanco (ITUB) is another name in which Contrafund has raised its stake. The Brazilian bank holding company's ADRs are up 73% so far this year.EPS has declined for six quarters in a row, but analysts see expect a 4% gain in the current quarter and a 5% increase in 2017.The company has a so-so Composite Rating from IBD of 78. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating. You should look for stocks whose rating is 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Alan Elliot explains why a high Comp Rating is not always a buy signal.Itau also has IBD's SMR Rating of B. SMR Ratings of A and B are the best.And Contrafund opened a stake in Applied Materials (AMAT) as of its latest disclosure.EPS went from a 4% decline three quarters ago to 17% and 52% growth in the two most recent frames.That 52% EPS gain was reported for Q3 on Thursday and it topped Wall Street expectations.But Applied's Q3 revenue, up 13%, were slightly below analysts' consensus. The maker of chipmaking equipment posted revenue of $2.82 billion in the period, falling short of Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $2.84 billion.For the current quarter ending in October, Applied Materials expects its per-share earnings to range from 61 cents to 69 cents.The stock gapped up 7% on huge volume Friday. The semiconductor equipment maker's shares are up 58% so far this year.

358,CHTR,"Google's decision to rethink its broadband services strategy is a plus for AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR), but it's much too early for entrenched internet service providers to declare victory.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is putting plans to expand super-fast fiber optic services on hold while it explores less-expensive wireless technologies. The Google Fiber service for now remains available in just five markets.The Federal Communications Commission plans to open up a swath of unlicensed airwaves in the 3.5 GHz frequency band. Google has been testing wireless broadband using those airwaves.Google Fiber provides internet speeds of 1 gigabit per second and above, with connections that are highly reliable. Does a Google-branded wireless broadband service now pose less of a threat to AT&T, Comcast, Charter, Verizon Communications (VZ) and other ISPs?""I think it is too early to draw that conclusion,"" Blair Levin, former chief of staff to the FCC chairman, told IBD. ""If wireless works for Google, the number of places where it could deploy a faster, better, cheaper network would expand greatly, expanding the level of threat.""""Cable is certainly in the strongest position, but whether Google's announcement represents a diminished or greater threat is still unknown and depends largely on what ... deployment costs and service quality turns out to be,"" said Levin, also former director of the FCC's National Broadband Plan.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, has a similar view.""It's hard to say whether this is a genuine pullback or whether it is simply a pause to consider alternative technologies. At the very least, this will slow things down for a while, since testing wireless alternatives will take a fair amount of time,"" Moffett told IBD.""It's still too early to say whether wireless will pose a significant threat to wired broadband. That's certainly the intent, and it works well in controlled lab settings, but we're still in the early days,"" said Moffett. ""There are still a lot more questions than answers about how it will perform in the real world.""IBD'S TAKE: A Q2 beat propelled Alphabet stock to a new high, and it's a member of the IBD Big Cap 20. These stocks can make big gains with less volatility than smaller caps. Tech names have made the list as of late.Google in June acquired Webpass, which provides fixed wireless broadband services in San Francisco, San Diego, Miami, Chicago, Boston and Oakland, Calif.""The current delay either means the 3.5 (GHz) spectrum is ready for real testing and/or fiber is more expensive than they thought,"" added Levin, now a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""I think it is still unknown whether Google will be successful, but the last several months suggest a combination of new thinking and course corrections to achieve the goal of deploying faster, better, cheaper networks.""Google Fiber is available in parts of Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Kansas City, Mo., and neighboring Kansas City, Kan.; as well as San Antonio. Google announced plans early in 2015 to expand the service to Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Raleigh-Durham, N.C.; and Salt Lake City. Google has also touted plans to expand its fiber-based services to large cities, perhaps including Chicago or Los Angeles.Alphabet stock was down 0.6 to 801.19 at the close on the stock market today, but shares touched an all-time high of 813.88 on Thursday and were up 18% from late June.

360,CHTR,"When AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) report earnings, there's a good reason why analysts that follow Dycom Industries (DY) sit up and take notice.Dycom, an installer of fiber-optic wiring, has prospered as phone and cable TV companies hurry to deploy super-fast, one gigabit-per-second internet services to homes. Dycom digs small trenches where fiber-optic wiring is buried, breaks up and repairs sidewalks if needed, or strings the fiber wiring aerially to homes and business via utility poles.AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Google, as well as CenturyLink (CTL), are Dycom's biggest customers. Any updates on the capital spending plans of phone and cable TV firms are key for Dycom. If new projects are signaled on earnings calls, Dycom and rivals rev up to bid on contracts in local markets.Web video is driving the need for faster internet speeds now, with virtual reality expected to push broadband speeds higher. There's plenty of talk about faster, fifth-generation wireless networks, but fiber optic broadband speeds are forecast to evolve from 1 gigabit -- or 1 billion bits of information -- per second to 10 gigabits per second.""As much as everyone thinks about wireless usage, people are realizing the need for fatter pipes in the ground, and the foundation of that plumbing is fiber,"" said Jennifer Fritzsche, analyst at Wells Fargo.Dycom's stock has climbed more than 20% in 2016, with surging revenue from telecom customers driving earnings growth.Internet companies like Google rely on fast broadband connections. Aiming to pressure telecom firms into upgrading broadband networks to higher speeds, Google has ramped up its own superfast fiber-optic services to homes and businesses.Dycom management has never named Alphabet as a customer. Analysts contend, though, that Alphabet is Dycom's ""unnamed"" customer in earnings releases and accounted for 7% of fiscal-third-quarter revenue.Where Google is heading with its broadband strategy has been a worry for Dycom shareholders. On Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call in July, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said it may use innovative wireless technologies to speed up its roll-out of gigabit internet services. In early August, Alphabet said it would put on hold plans to expand Google Fiber to new markets.Right now, Google Fiber is available only in San Antonio; Austin, Texas; Provo, Utah; Kansas City, Mo., and neighboring Kansas City, Kan.  Alphabet plans to test wireless broadband in up to 24 markets over the next 18 months.Dycom stock fell last week on the news over Google's building ""pause"". But, some analysts say there's still plenty growth coming from AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink and Comcast. And, Fritzsche says Google will need to deploy some fiber-optic plant in neighborhoods, even if wireless links reach homes directly.IBD'S TAKE: Dycom gapped out of a cup-with-handle base after reporting earnings in late May, jumping into IBD's Leaderboard for a while.  Shares fell below its 50-day moving average last week amid speculation over Google's plans. Dycom is No. 2 on  IBD's Telecom-Infrastructure group with a 96 Composite Rating, just behind Ubiquiti Networks.AT&T has touted plans to expand its GigaPower broadband service to some 12.5 million homes and businesses by the end of 2019. In January, AT&T signaled it may target 14 million homes or more, up from its current 2.2 million.More than 26% of Dycom's first-quarter revenue came from AT&T alone. In the first quarter, AT&T revenue rose 70% to $178 million.To hit or exceed its 2019 goals for GigaPower, AT&T needs to step on the accelerator, says Adam Thalhimer, analyst at BB&T Capital Markets. AT&T plans to expand GigaPower from 20 markets to 56 markets across the country.""If you look at the math, it's suggesting some very intense construction years in 2017 and 2018, and Dycom should benefit,"" Thalhimer said.Then there's Verizon. On its first-quarter call in April, Verizon touted plans to expand its FiOS services to Boston and, perhaps, other East Coast cities. The FiOS network now reaches 18 million homes and buildings, but Verizon had stopped expanding that service in 2010.And don't forget Comcast, which was Dycom's second-biggest customer in its fiscal third quarter. Aside from its consumer-focused gigabit push, Comcast has been expanding its high-speed internet network to small and medium-sized businesses. Dycom's second-quarter revenue from Comcast rose 47% to $96 million.Charter Communications (CHTR) is another customer ramping up business services. Cable TV firms in general are pushing optical fiber deeper into networks, replacing the old ""coaxial"" lines.Analysts say there's also upside for Dycom from the Connect America Fund program -- federal government funding aimed at bringing speedier broadband services to rural areas. On Dycom's first-quarter earnings call, Nielsen described it as a $150 million to $200 million annual opportunity through 2020. Phone companies that get Connect America funding include AT&T, Frontier Communications (FTR), CenturyLink and Windstream (WIN).One issue for investors, though, is whether the potential upside from companies deploying super-fast internet services is already built into Dycom's stock. Short interest in Dycom stock is high.On Dycom's fiscal third-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Steven Nielsen said Dycom's revenue from the gigabit gold mine hasn't peaked.""We're in the early stages,"" he said, referring to a new upgrade cycle in wireline networks. Nielsen wasn't available for an interview.Analysts look at Dycom's backlog to sift out data on new contracts. Dycom ended its fiscal third quarter with a total backlog of $5.65 billion, up 97% from a year earlier, and a 12-month backlog of $2.2 billion, up 37%.""Backlog has been inflecting very positively over the past couple of quarters, the trend is good,"" said Bobby Burleson, analyst  at Canaccord Genuity. ""Backlog is projects that have been bid and won. Eventually they come off backlog as projects go live. It might take three years to complete. It's a forward indicator of revenue.""Another issue for investors is whether Dycom's EBITDA -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- will shrink as the company adds labor and equipment for new projects. Working capital costs rise as it wins new business. With 12,500 employees, Dycom could add thousands more over the next three to four years, some analysts say.""What we've said, and what we've executed against, is that we think a mid-teens EBITDA business is attainable,"" CEO Nielsen said on Dycom's first-quarter call.Based in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., Dycom is slated to report fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings in late August. Dycom's profit should jump 60% to $1.55 per share, with revenue growing 33% to $771 million, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Phone companies account for nearly two-thirds of Dycom's revenue, and cable TV firms makes up about one-fourth. Dycom also performs construction, engineering and maintenance services for electric and gas utilities and other customers.Dycom competes with Mastec (MTZ), Emcor Group (EME) and many small, local specialty contractors. But Dycom is a more specialized contractor than bigger Mastec.""Dycom sticks to what they know best, which is telecom networks,"" BB&T's Thalhimer said.

361,CHTR,"With Netflix (NFLX) posting a big miss on subscriber additions for the second quarter, pay TV proponents may be breathing a sigh of relief. And as the video streaming service's stock crumbles, two cable giants -- Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) -- are showing compelling chart action ahead of their quarterly reports.UBS said Tuesday that its recent survey showed that satisfaction with most aspects of the pay TV ""big bundle"" remain high, including customer experience, channel choice and customer service.But it's still good to keep in mind that one of the biggest reasons consumers cut the cord -- monthly cost -- received the lowest score out of all the metrics, with only 44% of those in the pay TV survey saying they were very or somewhat satisfied. And while cord-cutting fears have eased since the middle of last year, the analyst notes that those fears remain an ""overhang"" in the long term.UBS believes cable companies Comcast and Charter are best positioned as content migrates to nontraditional screens, saying cable provides the fastest in-home connections as well as in-home and out-of-home Wi-Fi.Comcast rose 0.3% to 67.09 Tuesday. The stock recently broke out to new highs after consolidating for a year. Shares are still trading in buy range past an entry at 65.09, and are just 1% below their July 12 high. Comcast reports quarterly earnings on July 27.IBD'S TAKE: Comcast is ranked No. 2 in the Telecom Services-Cable/Satellite industry group with a Composite Rating of 84 out of 99. But we can see using IBD Stock Checkup tool that the group is a laggard at No. 153 of the 197 groups that IBD tracks, and top stocks typically come out of the top quartile of IBD's groups. To find highly rated stocks from the best industry groups, check out Leaderboard.Charter is trading 3% below its recent high, reached after the stock broke out of a flat base with a 233.80 buy point. Shares struggled to hold within buy range Tuesday, losing 1%, but trading volume was light. Charter will issue its quarterly report on Aug. 9.Industry peers Verizon (VZ) and T-Mobile (TMUS) are trying to take advantage of the cord-cutting trend.Verizon has a mobile streaming service called Go90, which includes original series and sports. And T-Mobile allows its customers to stream unlimited video from YouTube Netflix, HBO and others for free with Binge On.Verizon is still trading in buy range after breaking out of a cup base in late June. It's just 2% below its recent peak, losing 0.4% Tuesday.T-Mobile is also near highs, gaining a fraction Tuesday, and is trading back in buy range from a long consolidation after testing support at its 50-day moving average.Meanwhile, Netflix gapped down 13% in heavy volume on its results, hitting a more than 5-month low in intraday trade. The move has Netflix undercutting its 50-day line, which is a key area of support for a stock. Shares are now trading 35% below their December high.

362,CHTR,"Stellar Q2 earnings results at T-Mobile US (TMUS) and its marketing momentum make it less likely the Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY)-controlled firm will be acquired soon, says one analyst.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, shot down speculation that T-Mobile will be acquired by Sprint (S), Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR), America Movil (AMX) or anyone else.Comcast, which like T-Mobile posted Q2 earnings early Wednesday, as usual fielded questions about its wireless strategy, noted Moffett.""At some point, investors will stop asking when and start asking why T-Mobile and parent Deutsche Telekom would want to sell, at least until the full value of the franchise T-Mobile has built has been recognized in its share price,"" said Moffett in a research report.Federal regulators blocked AT&T's (T) acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011. They've also signaled opposition to any merger between Sprint and T-Mobile.T-Mobile stock gained 1.5% to 45.64 on the stock market today. Earlier shares touched 45.87, hitting a nine-year high for the third day in the past four trading days. T-Mobile stock has a Relative Strength Rating of 81, putting it among the top 19% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock has gained 15% in 2016 but shares have met resistance at around 45 for 18 months. Learn more at IBM Stock Checkup. Big telecom mergers are off the table until government auction of airwaves used by TV station is over.With its Uncarrier-branded marketing campaign, T-Mobile has been gaining market share since 2014.T-Mobile on Wednesday said Q2 revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion as it added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers -- topping the 173,000 added by Sprint (S) and the 86,000 added by Verizon Communications (VZ). AT&T lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers.T-Mobile EPS fell 40% to 25 cents but still topped expectations for 22 cent profit. Higher borrowing costs ate into T-Mobile profit. It has added debt to fund bidding in the ongoing airwave auction, which started in March. It's uncertain when the auction will end.Sprint stock fell 7.4% on Wednesday, giving up some of the prior two days' gains following that telecom's earnings. Verizon rose 0.9% to 55.32.
"
363,CHTR,"Comcast's (CMCSA) broadband prowess makes it a top pick of Morgan Stanley, which also raised its price targets on AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).AT&T and Verizon stocks have jumped in 2016 amid growing investor demand for high-dividend-paying stocks as global interest rates fall.Morgan Stanley recently lowered its estimate for the 10-year Treasury rate to 1.25% by year-end 2016 and 1.10% by Q2, 2017. On Monday, Morgan Stanley hiked its PT on AT&T to 45 from 35 and on Verizon to 59 from 50, but noted that Comcast has an edge over telecommunication giants.""Comcast remains a top pick,"" Simon Flannery, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a report. ""On broadband, Comcast has taken around 45% to 50% of industry net adds since 2014, and we expect share gains to continue given its current and expected future speed advantage over telco competitors.""AT&T stock edged down 4 cents to 42.85 on the stock market today, while Verizon inched up 0.2% to 55.93 at the close.. Comcast stock, which recently hit an all-time high, ticked 2 cents higher to 66.86.IBD's TAKE: Shares in real estate investment trusts (REITs) have also done well in the low-rate environment. Check out the IBD 50 for REIT stocks.Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley cut its rating on CenturyLink (CTL) to underweight from hold and on Frontier Communications (FTR) to equal-weight from buy, partly owing to their geographic overlap with cable TV firms Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR).Flannery says CenturyLink and Frontier may need to increase capital spending to be more competitive.Flannery upped his Windstream (WIN) PT to 9 from 7. He increased Cincinnati Bell's (CBB) PT to 5 from 3.70.
"
364,CHTR,"Cable TV and phone companies have taken a regulatory spanking from the Obama administration. Will federal regulators ease up under the next U.S. president?The Federal Communications Commission won a big court victory in June on net neutrality rules governing broadband networks. Led by Chairman Tom Wheeler, the FCC has proposed new rules on consumer privacy and video competition that are opposed by AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA), Verizon Communications (VZ) and other telecoms, but which are supported by President Obama.If Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee for president, wins in November, more regulations might be on tap for AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and all internet services providers, analysts say. Republican front-runner Donald Trump's views on telecom policy and mergers are a bit of a mystery, though Republicans normally favor a lighter regulatory touch.""The current regulatory regime is viewed as openly anti-cable, so at this point investors may believe that any change at all can only be good news,"" Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, told IBD.How soon Wheeler leaves the FCC after the new president is elected is open to debate. Traditionally, the FCC chairman resigns shortly after a new administration takes over. Wheeler, though, has kept his options open, and his term doesn't end until 2018.""If Hillary Clinton wins the election, there is a possibility that she asks Wheeler to stay on until she can find a suitable replacement,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said in a report. ""But we do not expect it would be a long process.""We also believe there would be not much change to the status quo if Hillary is president.""President Obama has been outspoken on broadband issues in his second term. In November 2014, he pressured the FCC to impose public utility-type regulation on internet services, citing the Communications Act of 1934's Title II rules. Wheeler proposed the new net neutrality rules along those lines.The rules bar ISPs from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. Wheeler also extended the rules to include wireless networks for the first time.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in June upheld Wheeler's Title-II based rules, but AT&T quickly vowed to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. No appeal has yet been filed.The Obama administration has pushed to make broadband services more affordable for lower-income households, approving deals such as Charter Communications' (CHTR) purchase of Time Warner Cable, completed in May.For Comcast and other ISPs, though, probably the greatest potential danger is broadband price regulation. Wheeler has promised not to regulate prices for internet service, but a future FCC could possibly do so under Title II authority.While it may mean nothing, President Bill Clinton's first FCC chairman, Reed Hundt, rolled back cable TV prices in 1994. During the Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton talked tough on broadband regulation, likely not wanting rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to seize this issue.Cable stocks fell in October when Clinton wrote that U.S. ""prices for high-speed broadband are far higher"" than in some other countries, though she did not mention price regulation.""Clinton is widely viewed as more moderate than President Obama, but she has already singled out broadband in policy statements as something like a public utility,"" said Moffett.The FCC, meanwhile, is moving ahead with a proposal to require that internet service providers get customer consent to collect data for targeted advertising -- a policy that AT&T says would put it at a disadvantage vs. internet companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google or Facebook (FB), which do collect data on their users that helps target ads.In another move, the FCC aims to open up the TV set-top box market for more competition. The proposal would require pay-TV and tech companies to jointly develop new standards for devices providing access to cable TV programming. Potential set-top suppliers such as Apple (AAPL), Google or Amazon.com (AMZN) likely would provide their own programming guide and perhaps their own advertising to consumers, analysts say.Hillary Clinton's telecom policy would look like ""a third Obama term ... with the same implications in terms of corporate winners and losers,"" Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, said in a May research report.The presumed Democratic presidential candidate on Wednesday released what she called her initiative on technology and innovation. It had five main parts, with one of them a vow to assure that every U.S. household is hooked up to high-speed broadband, and that free Wi-Fi is available at public ""anchor"" institutions, such as airports.Trump, as president, would be a wild card, says Paul de Sa, an analyst at Bernstein Research.""A Democratic administration would build on the Obama achievements with a continued focus on competition, broadband and spectrum,"" de Sa told IBD via email. ""Under Trump, there's no idea how important media/telecom will be compared to other priorities or policy direction.""Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Securities, agrees. ""(Trump) would introduce a level of unpredictability that would be harder for investors to handicap than Clinton,"" she said in a research report.Trump has criticized many media outlets, claiming their news coverage of his campaign has been unfair. Comcast's NBCUniversal and Trump cut ties in late June 2015. NBCU said it would no longer broadcast the ""Miss USA"" and ""Miss Universe"" pageants, which are produced by Trump, because of his views on immigrants. Trump did not star in a new season of NBCU's ""The Apprentice"" in the fall of 2015, though he did appear on the network's ""Saturday Night Live,"" as did Clinton.Comcast's top lobbyist, David Cohen, has been a fundraiser for Obama and Clinton, according to media reports. Federal antitrust regulators in 2015 thwarted Comcast's proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable.AT&T's top lobbyist, Jim Cicconi, has also come out for Clinton, the Wall Street Journal reported recently reported, though he's a longtime Republican who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.Some analysts have speculated that Trump might be open to mergers that create new U.S. champions in telecom or other industries, but Moffett says that's unclear.""Trump is a complete wild card on just about every issue, so why should telecom be any different?"" Moffett said. ""Perhaps he will be pro-business, perhaps not. Would he view mergers favorably or unfavorably? What if one or both of the companies were foreign-owned, or if part of the rationale were to extract synergies that might move jobs offshore? The truth is, nobody has any idea.""AT&T shares rose 0.6% on the stock market today, hitting yet another all-time high. Verizon stock climbed 0.7%, also a new high, but still in buying range. Comcast edged up 0.1% while Charter Communications advanced 1.6%.
"
365,CHTR,"Cable TV companies will continue to dominate the consumer broadband market -- a trend which AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) can buck with wireless services, but which leaves smaller CenturyLink (CTL) and Frontier Communications (FTR) vulnerable, says Macquarie Securities.Amy Yong, a Macquarie analyst, initiated coverage Monday on CenturyLink with a neutral rating. Yong started Frontier, which earlier this year acquired residential landline assets in three states from Verizon, with an underperform rating.Shares of Comcast (CMCSA), the biggest cable TV firm, hit an all-time high of 67.69 early Monday, closing up 0.4% to 67.41 in the stock market today.Both CenturyLink and Frontier will be pressured as Comcast and Charter Communications (CHTR) continue to boost broadband speeds, says Macquarie's Yong.""By the end of the decade, we estimate 65% of broadband share will be in the hands of cable, up from 59% currently,"" Yong said in a research report. ""CenturyLink and Frontier are the most susceptible to cable competition, convergence of wireline/wireless, and the potential threat of wireless substitution.""IBD's Telecom Services-Integrated group ranks No. 31 out of 197 industry groups. AT&T leads with an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99, while Verizon sports a CR of 94.Shares of AT&T and Verizon have jumped amid growing investor demand for high-dividend-paying stocks as global interest rates sag.CenturyLink stock also has gained this year, up 20%, but Frontier stock is near even. CenturyLink rose 0.4% on Monday, but Frontier stock was down 1%.CenturyLink, like Verizon, is mulling a sale of its data centers amid fierce competition with Amazon Web Services, part of e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).""(CenturyLink's) dividend support is solid but unlikely to grow, pending strategic review of data centers,"" added Yong.

368,CHTR,"Cable TV companies and media stocks sold off on renewed worries that pay TV cord-cutting is accelerating after AT&T (T) preannounced Q3 financial numbers, including the loss of 90,000 video subscribers.X""We believe cord-cutting continues to gain steam as streaming builds momentum,"" said UBS analyst John Hodulik in a report. He estimated that the pay TV industry will lose about 1 million subscribers in the third quarter compared with 325,000 in the same quarter last year, based on recent management commentary.AT&T plunged 6.1% to close at 35.86 on the stock market today. AT&T also blamed recent hurricanes for video subscriber losses. Comcast (CMCSA), which in early September warned of video subscriber losses, shed 3.3% to 36.19.Comcast had attributed some of its video subscriber weakness to aggressive promotions launched by AT&T's landline ""U-verse""-branded TV service. Analysts say AT&T's DirecTV satellite TV service likely suffered the bulk of its subscriber losses in the third quarter.Shares in satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) fell 5.1% to 49.03 on Thursday. While AT&T bought DirecTV for $49 billion in 2016, analysts say Dish has had trouble finding a suitor amid continued subscriber losses.Both AT&T and Dish have launched internet video services. AT&T said it added 300,000 online DirecTV Now subscribers in the third quarter, offsetting some of the traditional pay TV losses. However, both AT&T and Dish garner less profit from internet services than traditional pay TV, analysts say.While AT&T is losing a net 90,000 video subscribers, it's traditional pay TV customer losses in third quarter are higher — 390,000 — partially offset by the addition of 300,000 internet video subscribers.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.UBS estimates that Dish's Sling service has 1.8 million subscribers and DirecTV Now 760,000.

369,CHTR,"Walt Disney (DIS) might try to play hardball in talks with Netherlands-based Altice Group, a newcomer to the U.S. cable TV industry, analysts said Monday.XAltice entered the U.S. market after purchasing Cablevision Systems in 2016 and Suddenlink in 2015. Its U.S. operations, Altice USA (ATUS), is the fourth-biggest U.S. cable TV company, behind Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and Atlanta-based Cox Communications.""Driven by accelerating subscriber losses we would not be surprised if Disney is being ultra-aggressive in its ongoing negotiations with Altice for renewal of carriage of (broadcaster) ABC, ESPN and the rest of its cable networks,"" said Jeffrey Wlodarczak, analyst at Pivotal Research, said in a note to clients.Neither Altice or Disney has disclosed ongoing negotiations for renewing a programming deal. Altice's U.S. shares fell 2.1% to close at 26.72 while Disney dipped 0.4% to 98.10.Richard Greenfield, analyst at BTIG Research has a similar view. He notes that Disney's sports network ESPN draws the highest fees from pay-TV companies but its viewership has been falling.""Unfortunately for Disney, their legacy practice of strong-arming distributors is no longer going to work,"" Greenfield said in a blog post. ""We believe this is especially true with a distributor that is taking a fresh look at the price/value of all programming as it has just recently entered the U.S. market. ESPN/ESPN2 are no longer worth the $7 to $8 per subscriber that they are paid by distributors.""IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Time Warner Cable and CBS (CBS) in 2013 had a brutal battle over fees.

387,CHTR,"Discovery Communications (DISCA) agreed to buy Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI) for $11.9 billion in a bet that uniting ownership of cable channels like Animal Planet and HGTV will help the company adapt to the changing television landscape.Discovery, one of billionaire John Malone's key holdings, will acquire Scripps for about $90 a share and assume long-term debt of $2.7 billion, bringing the total price of the equity value plus liabilities to $14.6 billion, according to a statement Monday. The price represents a 34% premium over Scripps' closing price of $67.02 on July 18, the day before news of the companies' talks became known.Discovery, based in Silver Spring, Maryland, is grappling with shrinking audiences at some U.S. channels — including the Discovery channel and Animal Planet — as consumers drop cable subscriptions and get more entertainment online from Netflix (NFLX) and others. The deal combines two companies that specialize in so-called unscripted programming, focused on real-life adventures, travel, wildlife and home. With Scripps, Discovery gets the home-improvement channel HGTV, where hits like ""Property Brothers"" and ""Fixer Upper"" have made it one of the more popular cable networks.The combined company will have almost 20% of the ad-supported pay-TV viewership in the U.S., according to the statement. Buying Scripps could also help Discovery boost its international sales, which currently account for half of its annual revenue. Knoxville, Tennessee-based Scripps owns an interest in Polish TV operator TVN and is expanding HGTV to new countries.""This agreement with Discovery presents an unmatched opportunity for Scripps to grow its leading lifestyle brands across the world and on new and emerging channels including short-form, direct-to-consumer and streaming platforms,"" Scripps Chief Executive Officer Kenneth W. Lowe said in the statement.Discovery's offer had forced Viacom (VIAB) to abandon its own efforts to acquire Scripps, people with direct knowledge of the matter said last week.Scripps rose 1.25% to 88 before the opening bell in the stock market today. Discovery Communications dipped 0.4% to 26.69.After being left out of some new online TV packages in the U.S., Discovery has been looking to create a low-cost web-only TV service with its cable channels and those of others for consumers who don't want to pay for sports, people with knowledge of the matter said in April. Neither Discovery or Scripps broadcasts live sports in the U.S.Though smaller, Scripps has an especially valuable asset in HGTV, which was the fourth-most watched U.S. network in prime time this year, with an average of 1.51 million viewers a night through July 16, according to Nielsen data. Parties to the Scripps Family Agreement control 92% of the voting stock.Deal talk is picking up in the TV industry as network owners grapple with the decline in cable and satellite services amid online competition. Liberty Media's Malone also has discussed a deal to buy all or part of Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Holdings, according to people familiar with the matter.Pay-TV distributors like Charter Communications (CHTR) and AT&T (T) have grown through acquisitions in recent years, giving them added leverage in fee negotiations with channel owners like Viacom, Discovery and Scripps. That's led some network owners to conclude they need to sell as well. Time Warner (TWX), owner of TNT and HBO, agreed last year to be bought by AT&T (T) for $85.4 billion.Cable and satellite-TV providers pay fees to channel owners for the right to carry their channels, and the negotiations have grown more tense now that more pay-TV subscribers are cutting the cord.Network owners are also beginning to offer their own online services to compete with Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned YouTube and Netflix. CBS (CBS) offers its flagship network and Showtime as standalone services online. Walt Disney (DIS), which owns ESPN, is developing an online service to reach sports fans who aren't using traditional cable.RELATED:Is Softbank Eyeing Charter Bid, Shotgun Marriage For Sprint?

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December. The real uncertainty, hinging on the inflation outlook, is what Fed policy will look like in 2018.A flurry of chip-industry players posted beat-and-raise June-quarter results including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN), as well as chip-gear suppliers Lam Research (LRCX) and Teradyne (TER).AMD earned an adjusted 2 cents a share on sales of $1.22 billion in Q2, when analysts expected it to break even on sales $1.16 billion.

Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed.

The investment bank said it looked for quality names that ""may have been caught up in the sell-off despite limited exposure to the macro effects.""The tech stocks selected by Morgan Stanley included Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Charter Communications (CHTR), Facebook (FB), IBM (IBM), Level 3 Communications (LVLT), Proofpoint (PFPT), T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS) and Workiva (WK).""For each of these names, we believe the post-vote weakness creates an opportunity to add to positions,"" Morgan Stanley said.Investment bank Jefferies said in a research report Monday that there are U.S. stock-buying opportunities amid ""the wreckage"" of the Brexit sell-off.Jefferies polled its analysts for ""stocks where they believe the recent sell-off may be too punitive — presenting medium- and long-term opportunity.""Jefferies chose 27 stocks that its analysts believe offer trading opportunities from the recent sell-off.Tech stocks selected by Jefferies included Mimecast (MIME), Priceline Group (PCLN) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Priceline and other online travel stocks, though, got hammered Friday on the Brexit fallout, since they do a lot of business in the U.K. and Europe.

391,CHTR,"Netflix (NFLX) could sway Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) into making a Netflix app available on set-top boxes by cutting a deal similar to what it has with Apple (AAPL), says Morgan Stanley.Apple garners a 30% commission on any digital purchases made from apps listed in its iOS app store. Netflix last year enabled in-app subscriptions for iOS users for the first time.“We think Charter, and perhaps even Comcast, could move to integrate Netflix into their video offerings,” Benjamin Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst, wrote in a research report.He said there’s upside for Netflix if it can add “older demographics,” which he called a “key area where it remains under-penetrated.”While Comcast and Charter have been holdouts, Swinburne pointed out that Dish Network (DISH), Suddenlink, Cablevision Systems (CVC) and Verizon Communications (VZ) offer Netflix or Hulu apps.“We would expect Netflix to give up some economics, similar to other distribution partners like Apple or TiVo (TIVO), but we do not believe it would meaningfully alter the direction of Netflix profits over time,” Swinburne said. “Payments to distribution partners are reported in marketing expenses on Netflix's consolidated financials.”The Morgan Stanley analyst, though, says the cable TV firms might see a reduction in pay-per-view movie revenue if they integrate Netflix content into set-top boxes.Netflix stock, down about 12% in 2016, closed up 1.15% in the stock market today. Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating on the stock.Shares of Comcast and Charter lost 0.2% and 1.45%, respectively on Monday.

393,CHTR,"Now that John Malone’s Charter Communications (CHTR) has closed its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, analysts are focused on how much cash the new cable TV industry powerhouse will generate to boost shares.Bryan Kraft, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, says Charter could repurchase up to $5 billion in shares as soon as next year, on gains in its free cash flow — cash from operations minus capital expenditures, a key financial metric. But this estimate assumes the now No. 2 U.S. cable company will pause for breath after making its big acquisitions.“I would caveat this in saying that if Charter has other, more attractive opportunities to invest capital in growing its business either organically or through an acquisition, those opportunities would take priority,” Kraft told IBD.Charter could continue acquiring smaller cable TV companies, or even not-so-small Cox Communications, observers say. Charter might even team with Comcast (CMCSA) to acquire wireless firm T-Mobile US (TMUS), Jeffrey Wlodarczak, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, told IBD.Wlodarczak, though, is among analysts that say Charter stock repurchases are in the cards, in any case.""Malone is all about massive share repurchase activity and M&A where it is attractive,"" said Wlodarczak, noting that Liberty Global (LBTYA) and some other Malone-controlled companies have buybacks underway. In its Q1 earnings report May 9, Liberty Global said it plans to repurchase $3.7 billion of its shares by the end of 2017.JPMorgan credit analyst Michael Pace, in a recent research report, also speculates that the new Charter will buy back shares -- if acquisitions don't get in the way. “We expect the company to begin a stock repurchase program in the 2017 time frame, assuming no meaningful M&A opportunities arise,” Pace wrote.Former TWC shareholders own about 45% of the new Charter. Only 1% of TWC shareholders opted to take Charter’s higher cash offer when the deal closed, choosing instead to own more Charter stock.From 2010 through Q1 2016, TWC spent $20.7 billion repurchasing its own stock, says Howard Silverblatt, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. That includes $1.32 billion in Q1. Charter bought back 12.7% of its stock in 2011, but that was before Malone took a big stake in the cable TV firm in early 2013.Malone founded U.S. cable firm Tele-Communications Inc. in the 1970s and convinced Wall Street to value high-capital-spending, debt-laden companies based on free cash flow rather than earnings. He sold TCI to AT&T (T) in 1998 for $52 billion.Charter’s $58 billion purchase of TWC closed on May 18, putting Malone back in the cable TV industry spotlight. Charter has morphed into the No. 2 cable TV firm, behind Comcast (CMCSA). Charter has about 21 million Internet customers and 17.5 million video customers. Charters rivals also include telecom leaders Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T).Malone’s Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) owns about 18% of the new Charter and has 25% of the voting power. Media company Advance/Newhouse has a 13% stake in the new company.Besides TWC, Charter also acquired Bright House, for $11 billion. Charter has about $57 billion in debt on its books, a mix of investment grade and high yield, including about $21 billion of debt assumed from TWC.Fitch Ratings estimates Charter will churn out $4 billion of pro-forma free cash flow in 2016 and 2017. Moody’s Investor Service’s estimate is $2.5 billion “going forward.”Standard & Poor’s says it expects Charter to pay “minimal cash taxes until 2019.” How so? Charter, which exited bankruptcy in 2009, holds some $3 billion in net operating losses as well as other federal tax credits that it plans to use to offset future taxes owed. That’ll boost free cash flow, analysts say.The tax savings might last through 2020, says Morgan Stanley.A big question is whether Charter, described in 2013 by Malone as a “horizontal acquisition machine,” will keep shopping. Analysts say that asset swaps are possible among Comcast, Charter and Europe-based Altice Group, which is buying two U.S. cable companies, SuddenLink and Cablevision Systems (CVC). Approval of the Cablevision deal is pending, while SuddenLink closed near year-end.Charter CEO Tom Rutledge, in a Bloomberg interview, said he’s focused on integrating New York-based TWC and Syracuse, N.Y.-based Bright House into the company. “I think we’ll take a breather,” Rutledge said on possible M&As. “We’ve just gone through two years of transactions and regulatory approval. We don’t have any new transactions in mind.”A lack of M&As would hike chances of stock buybacks.UBS, in a March report, speculated that if Charter keeps its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) at around four times debt, it’ll eventually be in a position to “fund the repurchase” of one-third of its stock float.Malone’s TCI and current Liberty group of companies has used free cash flow and debt to make acquisitions. Malone’s Liberty Global (LBTYA) is the biggest cable TV firm worldwide, with 24 million video subscribers in Europe and Latin America, where U.S. leader Comcast ended Q1 with 22.4 million cable TV subscribers.If Charter puts M&A on the back-burner, some analysts say Malone could consolidate some of his media assets or acquire more. Malone holds stakes in Discovery (DISCA), Starz, QVC Group and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF). Federal regulators did not place any Malone-related conditions involving content providers on Charter's TWC acquisition.Charter, meanwhile, aims to lower the programming fees it pays to companies such as Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA). Those fees will amount to about $9 billion pro-forma in 2016, said Rutledge. With more subscribers, the new Charter should be able to hammer out better deals with content providers.Charter faces a decision on what to do with TWC's legacy sports networks, especially the channel carrying Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games. Other pay-TV providers have not carried the channel, in a long-running dispute.

394,CHTR,"A U.S. federal appeals court handed the Obama administration and Federal Communications Commission a victory Tuesday, upholding net neutrality rules that include wireless networks and that were opposed by the nation’s biggest providers of broadband services but supported by Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX).The ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit could be sent to the U.S. Supreme Court, as AT&T (T) quickly vowed to appeal the decision.“We have always expected this issue to be decided by the Supreme Court, and we look forward to participating in that appeal,"" David McAfee, AT&T general counsel, said in a statement shortly after the appeals court ruling.Shares of internet service providers Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T rose a fraction in the stock market today, despite the ruling. Charter Communications (CHTR)  fell a fraction. The ISPs oppose the FCC’s Open Internet Order, claiming it will impact investment and threaten innovation.Meanwhile, Alphabet and Netflix shares both rose a fraction Tuesday.Two of the appeals court judges -- David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan -- ruled in favor of the FCC, while Judge Stephen Williams was opposed. Analysts had expected the split 2-1 ruling, as occurred in two earlier cases where Comcast and Verizon challenged the FCC’s authority to impose net neutrality rules.Verizon had won the most recent case, in 2014.The new rules bar ISPs from throttling, blocking or prioritizing web traffic. The FCC also created a general conduct standard that ISPs cannot harm consumers or ""service edge"" providers, such as Alphabet's Google or Netflix.“Today’s ruling is a victory for consumers and innovators who deserve unfettered access to the entire web, and it ensures the internet remains a platform for unparalleled innovation, free expression and economic growth. After a decade of debate and legal battles, today’s ruling affirms the commission’s ability to enforce the strongest possible internet protections -- both on fixed and mobile networks -- that will ensure the internet remains open, now and in the future,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement.The FCC in February 2015 reclassified broadband services as a public utility in order to enforce net neutrality rules under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act. The agency also expanded net neutrality rules to wireless networks for the first time.A cable trade group also hinted at a likely appeal.“We are reviewing today’s split decision by the D.C. circuit panel and will carefully review the majority and dissenting opinions before determining next steps,"" the NCTA, the main U.S. cable industry trade group, said in an emailed statement. ""Though disappointed in today’s result, we are particularly gratified by Judge Williams’ recognition of the ‘watery thin and self-contradictory’ nature of the FCC arguments used to justify the imposition of common carriage laws on internet networks.""While this is unlikely the last step in this decade-long debate over internet regulation, we urge bipartisan leaders in Congress to renew their efforts to craft meaningful legislation that can end ongoing uncertainty, promote network investment and protect consumers.”

396,CHTR,"Stocks wiped away most gains Wednesday afternoon after Federal Reserve policymakers said they would likely raise interest rates in June if incoming data showed the economy picking up.The Nasdaq was holding onto a 0.4% gain, but the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 erased early gains in the stock market today. Volume on the Nasdaq was little changed from Tuesday’s levels. NYSE volume was unavailable.""Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,"" according to minutes from the Fed's April meeting.Statements from Fed governors and bullish economic reports, including a recent uptick in consumer prices and better-than-expected housing data, have fueled sentiment that the central bank will raise interest rates as early as June.Telecommunications stocks were among the day’s biggest gainers, led by Charter Communications (CHTR), which popped 10% to a new high after announcing Wednesday that it had completed its acquisition of Time Warner Cable.Meanwhile, building products retailer Lowe’s (LOW) jumped 4% to a new high, clearing a 77.73 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in heavy volume after a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.The results came a day after a better-than-expected earnings report from rival Home Depot (HD), which continued lower Wednesday for a second straight day.In the IBD 50, chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) rose nearly 3% to a new high, as the stock continues to climb following its blowout quarterly earnings report last week.

398,CHTR,"Charter Communications (CHTR) stock fell Monday after the soon-to-be No. 2 cable TV firm was not added to the S&P 500, as some analysts and investors had expected, following the final approval of its Time Warner Cable acquisition.Standard & Poor’s announced late Friday that Digital Realty (DLR), a data center operator whose stock has been rising of late, would replace Time Warner Cable in the S&P 500.Digital Realty will take TWC 's place on the index after the close of trading on Tuesday. Charter expects to close its purchases of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks on Wednesday, after gaining the final regulator OK on Thursday. It will then become the No. 2 cable company, behind Comcast (CMCSA).Equinix (EQIX) early Monday announced that it will sell eight European data centers to Digital Realty for $874 million. Regulators required Equinix to divest some assets in approving its acquisition of Telecity. The eight data centers consist of five in London, two in Amsterdam and one in Frankfurt.Shares of Digital Realty, which announced an equity offering to fund the Equinix deal, were up 2.5% early Monday, near 96 and touching an all-time high for the sixth day in the past eight trading days. Digital Realty stock is up 25% this year. Equinix stock was up a fraction early Monday.Charter stock was down nearly 4% in early trading in the stock market today, near 206.California regulators last week approved the Time Warner Cable (TWC) deal, the final hurdle to Charter’s makeover.Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) will own about 18% of the new Charter, while privately held media firm Advance/Newhouse will own about 13.5%.
"
399,CHTR,"Federal regulators opted to place no conditions related to John Malone’s sprawling media and telecom holdings in approving Charter Communication’s (CHTR) acquisitions of Time Warner Cable (TWC) (IBD) and Bright House Networks.California regulators are expected to approve Charter’s deals as soon as Thursday, the final hurdle to Charter’s makeover. Charter will leap to No. 2 in the cable TV industry, behind Comcast (CMCSA).Comcast owns NBCUniversal and NBCU-related conditions that the FCC imposed on Comcast in 2011, which are set to expire in 2018. NBCU's assets include the broadcast TV network, cable channels and a movie studio.Consumer group Public Knowledge, the American Cable Association and others asked the FCC to look into Malone’s holdings as part of the Charter review. Dish Network (DISH) waged the biggest fight against the TWC deal, while Netflix (NFLX) stayed on the sidelines.Malone controls Liberty Broadband (LBDRA), which will own about 18% of the new Charter and has rights to name three board members. Privately held media firm Advance/Newhouse will own about 13.5% of Charter. Liberty Broadband stock touched a record high for the second straight day on Wednesday.Malone holds a 28.7% voting interest in Discovery (DISCA); a 31.8% voting interest in Starz (STRZA); a 37.7% voting interest in the QVC Group, and a 3.3% voting interest in Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF), which holds a stake in Epix, according to the FCC.While much of Malone’s media holdings will now constitute Charter’s “affiliated programming,”  the FCC says it already has rules in place to govern those companies' relationships with other pay-TV providers.“Because New Charter will lack the incentive or ability to withhold or raise prices of affiliated programming, we further find it unnecessary to extend or modify our program access rules or impose other conditions on the licensing of New Charter’s affiliated content,” the FCC said in its May 6 order approving Charter’s acquisitions.The FCC’s conditions on Charter’s acquisitions aim to protect competition from Internet video providers such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.com (AMZN).Charter will not be allowed to charge data usage-based prices or impose data caps on broadband customers for seven years. Those conditions could impact Comcast if it makes more acquisitions.Some analysts have speculated that Malone could consolidate some of his media assets and/or acquire more.Malone also controls Liberty Global, a Europe-based telecom company.""Malone's ownership of distribution and content assets globally implicitly has a scale larger than even Comcast, but with a much more fragmented ownership structure and working relationships,"" said a Barclays report in January.
"
400,CHTR,"The Justice Department approved the Charter Communications (CHTR) takeover of Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks after the cable giants agreed to concessions that should benefit Netflix (NFLX) and other streaming media.Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler also backed the deal. The FCC will likely approve the combination soon. After that, California regulators would pose the final hurdle for the merger. They are expected to approve it in a vote next month.As part of the deal, Charter will expand the number of homes with broadband access by 2 million, including 1 million with another high-speed provider, Wheeler said.Netflix has endorsed the deal, based on Charter's pledges. Charter agreed to not impose data caps or tie Internet rates to usage. Charter also won't be allowed to sign deals with content providers to make it harder for Netflix and other streaming services to get content.Charter said last year it would have some 23.9 million cable and broadband customers in 41 states, with big gains in Los Angeles and New York. It would be the No. 2 broadband operator after Comcast (CMSCA).Charter Communications in May 2015 agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $55.1 billion and Bright House for $10.4 billion. That followed the collapse of Comcast's planned Time Warner Cable buy due to regulatory objections.Charter Communications stock rose 4.6% to 207.01 on the stock market today, with Time Warner Cable climbed 4.1% to 209.83. Netflix fell 2.4% as shares still reel from last week's weak subscriber outlook. Comcast fell fractionally.Related:How Charter Broadband Conditions May Set Bar For Comcast

401,CHTR,"Comcast (CMCSA) is expected to report flat Q1 EPS with revenue rising 4%, though analysts expect a strong quarter in video subscriber additions.At NBCUniversal, analysts say ad revenue could be a bright spot at TV broadcasting, though film revenue will fall from the year-earlier quarter amid a weaker slate of movies. Theme parks might get a boost from late March school breaks tied to Easter.Comcast stock has risen 7.5% in 2016, despite regulatory headwinds. The nation’s No. 1 cable TV firm is slated to release Q1 earnings before the open Wednesday. Comcast holds an IBD Composite Rating of 74 out of a possible 99.Cable TV firms have been squabbling with the Federal Communications Commission over broadband privacy issues as well as the agency's plans to open up the set-top box market to more competition. Some analysts say there could be more scrutiny of broadband pricing and data caps depending on the outcome of the 2016 election.In Q1, rival Verizon Communications (VZ) said it would expand its FiOS broadband and TV services to Boston, a Comcast market, though its timing is unclear.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Comcast to report profit of 79 cents, even with the year-earlier period, which would be its worst showing in at least 19 quarters. Analysts estimate revenue will rise 4% to $18.64 billion, its smallest percentage rise in four quarters.Comcast stock was down a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 60.50.On Comcast’s earnings call, executives might discuss NBCU’s upcoming contract renewals with Dish Network (DISH) and Verizon Communications (VZ), and a programming dispute with 21st Century Fox’s (FOXA) (IBD) YES sports network.Charter Communications (CHTR)  will be the No. 2 cable TV firm if federal regulators approve its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks. Both Charter and TWC report earnings on Thursday.
"
402,CHTR,"Charter Communications (CHTR) will not be allowed  to charge data usage-based prices or impose data caps on broadband customers for seven years as part of proposed conditions set by federal regulators  for its acquisition of Time Warner Cable (TWC).Whatever conditions Charter agrees to might set the bar for Comcast (CMCSA) down the road, analysts say.The Department of Justice on Monday cleared Charter’s purchase of TWC, while the Federal Communications Commission moved closer to approval.  FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is circulating proposed conditions to the five-member agency.California regulators are expected to green light the purchase in mid-May.Charter snapped up TWC after regulators thwarted Comcast’s takeover of Time Warner Cable in early 2015. Conditions set on the Charter-TWC deal might have implications for Comcast if it seeks another major acquisition, such as acquiring T-Mobile US (TMUS) or Sprint (S).Comcast has filed to be a possible bidder in a government auction of radio spectrum owned by local TV stations. That auction began in late March.Comcast has been testing data caps in an increasing number of markets.“New Charter will not be permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps,” Wheeler said in a statement. “Second, New Charter will be prohibited from charging interconnection fees, including to online video providers, which deliver large volumes of internet traffic to broadband customers.”Video streamer Netflix did not oppose Charter’s purchase of TWC, but it had lobbied against the Comcast-TWC deal.Charter can’t strike agreements with programmers that would make it more difficult for streaming services like Netflix (NFLX) to obtain content, according to a DOJ filing in federal court.Charter has also agreed to buy privately held Bright House Networks. The two deals would make Charter the No. 2 cable TV firm behind Comcast.

403,CHTR,"Top brass at Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Pfizer (PFE), Comcast (CMCSA) and McKesson (MCK) headlined the week's insider transactions.Co-founder and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang on Thursday reported a sale executed Wednesday of 40,000 shares of his company's stock for $1.44 million.Late Thursday, Nvidia reported a 38% jump in earnings per share minus one-time items and a 14% hike in revenue to $1.31 billion. Both figures topped analysts consensus.Nvidia shares gapped up 15% Friday to an all-time high of 40.98, and ended the week up 16%.Executive Chairman David Aldrich, a 21-year Skyworks veteran, in a filing Thursday reported he had sold 15,000 shares for $964,940.Also on Thursday, Skyworks announced that Aldrich, who guided the company from 2002 when it was formed by the merger of two wireless technology companies, stepped down as CEO. Skyworks named Liam Griffin as the new chief.Skyworks shares lost 6% for the week.Chairman and CEO Ian Read sold 275,000 shares for $33.80 a share, or $9.295 million.Pfizer on May 3 beat Wall Street's Q1 estimates and raised its guidance. The company also called off last month its $160 billion merger with Allergan (AGN), after the Treasury unveiled new rules to curb tax inversion deals.Pfizer shares dipped 1.2% this week.Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts on Thursday filed for the sale of 200,000 Comcast shares for $62.65 a share, or a total $12.53 million.The largest cable provider will soon have a stronger No. 2 to contend with. Charter Communications (CHTR) recently received approval from the FCC and California regulators for its buyout of Time Warner Cable (TWC).Comcast shares edged up 0.7%.Chairman and CEO John Hammergren sold 101,833 shares at $170.71 a share, or $17.38 million total.Earlier this month, McKesson reported disappointing fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue. The company had earlier warned  weak generic drug prices and ""recent customer consolidation."" Rite Aid (RAD) agreed last year to be acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which has a distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen (ABC).McKesson fell 1.7% for the week.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider’s holdings, however, can affect a stock.

404,CHTR,"Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP) terminated their merger plans after a D.C. federal judge late Tuesday granted an FTC injunction to block the deal, dismissing arguments that Amazon.com (AMZN) and others would provide sufficient competition.Staples stock fell 20% on the stock market today, while Office Depot plunged 37%.Judge Emmet Sullivan said that the FTC had shown a ""reasonable probability"" that the merger would ""substantially impair competition"" for office supply sales to large business customers.Staples and Office Depot had argued that Amazon, Costco (COST), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others would provide sufficient competition. The FTC, which hailed the ruling, said Amazon and other sellers of office supplies did not have sufficient heft with big corporations.""We are extremely disappointed that the FTC’s request for preliminary injunction was granted despite the fact that it failed to define the relevant market correctly, and fell woefully short of proving its case,"" Staples CEO Ron Sargent said in a statement.Staples will pay a $250 million break-up fee to Office Depot.The Obama administration has become more aggressive in blocking mergers on antitrust grounds. In the past year or so, it's blocked a Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger -- though it recently blessed a Charter Communications (CHTR)-TWC tie-up. It's also stopped the General Electric (GE) appliance unit sale to Electrolux and the Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI) oil services combination. 
"
405,CHTR,"Federal regulators have been on a roll when it comes to blocking proposed megamergers.The Staples (SPLS)-Office Depot (ODP) deal is simply the latest casualty. The victims have come from all walks of corporate life, from oilfield services giants Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to cable television titans Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC).Several more big takeovers are threatened. Health insurance behemoths Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) are looking to recite corporate nuptials as are Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM), but already regulators are whispering their concerns. The  Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)-Rite Aid (RAD) deal also is in doubt.Is it politics, or happenstance? San Diego State University finance professor Nikhil Varaiya, an expert on M&A activity, cautions not to read too much into it even though there has been heightened scrutiny of mergers in the last year of the Obama administration. Varaiya agrees there's been more activity, but says it usually depends on the individual circumstances.""(It) could be because these companies are trying to merge in this time period,"" he said. ""Halliburton’s merger attempt, for example, reflected the lower demand for oil and their trying to reduce capacity. The concern by regulators might be that when the oil markets pick up, they might have a dominant company.""Halliburton and Baker Hughes called off their $28 billion merger on May 1, citing tough resistance from U.S. and European regulators. Still, Varaiya noted that future Justice Department actions on proposed mergers could hinge in part on who comes into power in the fall.""Any Democrat administration tends to be more concerned about concentration and competitiveness,"" Varaiya said. ""So it's likely they will bring more cases before a judge.""U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington late Tuesday agreed with Federal Trade Commission regulators that the pairing of Staples and Office Depot would violate antitrust laws and reduce competition.Shares of Staples gapped down 18% to 8.37 in the stock market Wednesday after the office supply giants announced they would no longer try to merge. Office Depot plunged 40% to 3.62.Roy Behren, partner and portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Funds in Valhalla, N.Y., said it would have been hard for Staples and Office Depot to satisfy the FTC.""In the case of Office Depot, which we have been monitoring carefully but declined to invest in because it involved creation of a monopoly, you essentially had the two main players in the market. That would create problematic market power,"" Behren said.But Behren doesn't rule out political influence in all cases.""We view that the Bush administration was much less inclined to prosecute what they perceived as antitrust or market concentration,"" he said. ""Obama administration regulators were aware in the case of Baker Hughes that Halliburton had agreed to divest $7 billion of revenue to get this done. That still didn’t get the job done.""Behren said the most scrutinized transaction at the moment is the Walgreens Boost Alliance deal to buy smaller drug store chain Rite Aid. Walgreens has agreed to divest stores to get the $17 billion deal done, but regulators are still scrutinizing it.""It’s possible that structural remedies could satisfy regulators,"" he said.Meanwhile, the list of failed mergers gets longer. General Electric's (GE) proposed sale of its appliance business to Sweden's Electrolux fell through in December after the Justice Department said the deal would unfairly reduce competition in that sector and asked a federal judge to block it. Last year's $3.5 billion bid by privately held US Foods for rival Sysco (SYY) was blocked on grounds that it would have created a food distribution behemoth.No. 1 cable company Comcast's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable was turned down in late August of last year after regulators threatened to issue a hearing designation that would have delayed its consideration for months or years.Instead, last Friday the FCC OK'd Charter Communications' (CHTR) offer for TWC, and Charter's separate purchase of Bright House Networks. The combined deals, valued at nearly $79 billion, will create the No. 2 cable TV and Internet provider, the FCC said.The DOJ also is eyeing health insurance consolidation.No. 3 U.S. insurer by revenue Aetna agreed to merge with Humana in a deal valued at $34 billion. But William Baer, assistant attorney general, said during a Senate subcommittee hearing last week that the proposed tie-up would be ""very, very carefully"" scrutinized.No. 2 insurer Anthem hammered out a deal with another major player, Cigna. But in a regulatory filing this month, Cigna said ""In light of the complexity of the regulatory process and dynamic environment, it is possible that such approvals may not be obtained in 2016.""Michael Shannon, another Westchester Capital managing partner and portfolio manager, said that with the national elections just months away some candidates are talking tough about regulating mergers.""In past elections, parties (running for office) would talk, saying we’re going to do this or do that. But regulators are under the law,"" Shannon said. ""At the end of the day, you can’t just rule as you want to.""

406,CHTR,"Cablevision Systems (CVC) stock jumped Friday on a report that New York City will not block its acquisition by Europe’s Altice Group.In New York, Altice would compete against Verizon Communications (VZ) and its FiOS services. Verizon said earlier this week it plans to expand FiOS services to Boston.Cablevision stock was up more than 2%, near 33.70, in morning trading in the stock market today, breaking out of a flat base at 33.45 buy point. Altice had been under scrutiny because of its debt. New York City, however, determined that former Mayor Michael Bloomberg gave away its authority in cable mergers to the state, the New York Post said in a report.Meanwhile, Charter Communications (CHTR) is awaiting the Federal Communications Commission’s approval for its acquisition of Time Warner Cable (TWC). An administrative law judge in California on Tuesday recommended that the Charter-TWC deal be approved with conditions, clearing a hurdle.The FCC thwarted Comcast’s (CMCSA) proposed purchase of TWC in early 2015.If both the Charter-TWC and Altice-Cablevision deals go through, cable TV firms are likely to explore asset swaps of cable systems in different markets, a Barclays analyst has speculated. Comcast could be involved, says Barclays.Charter also plans to buy privately held Bright House Networks. Altice in May acquired a 70% stake in Midwest-based Suddenlink Communications. Altice agreed to pay about $10 billion, or $34.90 per share, for Cablevision, including $3 billion in cash.

407,CHTR,"It was a busy week for business, economic and investing news. The stock market came under more pressure as Apple (AAPL) reported its first sales decline since 2003, while Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) turned on the gas. The Federal Reserve signaled it's in no rush to raise rates, while the U.S. economy crawls.The market rally came under more pressure amid a slew of earnings reports and big economic news. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.7% for the week, falling through its 200-day line on Thursday and its 50-day average on Friday, as losers such as Apple, Twitter (TWTR) and First Solar (FSLR) trumped big gains for Facebook and Amazon. The S&P 500 and Dow are well above those support levels, but also tumbled, with all of the losses coming Thursday-Friday. Oil prices continued to march higher, helped by a weaker dollar and further declines in U.S. production. The 10-year Treasury yield gave up much of its recent gains.How healthy are shares of Amazon and Facebook, and how do they compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupThe tech titan certainly wasn't a growth company in its fiscal second quarter, reporting its first revenue decline since 2003 as iPhone unit sales tumbled. Earnings per share fell 18%, worse than expected. And Apple gave weak guidance for the current quarter. Apple hasn't had a huge product since the big-screen iPhone 6, and smartphone sales generally are stagnating. At this point Apple is so huge it will be hard for a new product to really move the needle.In another sign of its shift from rapid growth to a more mature model, Apple added an additional $50 billion to its shareholder return program, with more buybacks and a higher dividend.Meanwhile, activist investor Carl Icahn decided to cash out of Apple stock, and so did others. Apple stock fell 11.3% for the week, nearly settling at its worst close since mid-2014.Apple chip suppliers generally fared relatively well, in part due to diversifying away from Apple or smartphones generally.Apple Investors Worry Glory Days Are OverThe Federal Reserve, as expected, voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting and gave no hints that it would tighten before the fall at the earliest. The Fed noted that labor markets have strengthened even as economic growth slowed. And that's true, for now. The U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter, the weakest in two years. Meanwhile, jobless claims are near 42-year lows. If the economy is barely growing, it's hard to see how the U.S. can continue to add 200,000 jobs a month. But that's what analysts are expecting in Friday's April employment report.The Fed's go-slow approach -- coupled with the Bank of Japan's unexpected decision not to increase its stimulus efforts -- pushed the dollar to big losses. That could boost U.S. multinationals' profits and give a further lift to dollar-priced oil and other commodities.The e-commerce giant sees Q2 sales of $28 billion-$30.5 billion, largely above Wall St. views and a 26% gain at the midpoint. While that would mark a slowdown from Q1's 28% pop, the highest in nearly 4 years, it would still be faster than what was typical the past three years. Q1 earnings also crushed estimates, as cloud unit Amazon Web Services remained hot. China's version of Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), reports Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Ford Motor (F), Uber, Lyft and Volvo announced Tuesday the formation of a coalition to advocate for self-driving cars. The lobbying effort comes as automakers race to develop autonomous technologies. Alphabet is in late-stage talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) about a partnership regarding autonomous cars, according to multiple reports. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) already has self-driving features in its electric cars, but has not unveiled plans to join the coalition. Tesla will report earnings on Wednesday, with autonomous tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) out Thursday.Social networking kings Facebook and LinkedIn had a good week, as both posted Q1 earnings that topped estimates and sent the stocks higher. Facebook reported its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings and revenue growth. Despite concerns about slowing user engagement, advertisers are definitely using Facebook. Mobile advertising accounted for 82% of Facebook's $5.2 billion in ad revenue, up from 73% in Q1 2015. Facebook stock spiked Thursday to a record high of 120.71, but pulled back to close the week modestly above a 117.09 buy point.LinkedIn renewed investor confidence after a harrowing Q4 that saw its stock plunge 44%. LinkedIn turned in a solid Q1 earnings that investors applauded.With the U.S. and global economy growing at a tepid pace, companies are stressing cost cuts to prop up earnings as revenue flatlines or falls. In the latest week, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, snack giant  Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) announced recent or new efforts to curb expenses, restructure or sell assets. They join the likes of Coca-Cola (KO)  and banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). While cuts may help companies in the short run, they need stronger top-line growth to fuel earnings longer term.Shifting priorities for media companies came into play last week, as a handful of megamergers captured the spotlight and served as an attempt to keep growing or simply cling to survival. Cable and content titan Comcast (CMCSA) sought to grow in foreign markets via a $3.8 billion deal to buy DreamWorks Animation (DWA), the studio responsible for ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda."" Meanwhile, it looks like Comcast rival Charter Communications (CHTR) will be able to keep up, as its $55 billion bid to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) won regulatory approval. But survival in the struggling newspaper industry was on the mind of USA Today parent Gannett (GCI) as it bid $815 million to buy Tribune Publishing (TPUB), owner of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.Crude oil futures continued to rise, hitting 2016 highs. But Big Oil is still adjusting to lower prices. Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its oil dependence and float less than 5% of Saudi Aramco in an IPO, valuing the world’s largest oil company in excess of $2 trillion Meanwhile,  ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its 2016 capital spending even further and BP (BP) said it was considering further cuts in '17.  Baker Hughes (BHI) warned that N. American rig counts still have room to fall, but the U.S. count may stabilize later this year. Chevron (CVX) swung to a loss in Q1.

Big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion cash bid for smaller drugmaker Medivation (MDVN). Medivation rejected Sanofi's offer, but Sanofi vowed to press on, and Medivation's stock traded as if investors are expecting Sanofi (and perhaps another bidder) to go higher. Both Stemcentrx and Medivation are focused on cancer treatments, a field that has provided some of the biggest drug launches of recent years.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) recovery might be slow-going, with April same-store sales down 26% to date, surprising many.

408,CHTR,"The Federal Communications Commission moved ahead on Thursday with a proposal to regulate prices in the $20 billion market for business data services, drawing criticism from AT&T (T) and cable TV rivals.The FCC rules would regulate new entrants in the market -- cable TV firms such as Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) -- as well as the biggest providers of  business data services, including AT&T, Verizon Communications (VZ) and local phone companies CenturyLink (CTL) and Frontier Communications (FTR).""The FCC is likely doing this as long-term insurance in case cable does eventually become dominant in any business markets,"" said Paul Gallant, analyst at Guggenheim Partners, in a report.The high-speed connections are used for retail outlets, ATM machines and cell towers. Smaller telecom firms such as Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Cogent Communications (CCOI) sometimes rent the ""special access"" lines to serve their customers. Some of these have complained over long-term contracts and termination fees.AT&T has lobbied against the new price regulation, while Verizon has been less opposed. Verizon plans to deploy 5G wireless services and may gain from lower prices for cell tower connections, analysts say.“Never before has the FCC sought to saddle new entrants with such heavy-handed pricing mandates -- in any arena, let alone the broadband marketplace, (FCC) Chairman (Tom) Wheeler promised to shield from such regulation,” David Cohen, a Comcast executive VP, said in a blog.Wheeler’s FCC last year approved new “net neutrality” rules opposed by the cable TV industry. Cable TV firms have been been squabbling with the agency over broadband privacy issues, as well as the agency’s plans to open up the set-top box market to more competition.The new rules for business data services could be approved by the end of 2016.“Cable’s entry into the market for business data services over the last few years has resulted in improved services and lower prices for businesses all across America,” said the National Cable & Telecommunications Association in a statement. “It is disappointing that Chairman Wheeler is responding to this unquestionably positive development by asking the commission to consider imposing onerous new rate regulation on these competitive services.”

409,CHTR,"Amid growing regulatory headwinds on the cable TV side of its business, Comcast (CMCSA) might again build up its content side by acquiring movie studio DreamWorks Animation (DWA).DreamWorks stock surged 17% in afternoon trading on the stock market today on multiple reports that Comcast is in talks to acquire the movie studio. Comcast did not comment on the DreamWorks speculation during its Q1 earnings conference call early Wednesday.Comcast posted Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views, as the cable TV firm added 53,000 video subscribers. Comcast owns NBCUniversal, where filmed entertainment revenue slipped 4.3% in Q1 vs. the year-earlier quarter, after surging 46% in 2015.Comcast is in talks to pay $3 billion or more for DreamWorks, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal and other media outlets.Aside from producing movies, DreamWorks has been creating original content for Web video streamers Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN). DreamWorks owns AwesomenessTV, which develops shows for millennials, young adults ages 18 to 34.Verizon Communications (VZ) in early April acquired a 24.5% stake in AwesomenessTV for $159 million. One looming question is whether Verizon and its content partner Hearst hold rights to buy the remainder of AwesomenessTV if DreamWorks is sold to a competitor such as Comcast. ""We have not made the terms of the agreements public,"" a Verizon spokesperson told IBD.DreamWorks'

410,CHTR,"Comcast’s (CMCSA) programming costs should moderate after 2017, boosting the cable TV side of its business, while its NBCUniversal division gets a lift from its own contract renewals, says a bullish Nomura report.Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente expects Comcast to report a strong first quarter. Comcast is slated to post Q1 earnings on April 27. Some analysts have been raising estimates for Comcast’s Q1 video subscriber additions.“Comcast is likely to meet or beat Q1 expectations,” said DiClemente in the report. “We expect 2016 to be a strong year of execution for Comcast, driven by video and broadband subscriber upside, as well as NBCU tailwinds from retransmission and affiliate fee growth, constructive parks trends and the Rio Olympics.”Comcast stock has gained more than 10% in 2016, and was down a fraction, near 62, in early trading in the stock market today.“After 2017, we believe Comcast likely has the majority of its major programming rights locked in until around 2020, suggesting substantial earnings potential and operating leverage in the out years,” said DiClemente. “Comcast (also) stands to benefit from the other side of the rights negotiation table through its ownership of NBCUniversal.”He says NBCU has upcoming renewals with Dish Network (DISH) and Verizon Communications (VZ).Comcast is the nation’s No. 1 cable TV provider. Charter Communications (CHTR) will be No. 2 if federal regulators approve its acquisitions of Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks. The Federal Communications Commission is expected to approve the Charter-Time Warner Cable deal with conditions, but California regulators may not green-light the merger until May.

411,CHTR,"Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) could shake up the U.S. residential broadband market by 2020 by deploying 5G wireless services to homes, challenging cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR), says Goldman Sachs.While 5G is expected to provide much faster data speeds, another market opportunity for AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US (TMUS) will be applications that require always-on, low-data-rate connections, says Goldman Sachs in a new research report. The apps involve data-gathering from industrial sensors, home appliances and other devices often referred to as part of the Internet of Things.Simona Jankowski, a Goldman Sachs analyst, says that some chipmakers, network gear suppliers and software companies will see an upside in 5G deployment. Jankowski says that Broadcom (AVGO),  Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO), cell tower operator Crown Castle (CCI), and bandwidth service provider Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO) could see upside from 5G deployment.“We expect pre-standard 5G commercial deployments to begin in the U.S. in 2017, when AT&T and Verizon plan to be first in the world to roll out fixed wireless 5G broadband to the home, followed by pre-standard 5G mobile networks in Korea in time for the 2018 Olympics,” wrote Jankowski in the report.U.S. regulators are focused on opening up high-frequency airwaves, also called millimeter wave spectrum, for 5G services.“Europe led the 3G transition, with industry giants such as Ericsson (ERIC) and Nokia (NOK) leading the way,” said Jankowski. “With 4G, the baton passed to the U.S., driven by a new group of industry leaders such as Qualcomm and Apple (AAPL). With China, Korea and Japan targeting 5G rollouts on par with or ahead of their Western counterparts, it bears watching whether the wireless industry’s center of gravity shifts once again (to Asia).”The Goldman Sachs analyst says that 5G also could have upside for Cisco, Intel, Zayo and Crown Castle.“We view Cisco’s market leading position in IoT as a strategic differentiator, given that 5G will likely be closely coupled with IoT,”  Jankowski added. “We expect Intel’s server and networking business to benefit from increased data traffic and greater demand for compute-intensive data analytics.“As the largest operator of small cell networks in the U.S. and one of the largest pure-play providers of dark fiber in large metros respectively, Crown Castle and Zayo look well positioned for this long-term investment cycle.”

412,CHTR,"Charter Communications (CHTR) is moving closer to gaining federal regulators’ approval for acquiring Time Warner Cable (TWC) -- a deal that could set the stage for assets swaps among cable TV firms, including Comcast (CMCSA), analysts say.The Federal Communications Commission reportedly is set to greenlight the Charter-TWC merger, with conditions, though the deal is still being studied by California’s state regulators. Charter stock rose to just shy of a record high on the report.Regulators thwarted Comcast’s proposed purchase of TWC in early 2015. Europe-based Altice Group, however, expects to gain approval for its purchase of Cablevision Systems (CVC) in May, the company said. Altice earlier acquired Suddenlink Communications.If both the Charter-TWC and Altice-Cablevision deals sail through, cable TV firms are likely to explore asset swaps of cable systems in different markets, says a Barclays research report.“Post the completion of pending cable deals, there is some likelihood of potential asset swaps between the remaining distributors to align footprints more closely and extract more in synergies,” said Barclays. “While the regulatory push-back is fair to consider in this instance, we note that the FCC has concluded in the past that pro-competitive effects of clustering of cable systems tend to outweigh the negatives.”Even if the FCC approves the Charter-TWC merger, California’s OK might not come until late May, analysts say. Charter also plans to buy privately held Bright House Networks.Netflix's (NFLX) support has smoothed the path for Charter's deals, analysts say.Both TWC and Cablevision offer services in the New York City area, a big market.RBC Capital says the FCC might still be opposed to any sizable acquisitions by Comcast, the nation’s No. 1 cable TV firm. Comcast also owns NBCUniversal.“Comcast would be unlikely to be allowed to acquire a major cable firm or programmer, but could acquire long-distance assets, a wireless operator, or could engage in clustering and swaps with other cable operators,” RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin wrote in a recent research report.Charter stock rose 6% in the stock market today, to 198.16. Charter peaked at 199 last March. Time Warner Cable stock rose 3.3% Wednesday.

413,CHTR,"With Verizon Communications (VZ) stock up nearly 17% and AT&T (T) soaring over 14%, the S&P telecommunications services sector is poised to lead the S&P 500’s 10 sectors in Q1 performance.As of afternoon trading in the stock market today, the S&P telecom services sector ranked tops, with utilities the only other sector posting a double-digit gain, for the first three months of 2016.“Absent some blow-away window dressing late in the session, that’s the way"" the quarter will end up, S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt told IBD.The S&P telecom services sector is up over 15% in Q1.High dividend-paying Verizon and AT&T are among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 100 this year.Smaller phone companies also have outperformed, with CenturyLink (CTL) jumping 26%, Frontier Communications (FTR) up 20% and Windstream Holdings (WIN) gaining nearly 17%.Among wireless-only service providers, shares of  T-Mobile US (TMUS) are down about 2% and Sprint (S) stock is near down 4.5%. Neither T-Mobile nor debt-laden Sprint pay dividends.Though they’re not in the S&P telecom services group, cable TV companies also posted solid returns in Q1. Shares of Charter Communications (CHTR)  and Time Warner Cable (TWC), which plan to merge, are both up 10% in Q1. Analysts expect the Charter-TWC deal to close in May.Comcast (CMCSA) stock is up 8% this year, and shares of Cablevision Systems (CVC) have edged up over 3%.The Q1 laggards have been the financial, health care and consumer discretionary sectors.Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, says Verizon and AT&T have benefited from global interest rates falling and “risk appetites withering.”“Whether the telco rally has legs will depend on fundamentals and growth and perhaps a change in industry structure,” Moffett said in a research report.Federal regulators, though, have been opposed to wireless consolidation, such as a Sprint and T-Mobile merger.AT&T has also been boosted by its purchase of satellite TV broadcaster DirecTV Group, analysts say.At Barclays, analyst Amir Rozwadowski in a report said that while the “flight to safety trade” isn’t showing signs of dispersing, investors may look at fundamentals more, going forward.IBD’s Telecom Services-Integrated group ranks No. 39 out of 197 industry sectors.

423,CHTR,"Here's a match made in heaven, or at least low Earth orbit: Boeing's (BA) aerospace expertise combined with Apple's (AAPL) consumer-product savvy.If the two form a partnership to provide broadband access via thousands of satellites, it could transform how you – and the machines that surround your life – will connect to the internet.Boeing already has a plan to develop, launch and operate a constellation of 3,000 satellites in low Earth orbit. Apple is reportedly in talks with Boeing to be an investor-partner in the project. With Apple on board, hundred-year-old Boeing could beat out the likes of Facebook (FB), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Tesla (TSLA) co-founder Elon Musk's SpaceX in the race to create a new internet in space and capture hundreds of billions of dollars. In the process, Boeing also could disrupt the telecom market and enable emerging technologies, ranging from smart devices to self-driving cars, that are expected to send the appetite for spectrum soaring.""We are seeing an almost insatiable demand for commercial communication bandwidth,"" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at a conference earlier this month.At first glance, the satellite business may seem like a stretch for Apple. But consider that the company has sold more than a billion iPhones globally, sometimes with troublesome connections, and is looking at opportunities further afield such as mobile payments and autonomous driving, which will rely on access to robust, widespread wireless capabilities.Meanwhile, Boeing has been in the business of building and launching satellites for decades, but isn't in the mass-market consumer game and is seeing slowing demand for its commercial jets and military planes. Boeing won't comment on a possible Apple collaboration, but Bloomberg reported in April that Apple hired two Google satellite executives for a new hardware team.Josh Sullivan, director and senior equity analyst at Seaport Global Securities, doubts that Boeing would work directly with consumers or that Apple would develop rocket technology.""The most likely arrangement would be for Boeing to supply the satellite delivery and operation expertise and for Apple to handle some of the satellite hardware but more focused on the consumer side,"" he said.Hardware is needed on the ground as well as in space.The maker of iPhones and iPads would not only provide mass-market expertise, but could offer know-how on miniaturizing technology so that personal gadgets can connect to satellites without bulky equipment. Technology would also be required to prevent data links from rapidly draining the charge from devices that fit in pockets and bags.Even if an Apple partnership fails to materialize, Boeing will forge ahead with its satellite plans. It has a sprawling factory in Southern California that produces satellites and is retooling it to churn them out faster. Also, Boeing already makes broadband satellites, and last month launched a fourth Boeing-made Inmarsat-5 satellite for Inmarsat's Global Xpress mobile-broadband network.Last year, Boeing applied for a Federal Communications Commission license that would help the aerospace giant ""contribute to the public interest by injecting new competition and expanded capabilities into the broadband satellite services industry."" Boeing also said in a filing that new satellites would ""foster the widespread availability of broadband services, including to unserved and underserved regions and populations.""Sullivan said Boeing has been reluctant to say how much it will invest in the project and is looking for investors like Apple to keep its research-and-development spending profile low.But Boeing isn't the only company that sees the market potential.Satellite-internet company OneWeb is looking to build a network for global broadband access and is working with Boeing's European rival Airbus (EADSY) to develop satellites that cost less than $1 million each. That compares with the $130 million price tag for a fifth Inmarsat satellite, which is being built by Europe's Thales Alenia Space. OneWeb plans to launch the first of its 700 satellites next year and start providing broadband access a year later.Another rival looming is SpaceX. After disrupting the rocket market, in which Boeing is a dominant player, Musk's company has plans to build its own constellation of satellites with launches expected to start in 2019.In November, the company filed a request with the FCC to launch 800 satellites to create a system ""designed to provide a wide range of broadband and communications services for residential, commercial, institutional, government and professional users worldwide."" Eventually, SpaceX plans to have more than 4,400 satellites in orbit and has put the price tag at up to $15 billion.""The only reason you would pursue it would be if there was the large prize of the global communications industry in your sights worth hundreds of billions,"" Sullivan said.In fact, Musk sees so much revenue potential from the business that he said in a video leaked to the Wall Street Journal earlier this year that he wants to use the money from satellites to fund the development of a city on Mars.The stakes are high for today's dominant providers of internet service, such as Verizon Communications (VZ), AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR).While existing satellite-based connections are often slower than land-based ones, Boeing, SpaceX and others plan to offer improved speeds by putting satellites at altitudes of less than 1,000 miles vs. more than 20,000, and create overlapping coverage with their massive fleets. Musk wants to capture more than half of long-distance internet traffic.""Connectivity will evolve away from terrestrial-based connectivity to satellite-based connectivity,"" said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer for Tigress Financial Partners, noting a satellite constellation's ability to cover more areas with high speeds.So far, telecoms like AT&T and Verizon have been quiet on the subject of satellites, while Silicon Valley has taken steps to enter the space.Eventually tech firms will want to provide their own wireless services, Feinseth said, pointing out that tech giants have plenty of cash on hand and could use it to further their business models by increasing connectivity and access to their products online.Facebook built its AMOS-6 Satellite with France's Eutelsat Communications to help bring the internet to remote locations. But it was destroyed last year in a launch accident involving a SpaceX rocket. And while not a satellite effort, Google's Project Loon uses balloons to expand internet coverage to rural areas across the globe. Google has also invested in SpaceX's venture.""The providers of connectivity aren't even looking at alternative sources of connectivity, but the ones that use the connectivity are,"" Feinseth said.The challenge from the tech sector is also coming on the launch side. After seeing Musk succeed with SpaceX, his billionaire peers are jumping in too.Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen's Stratolaunch and Orbital ATK (OA) have partnered to build the world's largest plane, with a wingspan of 385 feet and six engines, designed to carry rockets to the edge of space that will deliver 1,000-pound satellites into orbit.Blue Origin, Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' space company, is building its own New Glenn launch vehicle to deliver satellites for OneWeb.Not to be outdone, Boeing is working with the Pentagon's secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to build the XS-1 Phantom Express, an experimental reusable space plane that would be able to launch satellites. The plane is expected to fly five to 10 times the speed of sound.To be sure, the explosive growth in the Internet of Things will likely leave plenty of demand, especially in local traffic, for land-based providers of internet connections, which may have to form a hybrid network with satellites to accommodate the sheer volume of data. OneWeb even plans to partner with land-based providers.Market-tracker Gartner estimated earlier this year that the number of connected ""things"" will jump by 31% this year vs. 2016, to 8.4 billion, then more than double to 20.4 billion by 2020.Automotive systems, smart TVs and digital set-top boxes are driving the consumer side, while smart electric meters and commercial security cameras are driving business demand, Gartner said in February.""Connectivity services and consumer services will grow at a faster pace,"" said Denise Rueb, research director at Gartner, in a statement. ""Consumer IoT services are newer and growing off a small base. Similarly, connectivity services are growing robustly as costs drop, and new applications emerge.""In addition to finding cheaper ways to launch satellites, the costs of the satellites themselves must come down. One way is to mass produce satellites the size of a golf cart rather than custom build a satellite the size of a bus.Boeing, which has streamlined its satellite operations, is looking at 3D printing and automated testing to optimize manufacturing and follow methods already used in making small satellites, according to the Wall Street Journal.While the segment that includes satellites accounted for just 7% of Boeing's total revenue last year, CEO Muilenburg said in April that the satellite business is a ""growth area"" that ""thrives on industrial partnerships.""Moreover, it could be key to Boeing's long-term future as the era of the space-based internet approaches and looks to eclipse the land-based internet.""The large industrials have to change their business models,"" Sullivan said. ""They've been around for 100 years and their business models had evolved slowly, but now they need to evolve more quickly.""

424,CHTR,"If you're in the National Basketball Association playoffs, you want Steph Curry or LeBron James on your team. If you're managing a retirement account or taxable portfolio, why not tap into the Fidelity Investments' brain trust, which includes an army of analysts? Knowing cumulative stock moves in Fidelity's many mutual funds can help you choose your own buys and sells.Not all Fidelity funds make the same buys and sells, but it's instructive to see which leading stocks Fidelity overall bet more of its shareholders' money on the first quarter and where it lightened its weightings. Normally you'd have to track down and then sift through Securities and Exchange Commission filings by each of Fidelity's 358 stock and balanced funds. But CFRA, an independent research firm, has done that and crunched the numbers for you already.What CFRA found is that Fidelity's biggest sector weights were in information technology and consumer discretionary. By the end of Q1, Fidelity had nearly 27% of its shareholders' money at work in tech. It had more than 15% of its shareholders cash placed in consumer discretionary stocks.""Heading into 2017, economically sensitive information technology stocks were poised to benefit from a risk-on environment,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of ETF and mutual fund research. ""Further, Fidelity offers a number of growth-oriented strategies that tend to favor tech stocks.""Among Fidelity's 75 largest stock positions across all of its stock and balanced portfolios, PayPal (PYPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were tech-sector stocks in which the Fidelity complex increased its Q1 share-count percentage the most.Fidelity added 6.4 million shares of PayPal, for a 16.8% increase. It added 4.3 million shares of Qualcomm, for an 8.3% hike.Fidelity's $110.7 billion Contrafund (FCNTX) — the firm's largest stock mutual fund — and $15.5 billion Magellan (FMAGX) were among the funds investing in PayPal as of their latest disclosures.Fidelity's $14.8 billion OTC (FOCPX) and $30.5 billion Balanced (FBALX) funds were holders of Qualcomm.Still, Fidelity made an even bigger percentage increase in its share count in LyondellBasell Industries (LYB). Adding 5.2 million shares across its funds, Fidelity's share count jumped nearly 31%.The Netherlands-based company makes chemicals and polymers that are used packaging, home furnishings and automotive components. A materials manufacturer like that stands to benefit from any global expansion in GDP, such as the one that appears to be underway.Fidelity's Magellan, Balanced and OTC funds were investors in LyondellBasell.Drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had the third-largest Q1 percentage boost in share count by Fidelity funds. The 2.7 million share boost was a 9.9% increase.Amgen is a leading seller of LDL cholesterol-battling drugs. A judge recently sided with Amgen in a patent lawsuit against Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY). The ruling is under appeal.Fidelity's $9.4 billion Select Biotechnology (FBIOX) and $21 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) funds were Amgen holders.Fidelity's fourth-largest share-count percentage hike was for Charter Communications (CHTR). Fidelity's increase of nearly 800,000 shares was a 9.8% boost.Charter is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Telecom Services-Integrated industry group. Earnings per share rose 131% in the latest quarter on a 302% rise in sales. Its three-year sales growth rate is 54%.IBD'S TAKE: See how Charter's additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against that of rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup.Fidelity's $7.4 billion Dividend Growth (FDGFX) and $1.6 billion Trend funds were Charter investors.Fidelity's build up of Qualcomm shares was the fund family's fifth-biggest increase. Its boosts in Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were its next two largest percentage increases.Fidelity boosted its share count in Citigroup by 5.9 million shares, a 7.5% increase. Its step up of about 550,000 shares in Goldman Sachs was also a 7.5% increase.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stocks Buys And Sells Retirement Account Hot Sauce?P-s-s-st!

425,CHTR,"The nation's two biggest cable TV firms, Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on Monday announced a wireless partnership, a move that will likely spark more speculation over their long-term strategy and possible joint acquisitions.Under the agreement, Comcast and Charter will need each others' approval over a period of one year if they make a wireless acquisition or agree to a merger, according to a report.Comcast in April announced that it would sell wireless services, mainly to its own cable TV customers, by leasing network capacity from Dow component Verizon Communications (VZ). There's been speculation over a possible Comcast-Verizon merger as well as a Verizon purchase of Charter, whose biggest shareholder is media baron John Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBRDA).Charter has stated it will roll out a mobile service in 2018, also under a network leasing deal with Verizon. In the telecom industry, companies that lease wholesale network capacity are called MVNOs, for mobile virtual network operators.In a release, Comcast and Charter said they ""have agreed to work only together with respect to national mobile network operators, through potential commercial arrangements, including MVNOs and other material transactions in the wireless industry, for a period of one year.""In addition, Comcast and Charter said they will ""explore working together in a number of potential operational areas in the wireless space, including: creating common operating platforms; technical standards development and harmonization; device forward and reverse logistics; and emerging wireless technology platforms.""Verizon is scheduled to hold an analyst meeting after the market close today.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile stock hit an all-time high of 68.88 in intraday trading on May 2 amid telecom merger speculation. T-Mobile's revenue growth stands out among the nation's big four national wireless firms. Learn more about T-Mobile's growth and chart pattern at IBD Stock Checkup.Another scenario that has circulated would have Comcast and Charter team up to acquire T-Mobile US (TMUS), controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY). Amid intensified competition, T-Mobile has been gaining subscriber and revenue share vs. the wireless industry's two giants, Verizon and AT&T (T).While Comcast bought radio spectrum in a recent government auction of airwaves owned by local TV stations, Charter did not.Comcast shares rose 0.5% to 39.20 at the close on the stock market today. Comcast retook a 38.54 buy point on Friday following a sell-off earlier in the week among big media stocks.Charter shares sank 3.3% to 323.81.Shares of Verizon, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 0.1% to 46.63.

426,CHTR,"Internet users have an insatiable need for speed — and that's been a boon for telecom infrastructure firms like Dycom Industries (DY).The voracious appetite for faster wireline and wireless networks is fueling the market that Dycom serves. Video, cloud-computing and Internet of Things applications are driving demand for more bandwidth on communications networks.So Dycom is benefiting from communications firms installing fiber-optic networks and wireless carriers upgrading to faster cellular networks like 5G.""Several industry participants have articulated plans to deploy multigigabit speeds, while others are preparing to do so,"" Dycom CEO Steven Nielsen said on a recent call with analysts. ""These industry developments have produced opportunities across a broad array of our existing customers, which in aggregate are without precedent for the industry in our experience.""For Dycom, that should mean an extension of its winning streak. The Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.-based company — a provider of specialty contracting services in the U.S. and Canada to telecom companies as well as electric and gas utilities — has posted 20% or greater year-over-year sales growth for the last seven quarters.In its fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 28, Dycom earned 82 cents a share excluding items, up 52% from the year-earlier period, on sales that rose 25% to $701 million. The company's results were boosted by deployments of 1-gigabit wireline networks for key customers.Dycom's biggest customer is AT&T (T), which accounted for 28% of revenue in the second quarter. Other major clients include Comcast (CMCSA), CenturyLink (CTL), Dow Jones industrial average component Verizon Communications (VZ), Windstream (WIN) and Charter Communications (CHTR).The split of its business last quarter was 68.1% in telecom, 24.4% for cable, 4.9% in facility-locating services, and electrical and other making up the rest.But Wall Street is forecasting Dycom's growth to slow during the near term. It seems the company has been on such a roll, it's going up against difficult comparisons.For the April quarter, analysts are modeling Dycom to earn $1.19 a share, up 10%, on sales of $736.7 million, up 11%. For the July quarter, Wall Street is looking for Dycom to earn $1.79 a share, up 9%, on sales of $849.4 million, up 8%.Still, Dycom sees opportunities in emerging wireless technologies, such as 5G networks, over the near to intermediate term. In a plus for the company, the deployment of faster wireless networks also leads to a boost in associated fiber-optic wireline deployments at those locations.For instance, Verizon has embarked on a major, multi-city fiber deployment with the aim of building out a fiber network that will support all of the company's businesses, including the deployment of 5G wireless.""We roughly size the initial phase of Verizon's fiber deployment at $5 billion to $7 billion over the next three years, which we believe could translate into $300 million-plus of annual incremental revenue opportunity for Dycom,"" Stifel analyst Noelle Dilts said in a report April 19. ""This could translate into $47 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and 64 cents of EPS.""And Verizon's project could be just the start, she said.IBD'S TAKE: Dycom Industries has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, meaning it has outperformed 97% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Dycom, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""While the size of the opportunity associated with a Verizon fiber rollout is important, the implications for the competitive dynamics of the industry are arguably of greater significance, as AT&T, Comcast, Charter and others will have to respond to Verizon's move,"" Dilts said.Dilts rates Dycom stock as buy with a price target of 120.Investors have driven Dycom stock to record highs. Dycom hit an all-time high of 109.65 on April 25. It broke out of a cup base with a 98.57 buy point on April 18. Shares ended trading Friday up 2.3% to 107.84.Canaccord Genuity analyst Bobby Burleson also is bullish on Dycom. He rates the stock as buy with a price target of 120.""Based on recent customer and supply-chain commentary, we believe Dycom is likely to continue to operate in a strengthening environment for fiber demand,"" Burleson said in an April 12 report. ""Customers maintain healthy fiber deployment schedules, with multiyear build plans at cable (operators) and telcos still in early stages.""Dycom expects to see initial deployments of 5G wireless systems this year and then ramping, Burleson said.Finally, FBR analyst Alex Rygiel rates Dycom as outperform with a price target of 120.The wireline infrastructure upgrade cycle is ""in the early innings of increased spending"" by telecom carriers and cable operators on 1-gigabit-per-second network deployments, Rygiel said in a note to clients.The analyst also raised his price target to 120 from 115 on March 2 after Dycom's second-quarter report, which beat consensus estimates for earnings per share and sales.""The quarter was positively affected by strong 1 Gbps (gigabit-per-second) fiber deployments and market-share gains,"" Rygiel wrote. ""The telecom wireline industry remains robust, with 1 Gbps deployments and the development of 5G technologies. We continue to believe that Dycom is the best-positioned contractor to benefit from these telecom trends, given its scale, market position, customer relationships and financial strength.""

427,CHTR,"FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler aims to throw open the set-top box market, a plan that has Comcast (CMCSA), AT&T (T) and other pay-TV providers steaming but could take years to play out.The Federal Communications Commission plans to make it easier for consumers to switch from set-top boxes leased monthly from pay-TV companies to new devices sold at retail by consumer electronics or Internet companies.The pay-TV industry is worried about more than just losing revenue from monthly set-top fees, which can cost $10 and up per month. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, Amazon.com (AMZN) and other new entrants would provide their own programming guide to consumers. Pay-TV firms fear losing the “customer relationship” and along with it the ability to collect viewership data, the key for targeted advertising.The FCC could approve Wheeler’s plan by year-end. Comcast, AT&T and other pay-TV firms would have two years to comply with technical standards that give new suppliers access to programming content. So in a worst-case situation, competing set-top TV devices could be available in 2019. The problem, says the FCC, is that about 99% of pay-TV customers lease boxes from their providers, paying about $20 billion a year, with often no viable alternative for reasons such as convenience.Yet, even if the current FCC approves Wheeler’s plan, a new chairman is expected to head the agency in 2017 after November’s presidential election. A Republican appointee would likely not follow through on the set-top market overhaul, while another Democratic FCC chairman might have other priorities, says Paul Gallant, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners.And if the FCC forges ahead with the set-top plan, a court battle is likely, and it could drag on.In the meantime, pay-TV companies would take steps to “maintain consumer inertia and impede adoption,” says Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Cable companies have fought FCC attempts to open up the set-top market for 20 years.In a few years, the uproar over Wheeler’s proposal could be much ado over nothing, some observers say, as changes in technology and the way we all view video might make this a moot point. AT&T, for example, plans on selling DirecTV’s programming over the Internet starting late this year, and consumers won’t need the satellite TV broadcaster’s set-top boxes anymore.Some analysts say the future battle will be over the highest-spending consumers -- the ones that now buy more premium channels,  pay-per-view and, in the future, might pony up for cloud movie storage or other perks. Those are the same subscribers advertisers will be interested in as well.Wheeler's proposal zeros in on such users, and it's ""apt to emerge as the single biggest threat” to cable TV companies since satellite TV rivals emerged 30 years ago, says Citigroup analyst Jason Bazinet.“If Silicon Valley gets its way, pay-TV firms will provide the costly infrastructure to deliver bits of information,” Bazinet said in a report. “And they will provide programming at scale -- relegating the pay-TV firms to being content wholesalers.”Here’s a run-down of some companies that have a stake in the set-top box battle, and the threats or opportunities it may present:
"
428,CHTR,"Federal regulators say 104 companies -- including, as expected, AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) -- have applied to bid on airwaves owned by TV broadcasters, but analysts are still tempering expectations for the auction.While the Federal Communications Commission late Friday released the list of applicants, it was still unclear just which telecom companies are tied to some of the 104 bidding entities. The FCC is expected to release a more detailed list soon.“The more interesting takeaways will evolve as we learn more about the underlying ownership of the bidding entities,” said Michael Rollins, a Citigroup analyst, in a research report.“Initial applicant lists for FCC auctions can be a bit difficult to decipher since many bidders will submit applications through subsidiaries with different names,” Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman wrote in a report.The FCC plans to begin the ""Broadcast Incentive Auction"" on March 29. The auction, which could last five to six months, will free up an estimated 60 to 80 megahertz of prime, low-frequency spectrum for wireless services.Based on public statements, analysts expect Comcast (CMCSA) and Dish Network (DISH) to be among the bidders. Cable firm Charter Communications (CHTR) is not among the 104 listed companies, but John Malone-controlled Liberty Global (LBTYA) is included.Despite speculation that Sprint (S)-owner SoftBank (SFBTY) could take part in the auction, there’s no sign of the Japanese telecom in initial filings.In a report published on Monday, Goldman Sachs estimated phone and cable TV companies may spend only $21 billion in the auction, though other bidders could raise auction proceeds as high as $30 billion.Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has ruled itself out, and no Internet companies are in the 104 public applicants, though ties to some bidding entities might exist.A Bloomberg survey has estimated the auction will raise only $33 billion, much less than the $60 billion figure floated by some observers in mid-2015.Citigroup estimates bids could reach $43 billion, however, in the neighborhood of 2015’s “AWS-3” auction, which had 80 listed eligible bidders.

429,CHTR,"Comcast[ticker symb=CMCSA] is pulling out all the stops marketing its Xfinity video service and its new set-top boxes, at a time when the FCC plans to stoke set-top competition.The nation’s No. 1 cable TV firm advertised its Xfinity video-on-demand service during Super Bowl 50, where the big game's ad rates were quoted at $2.5 million-plus for 30-second slots.Moreover, Comcast this year launched a social media campaign targeting millennials. Comcast paid Twitter (TWTR) to co-develop short Web videos from 19 social media personalities based on their Xfinity product experiences. The social media personalities posted videos on platforms such as Instagram and Vine while Twitter promoted them in tweets.Meanwhile, Comcast says its field technicians are installing 40,000 advanced X1 set-top boxes per day in homes. Some 30% of Comcast’s video customers -- more than 7 million -- were using X1 set-top boxes as of Jan. 1. By year-end, Comcast expects at least half of its 22 million video subscribers will be using Internet-ready, X1 set-top boxes in their homes.Comast is getting pay-back for its Xfinity marketing push. Comcast added 89,000 video customers in Q4, its biggest quarterly net gain in TV subscribers in eight years.Some analysts forecast Comcast could see a net add in TV subscribers in 2016, despite a trend toward Internet video among young adults, some of whom have never subscribed to pay-TV.“We've got to play offense with things like X1,” Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said on the company earnings conference call this month.Comcast’s capital spending is expected to rise 8% in 2016 to $9.2 billion, driven by its X1 deployment and spending at NBCU Universal theme parks.The X1 entertainment platform provides access to live broadcast, on-demand video and DVR-stored content.In November, Comcast partnered with 30 broadcast and cable networks to bring short-form Web clips to X1 set-tops, as part of its video-on-demand (VOD) lineup.Internet search, Web browsing and a Netflix (NFLX) app are not, for now, part of X1.DVR-stored content is in the Internet cloud, not the set-top, providing more space. Customers can watch DVR content on mobile devices as well as TV sets.Analysts say Comcast has put a lot of work into developing a cloud-based TV channel guide and user interface, a voice-controlled remote, programming recommendations, on-screen sports app and social media features for sharing video.""X1 represents the industry's best-in-class technology due to the volume of content available, the flexible cloud infrastructure and the simplicity of its user interface,"" Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente said in a recent research report.Comcast has a huge VOD library of movies and TV shows. It aims to take advantage of marketing opportunities, such as the Oscars. Comcast in February provided some 20 past Academy Award winners on X1 VOD  as well as content gleaned from past Oscar telecasts.With X1, one goal is to drive up subscribers’ average monthly spending, with VOD and other purchases.Aside from video subscriber gains, the company eyes ad gains. Comcast aims to use viewing data gleaned from set-top boxes for targeted advertising -- inserting commercials for specific audiences into VOD and other programming. To protect privacy, set-top viewing data is aggregated and anonymous.Comcast has acquired two companies, FreeWheel and Visible World, to build up its targeted-advertising platform.The cable TV firm also has been working with content companies.  Amid falling TV audience ratings, they’re eager to obtain TV data on par with digital platforms.Advertisers have upped their spending on the Internet, where they can target individuals based on what websites they visit and what searches they conduct.Amid Comcast’s big Xfinity push, federal regulators now aim to increase competition in the set-top box market. The Federal Communications Commission plans to make it easier for consumers to switch from set-top boxes leased monthly from pay-TV companies to new devices sold at retail by consumer electronics or Internet companies.Besides Comcast, the initiative could impact Charter Communications (CHTR), Time Warner Cable (TWC),  AT&T (T) and other pay-TV firms that lease set-top boxes for a monthly fee.The new set-top rules could be approved by year-end, though the pay-TV industry is waging a fight against them, with some support in Congress. The cable firms say the new rules aren't needed in an arena where innovation sparks fast changes. In any case, it could take until 2019 before more of these set-top consumer products appear in the market, because pay-TV companies would have two years to comply with new regulations.By then, Comcast would have a big head start in rolling out X1 technology. Still, new entrants in the set-top box market could match many X1 features, says Joel Espelien, an analyst at the Diffusion Group.“X1 is nice, but I seriously doubt any of its features are defensible in the long run,” he said.Even features such as cloud-based DVR storage may not set X1 apart, he added. “We see declining interest in DVR among millennials,” added Espelien. “They don't get why they have to 'record' things.”

430,CHTR,"Federal regulators and Verizon Communications (VZ) have zeroed in on airwaves that could make the U.S. the global leader in rolling out 5G wireless services.One market opportunity for 5G may be as a challenger to the cable TV industry’s broadband dominance. Think Verizon Wireless, not Verizon's FiOS-branded landline service, vs. the likes of Comcast (CMCSA) or Charter Communications (CHTR).First, though, airwaves need to be freed up for 5G. That's where high-frequency radio spectrum, also called millimeter wave, comes in. In particular, U.S. regulators are focused on the 28 gigahertz frequency band, analysts say. Most wireless phone services today use radio frequency below 3 GHz.If 28 GHz or millimeter wave rings a bell, that’s because several fixed wireless startups (WinStar, Teligent, Nextlink, Terabeam) tried and failed in commercializing products relying on high-frequency airwaves during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Business models were suspect, and their LMDS (local multipoint distribution services) were susceptible to interference from rain and other environmental conditions.When the tech bubble burst in 2000-01, the LMDS startups perished. Technology advances, however, could make the high-frequency airwaves prime candidates for 5G.""In the 1990s, with LMDS, mobile data wasn't mature, and neither was the Internet, and neither was the electronics industry -- it couldn't make low cost, mmWave devices,"" said Ted Rappaport, founding director of NYU Wireless, New York University's research center on millimeter-wave technologies.""Wi-Fi was really brand new then, and broadband backhaul was not even built out. LMDS was originally conceived to be like fiber, to serve as backhaul (long-distance), or point-to-multipoint, and was not for mobile services. Fast forward to today, backhaul is in place to accommodate demand, and electronics at mmWave frequencies are being mass-produced in cars. Demand for data is increasing more than 50% a year, and the only way to continue to supply capacity to users is to move up to (millimeter wave).""The Federal Communications Commission in October opened a study looking at 28, 37, 39, and 60 GHz as the primary bands for 5G. While the FCC says 28 GHz airwaves show promise, some countries have been focused on higher frequencies rather than 28 GHz.FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, speaking at a U.S. Senate committee hearing on March 2, said: “While international coordination is preferable, I believe we should move forward with exploration of the 28 GHz band.”Wheeler said that the U.S. will lead the world in 5G and allocate spectrum ""faster than any nation on the planet.""Verizon, meanwhile, on Feb. 22 agreed to buy privately held XO Communications’ fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion. In a side deal, Verizon will also lease XO’s wireless spectrum in the 28 GHz to 31 GHz bands, with an option to buy for $200 million by the end of 2018.XO’s spectrum covers some of the largest U.S. metro areas, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Miami, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as Tampa, Fla. and Austin, Texas.Verizon CFO Fran Shammo commented on the XO deal at a Morgan Stanley conference on March 1.“Right now we have licenses issued to us from the FCC for trial purposes at 28 GHz. The XO deal gave us additional 28 GHz,” Shammo said. “The rental agreement enables us to include that (XO spectrum) in some of our R&D development with 28 GHz. So that just continues the path that we're on in launching 5G as soon as the FCC clears spectrum.”He noted that Japan and South Korea plan to test 5G services using 28 GHz and 39 GHz airwaves.Some analysts doubt 28 GHz airwaves will be on a fast track.“We are skeptical, not only on the timing of the availability of 28 GHz, but also its ultimate viability in a mobile wireless network,” Walter Piecyk, analyst at BTIG Research, said in a report.Boosting signal strength at higher frequencies is a challenge for wireless firms. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and also through walls, improving in-building services.One approach to increase propagation in millimeter wave bands, analysts say, is using more ""small-cell"" radio antennas, which increase network capacity.Wireless firms generally use large cell towers to connect mobile phone calls and whisk video and email to mobile phone users. They also install radio antennas on building rooftops, church steeples, or billboards. Suitcase-sized antennas used in small-cell technology are often mounted on lamp posts or utility poles.Verizon has been testing small-cell technology in Boston.Verizon says it will begin rolling out 5G commercially in 2017, though its plans are still vague. While many wireless service providers touted 5G plans and tests at the Mobile World Congress in February, makers of telecom network equipment are being cautious.“General consensus (at MWC) seemed to indicate that the 2020-time-frame will mark full-scale 5G deployments,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz said in a report.Verizon has said it doesn't expect 5G networks to replace existing 4G ones.While 5G is expected to provide much faster data speeds, wireless firms also expect applications that require always-on, low-data-rate connections. The apps involve data-gathering from industrial sensors, home appliances and other devices often referred to as part of the Internet of Things.Both Verizon and AT&T (T) have recently touted 5G speeds up to 1-gigabit-per-second. That's roughly 50 times faster than the average speeds of 4G wireless networks in good conditions.AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson recently said 5G speeds could match fiber-optic broadband connections to homes.At the Morgan Stanley conference, Verizon's Shammo also said 5G could be a ""substitute product for broadband."" Regulators would like to create new competition for cable TV companies. But, Verizon says, it's still early days.""With trials, we'll figure out exactly what we can deliver, what the base cases are,"" said Shammo. ""5G has the capability to be a substitute for broadband into the home with a fixed wireless solution. The question is can you deploy that technology and actually make money at a price that the consumer would pay?""Sanyogita Shamsunder, Verizon’s director of network infrastructure planning, says high frequencies can support 5G.“Radio frequency components today are able to support much wider bandwidth (think wide lanes on the highway) when compared to even 10 years ago. What it means is we are able to pump more bits at the same time,” said Shamsunder, in an email.“Due to improvements in antenna and RF technology,” she added, “we are able to support 100s of small tiny antennas on a small die the size of a quarter.”
"
431,CHTR,"Federal regulators appear set to go forward this spring with the auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters, but other spectrum-related developments loom as wild cards that could increase supply, thereby impacting wireless industry competition and M&As.Those other developments include the contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety; the re-emergence of LightSquared, renamed Ligado Networks, from Chapter 11; and whether wireless firms succeed in lobbying to use commercial LTE technology in unlicensed spectrum now allocated to Wi-Fi.The Federal Communications Commission still plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29. The auction, which could last five to six months, will free up an estimated 60 megahertz to 80 MHz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum for wireless services.Results of the spectrum auction could affect the competitive future of IBD Leaderboard company AT&T (T), which has seen accelerating growth in recent quarters, and rival Verizon Communications (VZ) -- a member of IBD’s Big Cap 20 -- as well as highly rated Comcast (CMCSA). AT&T and Verizon are expected to buy TV airwaves in the auction, and cable leader Comcast also will likely bid, say analysts. Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has ruled itself out.AT&T and Verizon own more than 70% of low-frequency airwaves in the top 100 U.S. markets. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and can pass through walls, improving in-building services.The FCC will impose a ""quiet period"" that bans negotiation over spectrum until the auction is over. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) has acquired some 75 MHz of midband spectrum -- which covers a little less territory than low-frequency spectrum -- but it lacks a wireless network partner and is in limbo until the auction ends, analysts say. Dish has filed to bid in the auction, but observers are uncertain that it will.The auction's outcome could well raise or lower the odds of some major deals, long rumored in the industry:-- that Comcast will acquire a wireless services provider;-- that a cable TV leader will strike an alliance with Verizon;-- that Verizon will enter into a spectrum-leasing deal with Dish;-- that Dish and T-Mobile will merge.But even beyond the auction, by early 2017, further developments involving the FirstNet contract, Ligado, unlicensed-LTE and satellite wireless firm Globalstar (GSAT) could impact Dish’s plans, as well as the spectrum strategies of AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. That’s because all these elements provide alternatives for network capacity, aside from the auction.Here’s a run-down of several scenarios:-- FirstNet. Whoever wins this first-responder contract would need to invest in network infrastructure. Congress has set aside 20 MHz of spectrum -- a wide swath of the airwaves -- in the ""D block"" of the 700 MHz frequency band for the public safety network.The winning bidder is expected to enter into a lease agreement with the FirstNet authority for access to the 20 MHz of prime airwaves. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.The government will award the FirstNet contract after the TV airwave auction ends, if the government's timetable proceeds as planned. Verizon has been viewed as the front-runner, but AT&T has made clear that it’s interested. T-Mobile (TMUS) could bid but faces long odds vs. AT&T and Verizon, analysts say.-- LTE-U. Verizon and T-Mobile have been biggest proponents of developing a technical standard that would allow 4G LTE commercial technology to use unlicensed spectrum. Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and the Wi-Fi Alliance, which certifies Wi-Fi network gear, have lobbied the FCC to protect unlicensed airwaves, saying that interference could impair Wi-Fi services. Apple (AAPL), a Wi-Fi Alliance member, has not said anything publicly.Verizon and AT&T claim that no special LTE-U equipment certification is needed as long as devices meet certain basic FCC rules for unlicensed spectrum. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has been backing LTE-U deployment. The FCC in February allowed Qualcomm to move ahead with LTE-U testing at two Verizon facilities to demonstrate that the technology would not interfere with Wi-Fi. Qualcomm and the Wi-Fi Alliance have been working on “coexistence” plans.The cable TV industry has a big stake in the outcome, analysts say, because Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and others have been expanding public Wi-Fi networks. While Verizon has targeted 3.5 GHz spectrum in the near term, it could try to carry out LTE-U in higher 5 GHz airwaves that cable TV firms covet.If LTE-U gets a green light, the Apple iPhone and other devices could support the technology by 2018.-- LightSquared, now Ligado. Former Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg is chairman of Ligado, while former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt is a board member.Ligado, controlled by private equity firms, has a sizable 35 MHz of midband spectrum. After emerging from bankruptcy, Ligado reached agreements with tractor maker Deere (DE) and GPS device maker Garmin (GRMN), resolving issues over potential global positioning system interference. While Ligado might provide services to industries such as energy or transport, or pursue next-generation 5G services, it could sell the airwaves as well.The company hasn’t spelled out its new business model, analysts say, and it’s still awaiting some FCC approvals to use the spectrum for commercial purposes.-- Globalstar.  The FCC has been studying Globalstar’s petition to use airwaves in the midfrequency 2.4 GHz block for wireless services. The Wi-Fi Alliance and other groups have opposed Globalstar’s plans, citing possible interference issues. Globalstar could lease capacity to a wireless firm or an Internet company if it wins at the FCC. Globalstar’s stock, though, has plunged about 50% in the past year to near 1.40 while its FCC approval has languished.Image provided by Shutterstock.

432,CHTR,"FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler’s proposal to open up the TV set-top market does not have the support of one of the biggest video streaming set-top makers, Roku, which has partnered with cable TV firms.“We have not been advocating for a rule making in this area at this time,” Tricia Mifsud, a Roku spokeswoman, told IBD. “While we are known for selling streaming players, it is only one area of our business. Customers also access our platform through smart TVs and streaming players that operators deploy.”Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are among cable TV firms that could be affected by Wheeler’s proposal. AT&T (T), which provides U-verse pay-TV service, also has protested Wheeler's set-top box rules.The Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote on whether to move forward with the set-top box initiative on Thursday. The agency could adopt new rules by year-end.Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has drawn the wrath of cable TV firms in the wake of the Wheeler’s proposal because it may target the TV advertising market.  Tivo (TIVO) is another company that could take advantage of new set-top box rules, analysts say.Wheeler aims to make it easier for consumers to switch from set-top boxes rented from cable TV companies to devices sold by consumer electronics or Internet companies. The FCC says making programming bundles sold by pay-TV companies accessible from a wider range of devices is not a threat to copyright protections.Roku recently raised $45.5 million in a funding round and appears to have shelved plans for an initial public offering.Critics say the FCC’s proposal is not needed because of technology and marketing shifts already underway.  Time Warner Cable in New York City is testing a cable service that doesn’t require a set-top box. Its slimmed-down programming package is available through a broadband connection and Roku’s streaming device.“In addition to Time Warner Cable, we also have a similar arrangement with Charter where they are buying streaming players to offer in a bundle,” added Roku’s Mifsud. “Overseas, we have partnerships with Sky in several countries and Telstra where we have licensed use of our platform and they have deployed their streaming video services to co-branded streaming players.”Amazon.com (AMZN), Roku and others sell Internet sticks, or dongles, that provide access to Web video. Some cable firms still do not provide access to Netflix (NFLX), or YouTube apps on their Internet-ready set-top boxes.

AT&T on April 10 acquired Straight Path Communications, which owns high-frequency airwaves.Improved radio antennas and more complex semiconductors are expected to make higher frequencies usable for 5G.Wireless companies aim to build  flexible 5G networks that provide both the high-bandwidth connections required by fast-moving, self-driving cars in urban areas and always-on, reliable, low-data-rate connections needed by parking meters, oil rig sensors or other devices. Highflying drones are another potential market.Meanwhile, shares in Dycom Industries (DY) leapt 5.8% to 103.15, clearing a 98.57 cup-base entry and hitting a record high. Dycom has told analysts that 5G buildouts could create more business rather than cannibalize its existing services to AT&T, Verizon and cable TV firms. Dycom digs small trenches where fiber-optic wiring is buried. It also strings fiber wiring aerially to homes and businesses via utility poles.""We see (the Corning deal)  as a significant positive for Dycom, as Verizon is its 4th largest customer,"" Jennifer Fritzsche, a Wells Fargo analyst, said in a note to clients. ""As Verizon builds more outside of its (landline) territory, it will have more opportunity to use third-party labor. With Dycom's fiber construction business five times larger than its next largest competitor, we see it as well-positioned to capture much of this converged wireline-wireless spend from Verizon.""RELATED:Straight Path Stock Jumps; Will Verizon Top AT&T's Big Premium?Verizon, Charter Talks Heating Up?

444,CHTR,"Broadband is quickly becoming the key growth driver for cable companies such as Charter Communications (CHTR) as they draw customers away from telcos.

445,CHTR,"X Walt Disney (DIS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA), CBS (CBS), Viacom (VIAB), Comcast (CMCSA) and other big companies sold off on cable advertising concerns. Meanwhile, Hulu, the streaming platform jointly backed by four major media conglomerates, has officially entered the live-television fray with a more-than-50-channel bundle, priced at $39.99 a month.Time Warner (TWX) said Wednesday that advertising revenue fell 2% in the first quarter vs. a year earlier, with declines continuing the quarter. Comcast said last week that its NBCUniversal ad revenue fell in Q1. Pay-TV operators suffered big subscriber losses in Q1 as well.CBS tumbled 3.35% on the stock market today. Disney lost 2.4%, dropping below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. Viacom reversed sharply to sink 7.5%, below its 200-day line. Fox sold off 5.1%. Comcast sank 2%, closing just below a buy point cleared after reporting earnings. Dish Network (DISH) fell 4.4% and Charter Communications (CHTR) 3.9%, both undercutting their 50-day lines. Time Warner, which is being acquired by AT&T (T), dipped 0.3%. AT&T slid 1.4% to a five-month low.Meanwhile, Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins announced the live-TV service's beta launch at its annual upfronts presentation Wednesday, calling it a ""natural extension of our business.""Disney, Fox, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Time Warner all have a stake in Hulu, which explains its fairly comprehensive channel offerings, such as ABC, NBC, Fox, E!, Bravo, USA, TBS, CNN and CNBC. The service also includes access to the platform's streaming library.Live sports stations are also part of the basket. The live service includes NBC Sports, CBS Sports Network, Fox Sports channels, TNT and a number of different ESPN stations.Like rival products from Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue and Dish Network's Sling TV, Hulu's package isn't all-encompassing, although it does include CBS (CBS), which has been building out its own over-the-top streaming presence through CBS All Access.As Vulture points out, the Hulu bundle lacks AMC Networks (AMCX) channels and Viacom-owned MTV, Comedy Central and VH1.For comparison, Vue's comparably priced $39.99-a-month Access tier, the most basic of four levels, offers around 45 channels. (Its high-end $74.99-a-month Ultra level includes 90 channels, including HBO and Showtime.) Sling's $25 monthly Blue-level subscription includes 45 channels but no CBS or ESPN.Hulu's service includes 50 hours of recorded storage, but 200 more hours in ""enhanced cloud DVR"" will run subscribers an extra $14.99 a month. Vue offers unlimited cloud DVR storage for 28 days. YouTube TV, from Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, has launched a $35-a-month service in several major cities with no cloud storage limits either.Both CBS and Viacom report quarterly results Thursday.

447,CHTR,"The U.S. economy added 98,000 jobs in March, as the jobless rate fell to 4.5%, the lowest since April 2007, the Labor Department reported on Friday.While Wall Street economists expected a 180,000-job gain, the tepid rise looks mostly like an effect of a record warm February followed by a Northeast snowstorm in mid-March. The bigger deal is the drop in the jobless rate, which Wall Street had expected to hold steady at 4.7%.The combination of a robust report on private hiring in March from payroll processor ADP, which estimated a 263,000 gain, and an extremely robust report on Friday from the household survey, suggests that the job market continues to be on a very firm footing.The payroll number comes from a survey of establishments, which — unlike the ADP report — can be thrown off by bad weather during the survey week. The unemployment rate comes from the household survey, which showed that the ranks of the employed rose by 472,000 last month after a 340,000 increase in February.Average hourly wages rose 0.2% to $26.14, matching the 0.2% increase expected. Hourly wages rose by 2.7% from a year ago, but that number looks like it could rise significantly by June. That's because March and April of 2016 saw the biggest wage gains last year, helped along by a big wage hike at Wal-Mart (WMT), so the comparison will be much easier by June.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite turned modestly lower on the stock market today immediately after its release but rallied to close mostly flat as markets looked past the disappointing headline number to the labor market's underlying strength. The 10-year Treasury yield, which was lower before the report on a safety bid after the overnight U.S. bombing of a Syrian airfield, also recovered.Before Wednesday, the March jobs report didn't seem to be a big one. That's because markets already are pricing in a Federal Reserve rate hike in June. But Wednesday's revelation that Fed policymakers expect to begin unwinding the $4.5 trillion central bank balance sheet before year-end raised the stakes. Although markets initially reacted to the report as though it would keep pressure off the Fed, the opposite may be true.Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday that companies announced plans for hiring 289,000 workers in the first three months of 2017, the biggest first-quarter hiring plans on record and more than 10 times the total in early 2016. Some of that may have been because President Trump has encouraged such announcements, even if some of the plans don't appear exactly new. Amazon (AMZN) said it will add 100,000 jobs by mid-2018, while Dow component Wal-Mart is adding 10,000 jobs this year.Other recent hiring announcements have come from Charter Communications (CHTR) and Halliburton (HAL), which is a big change from last year's job cuts for the oilfield services firm.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market's uptrend is under pressure, meaning investors should be more cautious in buying stocks and quick to cut losses. Read The Big Picture each day to stay on top of the market's trend.Minutes from last month's Fed meeting revealed that most policymakers ""judged that a change to the committee's reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year.""Instead of continuing to reinvest all of the principal from maturing bonds, which keeps the balance sheet steady, the Fed would gradually let its portfolio run off, assuming the economy continues as expected.As explained by University of Oregon economist Tim Duy, the Fed seems to be signaling that it will tighten monetary policy at a pace roughly equivalent to a quarter-point rate hike every three months. That would mean another hike in September, before the Fed ""switches gears to balance-sheet reduction"" in December.Yet markets aren't currently pricing in another rate hike after June until December. Unless economic conditions soften, expect market pricing to speed up the timetable for rate hikes, as long as the labor market remains in good shape.Keep in mind that ""good"" is in the eye of the beholder. In early March, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that job growth of around 180,000 per month is ""notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor-force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.""Even after January and February payroll gains were revised down by a combined 38,000, the average job gain over the past three months is 178,000, which is plenty fast, as far as the Fed is concerned.RELATED:How The Fed Surprised Markets Again, This Time Hitting StocksFebruary Jobs Growth Strong, But Not Too Strong To Unnerve Investors, Fed

449,CHTR,"AT&T (T), Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) have more incentive to launch or expand nationwide internet TV services in the wake of Congress's repeal of data privacy rules, says a Pacific Crest Securities analyst.Lawmakers voted March 30 to overturn Federal Communication Commission rules that would have required Internet service providers to get customers permission before collecting data on web-browsing and app usage. A Democratic-led FCC had approved tougher data privacy rules in mid-2016.Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR), AT&T and Verizon are the biggest internet providers. Pacific Crest Securities says internet providers will be better-positioned for targeted advertising, much like internet companies.""The ability to collect data could compel (internet providers), particularly AT&T and Verizon, to more aggressively push their (video streaming) efforts in the hope of capturing more consumer share, which would create more opportunities to sell targeted 30-second video ads,"" Andy Hargreaves, a Pacific Crest analyst, said in a note to clients.Verizon is readying a new video streaming service, Bloomberg reported last week. Comcast has reportedly acquired rights from cable network owners to offer their channels nationwide. AT&T launched its DirecTV Now online streaming service in late November.""We view the repeal of the FCC's pending Internet Privacy Order as positive for wireless ISPs, modestly positive for cable companies and neutral for Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Facebook (FB),"" added Hargreaves. ""The new policy will improve ISPs' ability to target, which should help them monetize content, but will still meaningfully lag the breadth and depth of profiling data captured by Google and Facebook's logged-in experiences.""IBD'S TAKE: Comcast stock shot up after President Trump's surprise election in November on expectations of lighter broadband regulation. Comcast stock has been consolidating more recently and has a buy point of 38.54.  Learn more about Comcast's growing institutional ownership and earnings growth at IBD Stock Checkup.Pay-TV providers such as AT&T, which acquired satellite broadcaster DirecTV Group in 2015, and Dish Network (DISH) have had an easier time obtaining streaming rights than industry outsiders, such as Apple (AAPL).Google-parent Alphabet in March announced YouTube TV, a $35 monthly paid subscription service. It's expected to launch this spring.Hulu — a joint venture of Walt Disney (DIS), Fox-parent 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA) and Comcast's NBCUniversal — is set to launch yet another live TV streaming service.The Pacific Crest Securities analyst also says internet providers have more reason to acquire content. AT&T in October agreed to buy Time Warner (TWX) for $85 billion. That deal needs to be approved by the Trump administration.""Most major ISPs already own significant content assets; however, this (data privacy rules) could compel them to purchase more content, particularly on the digital side, where the improved data is likely to have the most immediately useful value for targeting,"" wrote Hargreaves.RELATED:Google Advertising Plans Key In YouTube TV Launch Vs.

450,CHTR,"XWith Q1 earnings season kicking into high gear, it's time to build and update your watch list. Below is a look at stocks like T-Mobile (TMUS), Charter Communications (CMTR) and Chinese internet stock Weibo (WB) that expect 50% or higher EPS growth and are in or near a potential buy zone.To make the list, each stock must also trade over 200,000 shares per day and have a 90 or higher Composite Rating, meaning it's in the top 10% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.When this story was first published on Apr. 5, Alibaba (BABA) was on the list, with analysts calling for 51% earnings growth when it reports May 3. But the Chinese internet giant has now climbed above a proper buy zone.Tesla (TSLA) was also on the original list with a 52% EPS growth estimate, but closed Thursday just beyond the buy zone that extended to 301.87.Investment firm Apollo Global Management (APO), which held the No. 2 spot on the list with expected earnings growth of 395%, has also now moved beyond a proper buying range.Louisiana Pacific (LPX), Mastec (MTZ) and Western Digital[ticker symb=WDC] also closed Thursday trading just within their respective buy zones.Boosted by two quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, Cirrus Logic (CRUS) has been testing a 64.26 buy point in a first-stage cup, with its relative strength line floating near new high territory.TTM Technologies (TTMI), a contract manufacturer of printed circuit boards, rose nearly 9% on Apr. 4 in heavy volume after getting an upgrade from neutral to overweight from JPMorgan Chase (JPM).TTM has since pulled back and is trying to recapture its 50-day moving average as it works on a second-stage consolidation.The Costa Mesa, Calif.-based company has posted 71% average EPS growth over the last three quarters.The ""trick"" to making money during earnings season is to be prepared with an up-to-date watch list and action plan. When a company delivers an earnings surprise and breaks out, you want to be there, ready to pounce.But keep in mind that disappointing numbers can trigger a sudden and sharp decline, which makes it risky to buy stocks just before they report.So use screens like the one below, as well as any custom screens you create during MarketSmith open access week, as idea generators that identify stocks to watch as we head into the Q1 earnings season.Also be sure to run all your stocks through a buying checklist before you invest, use sound buy and sell rules and check overall market conditions.Stocks Nears A Buy Point And Expecting 50% Or Higher Q1 Earnings Growth

452,CHTR,"A Deutsche Bank analyst on Thursday downgraded shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS) and jumped off the telecom mergers-and-acquisitions bandwagon.There's ""limited incremental upside from M&A scenarios, which have been well-telegraphed and reflected in current valuations,"" Matthew Niknam, analyst for Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients.Niknam downgraded T-Mobile to hold from buy. The Deutsche Bank analyst does not expect a near-term acquisition of T-Mobile by cable-TV firms, such as Comcast (CMCSA) or Charter Communications (CHTR). Comcast on Thursday disclosed more of its wireless strategy.Niknam says upside from a possible Sprint (S) merger may also be limited.""We believe the current valuation more fully reflects the upside from a potential transaction with Sprint, especially considering the high-risk nature of the deal actually closing,"" Niknam added. ""If (or when) a proposed deal is announced, we believe shares are likely to trade at a sizable discount to the bid price initially similar to (AT&T's (T) proposed acquisition of Time Warner (TWX) in October).""T-Mobile stock fell 0.4% to close at 63.24 on the stock market today.T-Mobile has been gaining revenue and subscriber share vs. AT&T and Verizon Communications (VZ) for three years with its ""Uncarrier""-branded advertising. However, a few analysts have lowered first-quarter estimates amid intensified competition.""Q1 was not a pleasant quarter for U.S. wireless, and we don't think T-Mobile is immune to industry headwinds,"" added Niknam.IBD'S TAKE:  T-Mobile stock jumped after Donald Trump's unexpected victory in November's presidential election on views that a Sprint merger would be more doable.  T-Mobile stock recently has been consolidating, with a buy point of 65.51.

460,CHTR,"TV broadcasters and wireless phone companies are in store for a “spectrum extravaganza,” says FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, but others question whether the upcoming government airwaves auction will live up that billing.The Federal Communications Commission plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29. The auction, which could last as long as five months, will free up an estimated 60 megahertz to 80 MHz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum owned by local TV broadcasters.Wireless firms and other companies can file as bidders from Tuesday through Feb. 9.TV broadcasters need to be persuaded to relinquish their airwaves. The FCC has set opening prices in hundreds of markets, but bidders likely will end up paying less, under the auction’s complex structure.The deadline for broadcasters to file as auction participants was Jan. 12; the FCC has not said how many local TV stations, out of roughly 2,000 eligible nationwide, filed.The National Association of Broadcasters says it expects “robust” participation by local TV broadcasters. The rub, points out William Bird, an analyst at FBR & Co., is that broadcasters could walk away at any point.“There is little risk to participating since broadcasters may drop out of the bidding in any round if they decide the prices are too low,” he said in a research report.Paul de Sa, an analyst at Bernstein Research, says it’s still unclear “how much spectrum will ultimately be auctioned.” Broadcasters have 120 MHz in all.In the wireless industry, AT&T (T)  and Verizon Communications (VZ) more than 70% of low-frequency airwaves in the top 100 U.S. markets. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and also through walls, improving in-building services.The auction is an opportunity for smaller T-Mobile US (TMUS) to grab what Wheeler calls “beachfront spectrum.” Sprint (S) has said it will not bid, but parent SoftBank might, some analysts say.Observers speculate cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA) will bid for airwaves, most likely in local markets where it sells cable services, and perhaps an Internet giant such as Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google.The last spectrum auction, AWS-3, ended in January 2015, and it raised $41 billion. The TV broadcast auction will have trouble matching that total, analysts say, unless dark horses such as Comcast emerge.“Without non-traditional bidders, the auction results are likely to disappoint broadcasters,” said a Moody's Investors Service research report.Analysts at Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Jefferies and Deutsche Bank have estimated Comcast could spend $4 billion to $6 billion in the auction. On the other hand, Charter Communications (CHTR), which is seeking regulatory approval to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks to become the No. 2 cable firm, is not likely to bid, analysts say.Both AT&T and Verizon have talked down their interest in the broadcast airwaves.
"
461,CHTR,"Verizon CFO Fran Shammo in October told analysts Verizon isn’t sure the TV broadcasters’ 600 MHz spectrum is a good fit with Verizon’s 700 MHz footprint because of potential interference issues.John Donovan, AT&T’s senior executive of technology, at a Citigroup conference in January said the low-band, 600 MHz spectrum might be better suited for rural areas than urban markets.These comments might just be pre-auction posturing, some analysts say. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates both AT&T and Verizon could spend at least $10 billion in the auction.The FCC, meanwhile, plans to set aside a large chunk of spectrum that AT&T and Verizon cannot bid for, a policy the agency says is aimed at fostering competition.Some 30 MHz of spectrum would be set aside for smaller carriers, if at least 70 MHz is put up for bid overall.The FCC’s Wheeler expects lots of action. At the consumer electronics show, CES, in early January, he said, “I think it is safe to say that you are going to see a spectrum extravaganza — that you are going to see lots of interest in selling the spectrum and lots of interest in buying the spectrum, and that is going to be transformational.”There’s disagreement over when the sold spectrum would be available for wireless firms. AT&T says not until 2020. T-Mobile says as soon as 2018 in many cases, because local TV stations will want to get paid.T-Mobile says it could spend up to $10 billion in the auction.The exact number of frequency blocks and licenses to be auctioned will not be set until broadcasters state their intentions. The FCC plans to take a patchwork of vacant TV channels in local markets and create tighter blocks of spectrum for wireless firms to use — a process called “repacking.”While local TV stations have the option of vacating all their airwaves and thus going off the air, most are expected to move to a new frequency band or share spectrum. Opening prices are meant to persuade TV stations to part with airwaves. Telemundo’s UHF station in the New York City market has the highest opening price, at more than $900 million.Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar, in a report, forecasts that more airwaves will come from independent TV stations rather than local stations owned and operated by the four major broadcasters — Walt Disney’s (DIS) ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC.Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) and CBS (CBS) are expected to sell airwaves in some markets. While Comcast’s cable company is a potential bidder, it also owns media firm NBCUniversal, a potential seller of airwaves.
"
462,CHTR,"Smaller local TV station owners include Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) and Gray Television (GTNA).“On the supply side, we foresee potential robust participation from the major broadcasters, excluding ABC,” Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh wrote in a recent research note. “Sinclair, Media General (MEG) and Tribune Media have clearly vocalized their interest in the auction.“Nexstar (NXST), E.W. Scripps, and Entravision (EVC) have been less vocal on their strategy, and Meredith has stated it doesn’t believe a material opportunity exists for its footprint.”While other wireless carriers were little changed in the stock market Monday, Sprint plunged 12.2% to 2.52, ahead of its Tuesday-morning earnings report. The company has axed at least 2,500 jobs in customer care centers and at its headquarters since last fall, the Associated Press said in a Monday-afternoon report. Last week Sprint notified employees at six customer service centers around the country that it would be closing those locations or reducing the staff there, AP reported.

465,CHTR,"Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and other cable TV firms are becoming broadband-first companies as they take away internet customers of AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ).The top cable companies added 3.3 million broadband subscribers in 2016 — similar to the gains in 2015, and the most net additions in any year since 2007, says Leichtman Research Group. Cable TV firms, meanwhile, lost 278,000 pay-TV video subscribers in 2016, although Comcast added 161,000.Comcast had 24.7 million broadband subscribers vs. 22.5 million video customers at the end of 2016. The broadband gap is wider at Charter, which acquired Time Warner Cable. Charter had 22.59 million broadband subscribers vs. 17.2 million video subscribers as of Dec. 31.The top cable TV firms followed by LRG had 58.4 million broadband subscribers vs. 48.6 million video subscribers at the end of 2016. Top telephone companies — including AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink (CTL) — had 34.5 million broadband subscribers, down 599,000 from a year earlier. In 2015, phone companies lost 185,000 broadband subscribers, says LRG.With more internet video services rolling out in 2017 and next year, pay-TV industry subscribers could fall further, analysts say. As cord-cutting goes on and the traditional video business for cable providers shrinks, their No. 1 product will be broadband and internet access. So even if internet video takes off, they still have broadband dominance.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon and AT&T have been favorites of investors looking for high dividends, but there are other options, such as banks, industrials and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Check out IBD's Income Investor for high-dividend-paying stocksGoogle-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) has announced YouTube TV, a $35 monthly paid subscription service.

466,CHTR,"Telecom investors waiting for big names in the industry to formally recite their nuptials and merge within the next several months may find themselves woefully disappointed.Expectations have run high among telecom stock holders that spring will bring a new round of negotiations designed to bring wireless, cable TV and phone companies to the bargaining table. Within weeks, a government radio spectrum auction is expected to end, thus freeing up companies to negotiate a deal.Analysts warn, however, that while investors might want to play the proverbial meddling parent, telecom giants can't be prodded into taking vows. Further, an unpredictable Trump administration is creating an uncertain regulatory picture for the sector.""Expectations that a wave of M&A will happen quickly may be misplaced,"" said Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson.""Just because the deal window will be open again doesn't mean everyone will rush to the altar,"" Moffett said. ""I call it the beer goggles trade. Everyone thinks that every deal that can happen will happen — and soon — so much of this is already priced into the stocks. There's real risk that the M&A wave doesn't happen, or at least not right away.""The radio spectrum auction that's expected to end in April, could set up 2017 to be one of the most dramatic years in terms of reshaping the telecom sector. The FCC's auction mandates that any potential bidders put a freeze on any possible strategic moves until the process concludes.Meanwhile, shares in Sprint (S), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Dish Network (DISH) trade at levels that figure on mergers and acquisitions happening. Speculation that Dow component Verizon Communications (VZ), Comcast (CMCSA) or Charter Communications (CHTR) will be potential buyers runs hot.Most of the merger talk revolves around T-Mobile, controlled by Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY). It has a number of potential suitors, and overall has the most options.""T-Mobile is probably the belle of the ball,"" Moffett said.Federal regulators blocked AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, saying a market structure with four national players would benefit consumers. Since 2014, T-Mobile has been growing subscribers and is the only carrier with significant service-revenue growth.But even with T-Mobile, great expectations could be dashed. Its business is humming, and so T-Mobile may prefer no deal at all near-term. And, cable companies Comcast and Charter — considered prime T-Mobile suitors — may not be ready to pull the trigger on a wireless acquisition.Roger Entner, head of Recon Analytics, told IBD: ""The problem with U.S. telecom mergers is that there are a lot more sellers than buyers.""Further, the Trump administration looms as a wild card. There are expectations for laissez-faire regulation in the new administration that could fuel mergers, but President Trump has yet to propose tax reform legislation.Some changes, such as a lower corporate tax rate, could boost telecom firms. Analysts say, though, there's a good possibility the Republican-controlled Congress will end or limit interest-expense deductions on corporate debt. In return, businesses would get tax credits that would encourage business investment.IBD'S TAKE: There's another good reason T-Mobile is so desirable; it has the top ranking of all companies in IBD's Telecom Services-Wireless Group. It has a Composite Rating of 88, meaning it outranks 88% of all companies. For more, do a stock checkup on T-Mobile.Ending ""net interest deductibility"" would make debt-financed acquisitions less attractive. If buyers issue new stock to pull off deals, that would dilute the equity of existing shareholders.That means companies may stay on the sidelines until Trump's tax reform is enacted.""The potential for tax reform could pause M&A in the near term,"" said a Goldman Sachs report. Private equity firms would also be affected.A regulatory bellwether could surface this year when the Trump administration decides on AT&T's (T) planned $85 billion purchase of media giant Time Warner (TWX). Potentially one of 2017's game changers, AT&T aims to combine Time Warner's content with its national wireless network and satellite broadcaster DirecTV.While AT&T says its purchase of Time Warner would be good for competition and consumers, the rub for telecom investors is that most deals would not ease a wireless price war.""Among possible combinations, only a merger of Sprint and T-Mobile would reduce competitive pressure,"" said a Moody's Investor Service report in March. That, however, also comes with stumbling blocks.Regulators signaled opposition to a Sprint and T-Mobile merging three years ago, leading SoftBank (SFTBY) and Deutsche Telekom to shelve talks. SoftBank owns 83% of Sprint, while Deutsche Telekom owns two-thirds of T-Mobile.SoftBank founder and Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, who recently formed a $100 billion investment fund, has promised to help create U.S. jobs, aiming to build up relations with President Trump.Son in February also signaled that he would be willing to let Deutsche Telekom hold a controlling stake if T-Mobile and Sprint combined. The reason is that debt-laden SoftBank and Sprint may not be able to afford T-Mobile anymore. Its market valuation has shot up to $50.6 billion.""(Son) has recently suggested any and everything is on the table regarding M&A and that T-Mobile isn't the only option, which some investors may have read as less likelihood of a deal,"" said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co.Market-share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint pressured AT&T and Verizon recently to reintroduce unlimited wireless-data plans, a boost for consumers. Both T-Mobile and Sprint, meanwhile, are doing better financially. So even in a Trump administration, approval of a their merger would not be a slam dunk.""The rank and file of the (Justice Department) feels vindicated in blocking the AT&T/T-Mobile merger and would want to preserve T-Mobile's status as a maverick in the industry,"" said the RBC Capital report in February.A Dish Network merger with T-Mobile, on the other hand, would combine two discount-oriented marketing machines.Dish Network has cobbled together nearly 80 MHz of midband spectrum that T-Mobile could use to boost network quality.That also faces high hurdles, though. A Dish acquisition would need to be structured to deal with Charles Ergen, the satellite TV broadcaster's co-founder and chairman, who controls the company's voting shares. It's unlikely that Ergen wants to cash out, analysts say.Either way, Deutsche Telekom relishes having a kingmaker strategy in U.S. consolidation.""Are we a seller or buyer? It always depends on the quality of the possibilities,"" Deutsche CEO Tim Hoettges said in a news conference on March 2.T-Mobile CEO John Legere has talked up the possibility of cable partners on its earnings calls.Partnerships between cable TV and wireless companies have picked up in Europe, although John Malone-controlled Liberty Global (LBTYA) and U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD) backed away from a full-blown merger.Some analysts speculate that Deutsche Telekom's preference would be selling T-Mobile to Comcast or Charter, or both, while retaining a minority stake.""Comcast and Charter remain the most likely suitors,"" said Oppenheimer's Tim Horan.Charter and Comcast have an agreement, though, to lease access to Verizon's wireless network on a wholesale basis. Comcast plans to launch wireless services in mid-2017.Analysts who follow the cable TV firms say those companies are in no rush to buy a wireless firm outright and could expand the Verizon relationship.""Commentary from Comcast, Charter, and Liberty Broadband point to a strictly organic growth strategy in wireless utilizing Wi-Fi and (wholesale) agreements to achieve scale, at least for the next couple of years,"" said Bryan Kraft, a Deutsche Bank analyst in a report.While telecom investors expect M&A to break out in 2017, ""The timing of acquisitions remains in the hands of the buyers,"" said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG Research, in an email.RELATED: Disney A Cure For Verizon Woes?

""We continue to believe a Sprint/T-Mo deal is likely given the benefits of moving from 4 to 3 players and the significant synergies it would create,"" added Hodulik.Verizon last month reintroduced unlimited data plans amid market share gains by T-Mobile and Sprint, which aggressively pushed unlimited promotions in late 2016.One view among analysts is that the proliferation of unlimited-data offers among wireless firms could make it harder for cable TV firms Comcast  (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) to break into the wireless business. The cable TV firms hold rights to lease access to Verizon's network on a wholesale basis, under a so-called mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, deal.Shares in T-Mobile climbed 1.3% to 63.27 at the close on the stock market today.RELATED:Sprint Could Sell To T-Mobile, But Dish Network LoomsVerizon, Comcast Merger Talk A 'Nonstarter,' Says JPMorgan

470,CHTR,"The Federal Communications Commission will return to ""light-touch"" regulation to maximize investments in broadband, Chairman Ajit Pai said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Tuesday.""Our approach will be not zero regulation but light-touch regulation,"" Pai said at the annual industry event. The agency will focus on making regulatory decisions that foster competition, he said.Pai, a Republican on the agency since 2012, was elevated in January by President Donald Trump. When asked if he as Trump's appointee can act independently, Pai said he's not trying to be a political actor, but a regulator making decisions based on well-established processes and facts.Pai may soon have to make decisions on further consolidation in the U.S., where SoftBank Group (SFTBY) founder Masayoshi Son is said to be open to handing control of Sprint (S) to T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS), a unit of Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), in a deal that would reduce the number of major U.S. carriers to three from four.In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday, Pai wouldn't go into specifics on Sprint and T-Mobile, saying he hadn't been presented with documents.Asked whether the U.S. wireless market would still be competitive with three providers, Pai said that while he can't say what the optimal market structure is, ""the current wireless marketplace in the U.S. is extremely competitive."" If a deal is in the public interest, ""then we would be more favorably inclined to approve a deal,"" Pai said.Among his initial actions, Pai is moving to ease requirements imposed when the agency approved Charter Communications' (CHTR) acquisition of Time Warner Cable (TWC) last year — an action that could signal loosening of other mandates as well.Pai also voted against the net neutrality measure passed by the FCC in 2015. It survived a court challenge last year, but opponents are vowing to reverse or rescind it.Pai said Tuesday that the FCC is considering what framework would work best to protect both the FCC's principles and the need for investment. He also signaled his support for unlimited data plans offered by wireless carriers in the U.S., calling them a ""great thing for consumers.""In a Feb. 10 interview, Pai said he opposes adding ""extraneous conditions"" on media and telecommunications companies seeking to merge.

Cities will likely challenge any FCC limits on fees, says the Cowen report.""We think Chairman Pai will now pivot to the ground game — lowering local barriers for small-cell deployment,"" said the Cowen & Co. report. ""An aggressive FCC ruling has the potential to materially bend the cost curve of 5G deployment.""Verizon is testing 5G services in 11 U.S. cities and has stated plans for a ""meaningful"" commercial deployment of 5G broadband services in 2018. Verizon has targeted data speeds of 1 gigabit per second, roughly 20 times average cable broadband speeds to homes. In addition to wireless small-cell radio antennas, the 5G networks will require fiber-optic connections to telecom networks.Cowen & Co. says there's potential upside for Crown Castle (CCI), a cell-tower operator that has invested in small-cell technology, as well as Zayo Holdings (ZAYO) in 5G deployment. Zayo provides fiber-optic connections to telecom networks.IBD'S TAKE: Seacoast Banking, Western Alliance Bancorporation, Broadcom and Inphi are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors.

Instead, they've told investors they're well-positioned to partner with phone companies in 5G deployment, owing to their extensive fiber-optic wiring in local neighborhoods.It's unclear, though, whether a Verizon-cable 5G partnership would target self-driving cars or other emerging applications.Verizon shares rose 0.2% on the stock market today, while Verizon climbed 0.4%.

472,CHTR,"Dish Network (DISH) stock jumped on Tuesday, a day after the satellite TV broadcaster was added to the S&P 500, opening the door to more institutional investment.Dish Network stock ended the trading day up 4.5% to 64 on the stock market today. The stock has been consolidating amid expectations that telecom industry merger negotiations may pick up after a government auction of wireless spectrum ends in April. Dish Network has cobbled together nearly 80 MHz of spectrum but has been unable to partner with a wireless phone company to launch mobile video services.Dish Network will join the S&P 500 cable and satellite subindustry index, joining the likes of Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR).

473,CHTR,"Verizon Communications' (VZ) new advertising message — unlimited data along with the ""best wireless network"" — is jelling with customers amid an industry price war, an analyst said Monday.Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, noted in a report to clients that AT&T (T) and Verizon last month reintroduced unlimited data plans amid market share gains by T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S), which aggressively pushed promotions in late 2016. While rivals offer standard-quality video in unlimited data promotions, Verizon's advertising plays up its ability to deliver high-definition quality video.Further, Verizon's retail stores are reporting higher consumer traffic, Moffett says.""Verizon has seemingly found a path forward in what many have concluded is an irreparably commoditized wireless industry,"" Moffett said. ""Verizon is convinced that there is still room for network differentiation, and that offering full HD unlimited video will showcase not network deficiency, but instead will underscore its network advantage.""Moffett has a buy rating on Verizon stock. He rates T-Mobile neutral on valuation. Moffett has sell ratings on AT&T and Sprint.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Inphi and Mobileye are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Amid a down day for stocks, Verizon shares edged down 6 cents to 50.03 at the close on the stock market today. Shares in AT&T slipped 5 cents to 41.96. Meanwhile, Sprint stock lost 1.4% to 8.78 as T-Mobile stock was off 1.1% to 62.84.Verizon stock has been trading below its 50-day and 200-day lines while Sprint stock has weakened after touching a 32-month high of 9.65 last month. T-Mobile has retreated from a record high of 63.68 on Feb. 17.Moffett says T-Mobile is ""committed to network-based competition"" while AT&T is more focused on content. AT&T is seeking Trump administration approval to acquire media giant Time Warner (TWX).Moffett says Verizon may be able to increase ARPU (average monthly revenue per subscriber) with its unlimited data strategy. ARPU has been falling industrywide.One view among analysts is that the proliferation of unlimited-data offers among wireless firms could make it harder for cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) to break into the wireless business. The cable TV firms hold rights to lease access to Verizon's network on a wholesale basis, under a so-called ""MVNO"" deal.RELATED:Sprint Could Sell To T-Mobile, But Dish Network LoomsVerizon, Comcast Merger Talk A 'Nonstarter,' Says JPMorgan

""Cable industry residential revenues have grown almost 200% since video subs peaked. We believe Internet gross margins are now twice that of video gross margins and expect them to remain very high as customers buy faster data tiers.

524,CHTR,"When Brandon Schatz learned in December 2012 that Kansas City, Kan., had become the first city in the nation to get Google Fiber, a superfast internet service, he started making plans to move his nascent sports photography business there. The day after Christmas, he drove the 165 miles from his home in Springfield, Mo., to check it out. By Feb. 1, he had settled into his new house. By Feb. 4, he was connected to the network. That was exactly what officials had wanted. When the area (first Kansas City, Kan., with Kansas City, Mo., added weeks later) won a challenge to be the first to get Google Fiber, local boosters celebrated, hoping to kick-start an economic renaissance: attracting entrepreneurs, cultivating emerging business districts, and becoming known as a major startup hub.Four years later, Schatz's company Sportsphotos.com, which takes photos of amateur sporting events around the country, is growing slowly. He's taking full advantage of the speedy internet, uploading hundreds of high-resolution photos in minutes from races and other matches. But the business isn't yet where he wants it to be, and for now Schatz's main source of income is web development work and renting out rooms in his home on Airbnb. On a recent Sunday, Schatz sat in his home, where he also operates his company, pecking away at a desktop, surrounded by pizza boxes. ""I thought we would be huge already,"" he said.Schatz's disappointment is a tale of misplaced expectations, by both entrepreneurs and city leaders. In 2011 the cities' two mayors called Fiber's then-future deployment ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" and a way to ""spark economic development."" And for Google, which since significantly has pared down support for the project, it was a case of placing too much faith in the ability of its own technology to change lives.It's also been hard for the Kansas City area to become the boom town that leaders dreamed of. Some entrepreneurs, like Schatz, were drawn to the city because of the fiber, and some launched businesses. A ""startup village"" sprang up. But few of the companies really took off, and some frustrated founders ended up decamping to San Francisco, where there was a larger talent pool and greater access to capital. Even the best of intentions and superspeedy internet isn't enough to create a new Silicon Valley.Every year after the first fiber connections lit up for Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in late 2012, greater Kansas City's GDP growth has fallen well short of the national average. In 2015, it was just 1.5%, compared to 2.6% for the nation as a whole. Metro regional numbers aren't yet available for all of 2016, although based on state numbers through the third quarter, both Kansas and Missouri seem to be beating the national average.""We're scratching our heads a little bit,"" said Jeff Pinkerton of the Mid America Regional Council, a nonprofit that conducts economic research for greater Kansas City. ""Why is Kansas City really not taking off, especially with this asset like Google Fiber?""Google came to town in 2011. At Wyandotte High School auditorium, on the Kansas side, blue, red, yellow and green spotlights shone on a parade of dignitaries who addressed the audience. Google founder Sergey Brin spoke on a prerecorded video. After the announcement about fiber going into Kansas City, a Google vice president invited the crowd to a barbecue-laden celebration.Kansas City beat out more than 1,000 other cities for the debut Google fiber project, which aimed to compete against the telecommunications and cable giants that have dominated the market for internet access. Some analysts believed the ultimate goal was to encourage those competitors to improve their own services and thus the internet experience overall, which would bolster the environment for Alphabet's most lucrative business: online search.Mayors of both cities announced a team of civic leaders to figure out how best to leverage fiber, in entrepreneurship as well as other areas such as education. The group released a plan in 2012 that made recommendations ranging from nurturing technology districts to supporting tax credits for small technology businesses to creating mentor networks.Despite budget challenges, the state of Kansas has stuck by a pre-existing income tax credit of up to $50,000 for angel backers who invest in a young company. Working with a group called Techstars, Kansas City-based Sprint (S) created an incubator for startups. The Kauffman Foundation, a think tank based in Kansas City, Mo., started a weekly gathering for entrepreneurs.An area straddling State Line Road, the border, became the first neighborhood that Google wired for fiber, and a community of founders sprang up. The district, which had zoning laws that made it easier to run a business from home, became known as Startup Village. That's where Schatz, the owner of Sportsphotos.com, moved into a rental house.It was an online video about the Kansas City experiment that drew him. He realized that Google Fiber could be the key to his nascent business: Batches of photos that took 40 to 50 hours to upload would be done in less than one. ""It's a little nerdy, to see this video and be all kinds of inspired,"" says Schatz, 34, a boyish looking former U.S. Army sergeant whose tours of duty included Bosnia. ""But I was inspired.""Yet in practice, a dazzling internet connection didn't mean much for some businesses. Mike Farmer operated his startup, Leap, a search engine, out of a Startup Village house for a while. ""What do you do with gigabit speed that makes the experience more relevant?"" he recalls asking his team. They goofed around with ideas, such as having search results take the form of several high-definition Netflix movies streaming at the same time. Given that most users wouldn't have gigabit internet, Leap never did find the right scenario. Farmer wound down the business last year.""The true power of Google fiber is exposure,"" says Matthew Marcus, executive director of the Kansas City Startup Foundation and co-leader of the Startup Village, referring to the publicity the technology brought to the city's startup community. ""The fact is, it's really difficult to consume one gigabit of speed.""Some startups have contended with the lack of access to a big talent pool. Tech companies in Silicon Valley, Waterloo, Canada, and New York City, tend to hire from nearby universities with strong software-engineering programs. The schools with the strongest engineering schools in the region are more than two hours away from Kansas City, though.Funding has also been a problem in Kansas City. Entrepreneurs lamented that local investors looked for the type of traction that would merit tens of millions of dollars from Silicon Valley venture firms. But if businesses achieve that, Midwestern venture firms invest just single-digit millions. Lack of access to capital contributed to the departure of two promising Kansas City startups, bond marketplace Neighborly and green-homebuilder Acre, which both moved most operations to Silicon Valley.""There are plenty of angels that will write $50,000 checks, but there's not that much bridge,"" says Sandy Kemper, chief executive officer of Fairway, Kansas-based C2FO, a working-capital finance company he founded in 2008. Kemper turned to big investors outside Kansas City, including San Francisco's Mithril Capital and Singapore's Temasek Holdings, for most of his backing. In his hometown, ""there is a finer filter, and maybe a little bit higher hurdle.""One advantage cited by many local entrepreneurs, low costs, can actually backfire. ""It might be a misplaced sense of comfort,"" says Ajay Royan, the general partner at Mithril Capital who invested in C2FO. He believes the best entrepreneurs work with an intensity driven by the reality of global competition — a reality too easily lost sight of in a low-pressure, low-cost environment. ""If you get comfortable with the fact that things seem to be going well in Kansas City,"" he says, and don't think beyond it, ""that's bad.""C2FO is one many other entrepreneurs hope will eventually list on a public market and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, with a valuation north of a billion. It has already raised $99 million and is used by some of the world's biggest companies, including Acer, Costco (COST), Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) BNSF Railway, and Pfizer (PFE). That type of public offering, more than anything, would truly foster entrepreneurship in Kansas City, entrepreneurs say. It would show existing investors the upside of investing more than a few thousand dollars in startups, along with creating a class of richly rewarded early employees who would in turn likely become investors in other startups — or founders of their own.Lance LeMay, a venture capitalist at Kansas City, Mo.-based Open Air Equity Partners who invested in Kemper's and Farmer's companies, said boosting the venture-backed startup ecosystem in Kansas City won't even take that much. ""More than a billion-dollar exit, you need lots of successful exits,"" he said. ""You don't need a home run. You need lots of doubles.""In the years that Kansas City has been trying to make the most out of Fiber, Google has been doing the same. In early days, company executives talked it up, with executive chairman Eric Schmidt telling conference goers in late 2012 that of all the company's current innovations, including self-driving cars, it was Google's ""most compelling on many levels,"" something that ""changes your life."" Shortly afterward, it started announcing more cities for the project, beginning with Austin, Texas, and Provo, Utah. In 2013, the company recruited Craig Barratt, a wireless chip industry veteran, to lead the group that included Fiber. In 2015, when Google became Alphabet, Barratt was given the title of CEO. Over time, Google Fiber announced it would expand into 21 cities.But just as Kansas City might have overestimated the asset that Google Fiber could become, Google overestimated Fiber's impact, and its expansion plans deflated. Barratt left in October 2016, surprising many employees. The same day, the unit announced it was stalling expansion plans in eight cities and cutting 9% of its staff. This month, Alphabet hired Barratt's replacement, broadband executive Gregory McCray, and further slimmed Fiber, shifting hundreds of its employees over to Google's core internet business.Fiber is now in only nine locations, including Atlanta and Orange County, Calif. Other Bets, the part of Alphabet that Google Fiber belongs to, reported losses of $3.58 billion last year on revenue of $809 million. It also contributed to Other Bets' $1.39 billion in capital expenditures.A number of factors lay behind Fiber's strategic shift. Former employees said a chief reason was the discrepancy between the desires of Google's co-founders to expand the service and make it faster and the demanding costs of providing it. Cable incumbents moved aggressively, introducing similar high-speed services at low prices. Unexpected political hurdles emerged. In Louisville, Ky., for instance, AT&T (T) and Charter Communications (CHTR) sued Google Fiber over a wonky utility-bill regulation.""Google invested in Fiber during a time when it was willing to make lots of big investments with uncertain or long-term returns, but over the last couple of years Google has become a different place,"" says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. ""It doesn't necessarily make sense for Alphabet to continue to invest in it as heavily at this point.""Schatz recently changed his business model. Instead of getting amateur athletes to pay for the photos, they download them for free, with sponsorship fees providing his revenue. Having observed the reluctance of local investors to back companies that lack strong income, he is working to build relationships with big sports retailers and fitness companies that could sponsor the blanket photography of the events he shoots.The race-photography business alone is worth $20 million to $50 million annually a year on sponsorships, he calculates; add in other amateur sports and expanded marketing initiatives and it could be exponentially more. But for now, he's capturing just a tiny portion; revenue last year doubled but was still under $100,000, he says. This year, he hopes to keep growing and achieve profitability.He knows developing ties to potential sponsors would be much easier in a city like New York or Los Angeles, but he believes he can pull it off from the heartland.Sometimes, he thinks back to advice a venture capitalist gave him a few years ago, to drop everything else and focus only on his business. The laid-back atmosphere in Kansas City made it easier to put that advice aside, he says.""It probably would have been good to have extra pressure,"" he says now. Still, he says perks such as a community of fellow entrepreneurs make him happy he stayed put.Meanwhile, some of the original startup supporters in Startup Village have sold their real estate to non-entrepreneurs.After Google Fiber came to town, Brad Feld, a venture capitalist at Boulder, Colo.-based Foundry Group bought a bungalow in Startup Village for use, gratis, by a promising young company. For a time, Leap's Farmer housed interns there. Today, a startup engineer lives in the house. On a recent visit, a layer of dark fuzz and grime obscured floors. A vacuum cleaner stood at the far end of the main room, plugged in but apparently unused. A side room lacked furniture, but did sport a large pile of clothing flung in its center. A skittish cat bolted across the kitchen.Three doors down the street, Schatz has decided to launch an intense search for financial backers.

We would be hard pressed to imagine that John Malone would be willing to trade Charter for Verizon without a very large premium indeed.""Verizon bought out Vodafone Group's (VOD) 45% interest in their wireless joint venture, Verizon Wireless, for $130 billion in 2014.At Jefferies, analyst Mike McCormack says a Verizon-Charter deal lacks near-term synergies.""Reports of a Verizon-Charter deal are counter to Verizon's mobile first strategy,"" said McCormack. ""Most point to 5G (wireless) as the rationale, though we don't see Charter as providing the ideal geographies or technology platform for such a deployment.""Simon Flannery, analyst at Morgan Stanley, is in the same camp.""The benefit of a potential Charter acquisition to Verizon's 5G plans as it relates to fixed wireless is unclear,"" said Flannery. ""While bringing Charter's fiber network in-house adds to Verizon's backhaul capacity, 5G fixed wireless is intended to be a competitor to cable broadband, the primary earnings driver for Charter. Acquiring Charter and then deploying a fixed wireless competitor to Charter's broadband service would be counterintuitive.""At Deutsche Bank, analyst Bryan Kraft says some investors are wondering whether media leaks over a Verizon-Charter deal are aimed at bringing Dish to the bargaining table. Dish owns 78 MHz of mid-band radio spectrum but needs a partner to make use of that spectrum.Verizon may be trying to ""flush out another potential target,"" speculated Kraft.RELATED:Disney A Cure For Verizon Woes?

Losers were Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX), PayPal (PYPL) and Proofpoint (PFPT).During regular trading, homebuilders were on the move again, helped by strong earnings from PulteGroup (PHM).

All three are near buy points.In the airline group, Southwest Airlines (LUV) gapped up to an all-time high, soaring 9% to 53.92. It's extended from a 48.10 buy point.

531,CHTR,"Verizon Communications (VZ) and media baron John Malone's Charter Communications (CHTR) are exploring a merger, according to multiple reports Thursday.Media baron Malone's Liberty Broadband (LBRDA) is the biggest shareholder in Charter, which acquired Time Warner Cable in 2015, emerging as the No. 2 cable TV firm behind Comcast (CMCSA). Malone and Liberty Media's assets include stakes in Discovery (DISCA), Starz, QVC Group and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF). Malone is chairman of Liberty Media.In Europe, Malone-controlled cable TV firm Liberty Global (LBTYA) has forged partnerships with wireless firms such as Vodafone Group (VOD). Liberty Global and Vodafone backed away from merger talks in 2015, however. Malone, a cable TV industry pioneer, led Tele-Communications Inc. in the 1980s and 90s. The old AT&T acquired TCI in 1999, and most of its assets eventually were sold off to cable firms.Charter stock shot up 7.4% to close at 333.15 in the stock market today, at a record high for the fifth straight trading day as M&A rumors have swirled in the communications services field. Verizon shares ended 1.3% lower Thursday. Verizon stock slumped 4.4% Tuesday on disappointing 2017 guidance and is trading at two-month lows.The Wall Street Journal initially reported that Verizon had approached Charter, with the Financial Times following up by saying the companies have hired advisors for merger talks.IBD'S TAKE: Seacoast Banking, Inphi, GrubHub and NetEase are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters.Speculation over Verizon-Charter negotiations first surfaced in mid-December. Verizon's CEO Lowell McAdam told sell-side analysts in a meeting that a merger would make ""industrial sense.""Verizon also has been linked to Dish Network (DISH), which had wireless assets but needs a partner. Dish stock lost 6.8% Thursday on the Charter report.Charter and Comcast have an agreement to lease access to Verizon's wireless network on a wholesale basis. Comcast plans to launch wireless services in mid-2017.Merging with a cable TV firm would dovetail with Verizon's strategy to launch 5G wireless services. 5G services require connections to fiber-optic networks in dense urban areas.""We believe a combination of Verizon and Charter is feasible but difficult on the financials, but Comcast's overall size and NBC ownership make a deal with Verizon a nonstarter as the regulatory review process would likely be quite difficult,"" JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick wrote Monday in a broad research report on telecom industry M&A scenarios.Speaking at a Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. investor event in early January, Malone speculated that cable firms could buy T-Mobile US (TMUS). He also suggested that in a Trump administration maybe even Charter and Comcast could merge. The Obama administration blocked Comcast's purchase of Time Warner Cable in 2015.RELATED:Disney A Cure For Verizon Woes?

568,CHTR,"Speculation that Comcast (CMCSA) will sell wireless services amid an industry price war is premature, says a Jefferies analyst.

The cable companies secured rights to resell Verizon's wireless services. Verizon's CFO Fran Shammo, on the company's earnings call Tuesday, said: ""We were informed that they're going to execute on that agreement,"" sparking more speculation.Within the wireless industry, wholesale network deals are referred to as an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement.""We believe Comcast was merely preserving its right to offer service through the agreement, and see no imminent move by Comcast,"" McCormack said.Comcast and other cable companies could offer a hybrid service combining access to Wi-Fi networks as well as Verizon's network, said DSL Reports in a blog.Bloomberg also reported that Comcast is ramping up a hybrid cellular-and-Wi-Fi service.Comcast and Verizon have been at odds over renegotiating the 2011 network-leasing agreement, said a Wall Street Journal report in late July. Shammo said Tuesday that ""the agreement is the agreement.""There's been speculation that Comcast could target T-Mobile.""If, in fact, Comcast is serious about wireless, an acquisition would be the smartest move, but only if there was a belief that a three-player market was achievable.""Charter Communications (CHTR), meanwhile, is seeking federal regulators' approval to acquire Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House — two of the companies involved in the Verizon spectrum deal. Paul de Sa, analyst at Bernstein Research, says speculation over a Charter push into wireless services could make regulators more friendly to the TWC takeover.""We believe the main near-term effect of the MVNO will be to provide ammunition for advocates of the Charter/TWC/BHN transaction, allowing them to argue that deal approval will further the public interest by enabling increased mobile competition,"" said de Sa.While Verizon and Comcast appear to be at odds over terms of the MVNO, de Sa holds out the possibility of a renegotiated deal, which he called a ""non-aggression pact,"" under which Verizon would cooperate with cable TV companies.

641,CHTR,"AT&T (T) and CenturyLink (CTL) are vulnerable to further broadband market share losses vs. Comcast and other cable TV firms, says Morgan Stanley, based on customer dissatisfaction in areas where copper-based DSL broadband service is available.While cable TV firms — including Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR), Time Warner Cable (TWC) and privately held Cox Communications — already dominate the broadband market, there's still upside for them, Benjamin Swinburne, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research report.Swinburne says that cable TV firms should also target the pay TV customers of satellite broadcasters DirecTV Group and Dish Network (DISH), which currently resell DSL services from phone companies. Morgan Stanley surveyed 2,500 U.S. households during August and September on broadband and TV services.""U-verse and AT&T DSL had especially weak satisfaction results, and satellite pay-TV subscribers' broadband satisfaction fell materially year over year,"" said the Morgan Stanley report. ""For cable broadband, satellite TV households remain an opportunity.""Cable customers reported an average speed of 38 megabits per second (Mbps), while DSL subscribers said they had 21 Mbps service on average. Verizon Communications (VZ) FiOS customers on average had nearly 30 Mbps service and were happier, despite price hikes, says the Morgan Stanley report.There's also good news in the survey for media firms (Walt Disney (DIS), CBS (CBS), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Comcast-NBCUniversal) that own broadcast TV networks ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC.""Seventy-five percent of pay-TV respondents ranked the broadcast networks as one of the top three most important channel groups in their bundle. On average, only 25% of total respondents ranked any one cable network group in their top three,"" said the report.Comcast and Apple (AAPL) are expected to anchor their ""skinny"" TV bundles, programming packages with fewer channels, likely including the broadcast networks.Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

Verizon has also been promoting ""Custom TV,"" a skinny bundle of TV channels, which gives customers more leeway in selecting video entertainment.Comcast has ramped up ""X-1"" service promotions, offering gift cards and other perks. Comcast, say some analysts, could get a boost from Xfinity On Campus, a service that lets college students watch live TV and on-demand content on Internet-connected devices. Comcast has expanded the Xfinity On Campus program to more colleges this fall.Pay-TV industry losses jumped in Q2, leading to a sell-off in cable and media stocks as worries mounted over ""cord-cutting"" — the loss of traditional TV subscribers as millennials flock to Web streaming and on-demand viewing.Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant says that market research by Bandwidth Consultants indicates that pay TV companies have stepped up promotions. Cable TV companies have lowered pricing for broadband-only services in some promotions, offering higher data speeds at the same or lower prices.""We believe that in Q3, there was heavy promotional emphasis on triple-play bundling aimed at 'traditionals,' and on skinny bundles and single-play promotions aimed at millennials, that likely led to success in subscriber trends,"" said Jayant in a research report. ""We believe industry losses moderated to roughly 360,000 subscribers this quarter (Q3) from last quarter's 600,000 losses.""Year-over-year comparisons, however, will be weaker, he says.""We estimate 360,000 subscriber losses in Q3 2015, compared to 165,000 losses in Q3 2014,"" said Jayant.He expects the most improved results from Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner Cable (TWC). He's less upbeat about Charter Communications (CHTR) and Cablevision Systems (CVC), which Altice Group is acquiring.""AT&T's U-Verse and DirecTV have many moving parts — the acquisition of DirecTV being completed in early Q3 — but there was possibly a small gain in net video customers of 50,000 at DTV offset by 40,000 losses at U-Verse,"" Jayant wrote.AT&T (T) might take a charge estimated at $1.1 billion related to DirecTV's Venezuela assets related to currency woes, Reuters has reported.Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

AMC Networks reportedly is in talks to buy John Malone's premium movie channel Starz (STRZA).Altice Chairman Patrick Drahi has said Altice could target privately held Cox Communications.""Altice's entry into U.S. cable could signal more deals, including Cable One, privately held Cox and Mediacom,"" said Amy Yong, analyst at Macquarie Securities, in a report. ""This could prop up multiples in the industry but also drive up asset prices should Charter Time Warner seek additional deals.""Altice's game plan, analysts say, is gaining scale to bulk up for further takeovers. In most cases, Altice has added debt to the acquisition target to fund deals.Altice owns French cable TV operator Numericable and wireless firm SFR. In April, Altice closed a nearly $8 billion deal to buy Portugal Telecom's Portuguese assets.

737,CHTR,"He says the companies could agree to a deal of around $140 per share, lower than the $160 per share price Time Warner Cable might have been seeking but above the $125 per share he says Charter was willing to pay in June.Absent a merger between them, pressure will likely mount on Charter Communications (CHTR) and Time Warner Cable  (TWC) to improve financial results amid hefty stock gains in 2013, analysts say.Cable firm Charter's stock has jumped 68% in 2013 on speculation it will make an acquisition, probably TWC. Charter stock hit an all-time high of 144 on Oct. 30, but has since slipped to 128.Time Warner Cable stock is up 25% this year largely on expectations it will be acquired by Charter, whose biggest shareholder is Liberty Media (LMCA). Noted cable industry pioneer John Malone controls Liberty and he's pushing industry consolidation. TWC stock touched its all-time high of 128 on Nov. 1.But comments by TWC executives on the company's earnings conference call Oct. 31 have tempered merger expectations.""I don't think TWC wants to sell, but the stock is expensive with a lot of premium already baked in,"" Christopher King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, told IBD. ""Maybe at some point shareholders and the board start to put pressure on management to talk to Malone.""Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt is retiring Jan. 1. He'll remain on the board, along with incoming CEO Rob Marcus.One TWC worry about a Charter merger is that the combined company would carry heavy debt. Analysts say Charter can't do a big cash deal if it wants to remain investment grade. Charter had debt of $14.4 billion as of Sept. 30.""(TWC) management's apparent position is a significant deterrent to completion of an acquisition,"" said Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities.Nomura Securities analyst Adam Ilkowitz agrees. ""We don't believe there are clear sellers, leaving John Malone and Charter potentially left at the altar,"" he said in a research report.A deal is unlikely at current valuations, says Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson. ""The combined run-up in the shares of the two companies easily exceeds the potential synergy value of a deal,"" he wrote in a research report.Still, speculation that a merger might yet happen was fueled by disappointing Q3 operating results at Time Warner Cable. It lost 304,000 of its 11.7 million video subscribers. Its revenue and free cash flow missed analyst estimates.""Some investors believe the disappointing Q3 results could force the company to more actively consider a potential M&A,"" said King.Charter Remains UnprofitableMalone's Liberty owns 27% of Charter, which emerged from bankruptcy in late 2009 and is still unprofitable. Charter, though, holds sizable tax credits that could boost the operating results of a combined Time Warner Cable-Charter, some analysts say.TWC had Q3 revenue of $5.52 billion.

742,CHTR,"It's not your imagination — the cost of pay-TV service is going through the roof. U.S. household spending on pay-TV service has risen 39% since 2010, according to a new report by Leichtman Research Group. Average reported monthly spending on pay-TV service is now $99.10, Leichtman said. That's up from $89.78 last year and $71.24 in 2010. Ten years ago, the average was $49.51.Leichtman notes that the figures are self-reported and that 18% of 2015 survey respondents either didn't know or did not provide their current spending.For its latest survey, Leichtman conducted a phone survey of 1,222 U.S. adults in June.Rising cable TV bills are often cited as a reason for talk of cord-cutting and cord-trimming — subscribers either canceling their pay-TV service or reducing the number of channels they get. There are also cord-nevers, who have never paid for cable, satellite or telecom TV.About 83% of U.S. households subscribe to some form of pay-TV service, analyst Bruce Leichtman said in a statement Thursday. The percentage of households that subscribe to a pay-TV service peaked at 88% in 2010 and has slid nearly every year since.Among TV households that do not currently subscribe to a pay-TV service, 17% paid for a service in the past year, while 70% of non-subscribers last subscribed over three years ago or never subscribed to a pay-TV service.Overall, about 2.5% of TV households paid to subscribe to a service in the past year, but currently do not — compared with 1.5% in 2010 and 2.3% in 2005, Leichtman said.Among the non-subscribers, 63% get a subscription Internet video-on-demand service like Netflix (NFLX) or Hulu and 62% have an over-the-air broadcast TV antenna.Renters are much more likely not to subscribe to pay TV.In households using a TV, 12% of homeowners do not subscribe to a pay-TV service, compared with 23% of renters.In the first six months of 2015, the 13 largest pay-TV providers in the U.S. lost a combined 463,000 subscribers. They lost 126,000 subscribers last year and 105,000 in 2013, Leichtman says.Comcast (CMCSA) has lost 77,000 video subscribers this year, after losing 194,000 in 2014 and 305,000 in 2013.Time Warner Cable (TWC) lost 10,000 video subscribers in the first half of 2015. It lost 401,000 in 2014 and 825,000 in 2013.Charter Communications (CHTR) lost 35,000 video subscribers in the first six months of this year. It lost 49,000 last year and 121,000 in 2013.Cablevision Systems (CVC) has lost 44,000 video subscribers so far this year. Cablevision lost 132,000 in 2014 and 80,000 in 2013.Satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) shed 215,000 subscribers in the first six months of the year. It lost 79,000 last year and gained only 1,000 in 2013.Telecom companies have been net gainers recently.AT&T (T) added 28,000 video subscribers in the first half of 2015, after signing up 660,000 in 2014 and 924,000 in 2013.Verizon Communications (VZ) tacked on 116,000 video subscribers in the first half of 2015.

Ruckus stock soared 16% in morning trading in the stock market today, at a three-month high above 12.A slowdown in education spending has been an overhang on Wi-Fi gear makers stocks, including Aruba Networks, acquired earlier this year by Hewlett-Packard (HPQ).Federal funding for educational spending on broadband might finally arrive in late 2015, analysts say. And Ruckus might gain from cable TV and phone company customers.""Schools are just now receiving their funding letters and we expect a pickup once school session begins,"" said Mark Sue, an analyst at RBC Capital, in a research report. ""We peg this multiyear (industry) opportunity for Wi-Fi at $1 billion, significant enough for Ruckus to see accelerating growth if it claims its share. Our 2016 revenues of $444 million are conservatively pegged at +19% growth.""Said Troy Jensen, analyst at Piper Jaffray, in a report: ""The company saw some modest (federal) E-Rate funding come in during the June quarter, but we believe once K-12 spending ramps in the 2H, Ruckus will continue reporting solid growth and operating leverage.""Ruckus also has upside from other sources, including a corporate upgrade cycle to next-generation Wi-Fi technology.The enterprise market — big corporate, government, education and health system customers — has the highest average selling prices and margins for network gear makers.Ruckus competes with Cisco Systems (CSCO), Aerohive Networks (HIVE) and Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT).In a challenge to Cisco, Ruckus and Juniper Networks recently formed a marketing alliance targeting enterprise customers.Cable TV companies such as Comcast (CMCSA), Charter Communications (CHTR) and Time Warner Cable (TWC) are expanding Wi-Fi networks.""Ruckus is well-positioned to benefit from movements both up-market (Juniper partnership) and down-market, as well as further activity from service providers, both with cable TV companies and mobile operators,"" said Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair & Co., in a report.Verizon Communications (VZ) and other wireless firms are eyeing unlicensed spectrum, as IBD reported, possibly emerging as bigger customers of Wi-Fi gear makers.In Q2, Ruckus said revenue rose 14% from the year-earlier period to $92.2 million, topping Wall Street estimates of $88 million. Ruckus earned 9 cents per share ex items, in line with views.In the current quarter, Ruckus forecast revenue of $96.5 million at its midpoint, about $1 million ahead on consensus estimates. It guided to EPS at 10 cents to 13 cents, including costs from litigation expenses. Analysts had modeled 12 cents.""Management continues to exercise caution in its forecast as it relates to (education spending),"" said Tim Long, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, in a report.

868,CHTR,"On Jul 2, the U.S. government denied Chinese telecom behemoth China Mobile (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHL  -  Free Report) from offering various telecom services in the United States. Notably, in 2011, China Mobile applied to the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) requesting permission to offer telecom services between the United States and other countries.The Trump administration is highly skeptical about the motives of China Mobile as it suspects that wireless services offered by the Chinese giant will be ultimately used to spy on U.S. strategic establishments. It is to be noted that the Chinese government controls 73% of China Mobile.National Security Concern: Government’s Top Priority In April, President Trump had issued an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecom equipment giants primarily ZTE and Huawei Technologies from selling products in the United States. The U.S. government had also prohibited indigenous mobile chipset developers and optical fiber component makers from selling products to these two firms.Further, Trump’s intention of restricting Chinese companies from investing in U.S. tech firms to prevent technology export to China is likely to add fuel to the fire.Trump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of products in the fields of high-tech digital technology driven sectors.Notably, most of the big manufacturers of these products are patronized by the Chinese government. These companies have become a serious threat to U.S. economic and military supremacy.U.S. Wireless Operators are Likely GainersPresident Trump’s decision to ban China Mobile from offering services in the United States will be a boon for incumbent wireless operators. Competition is intensifying in the U.S. wireless market.Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition. After a lackluster 2017, the U.S. wireless service operators have failed to turn their fortune around in 2018 so far.Intensified pricing competition has resulted in lower ARPU (average revenue per user) and margins. Moreover, massive investment for upcoming 5G wireless network and fiber optic buildout are the reasons for low free cash flow.Industry Consolidation and New EntryThe U.S. wireless industry is currently undergoing major consolidation. On April 2018, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) decided to merge their businesses. At present, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) together control around 68% of the U.S. wireless market. The merged entity of T-Mobile US and Sprint with around 32% market share will be a formidable challenger to both Verizon and AT&T.Furthermore, the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) and media behemoth Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has already forayed into this space with its Xfinity Mobile offering. Another cable giant Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) is reportedly close to launching its Spectrum Mobile wireless services.At this juncture, the entry of a big competitor like China Mobile — the largest wireless operator globally based-on subscriber count — would be detrimental to U.S. national wireless operators.The chart below shows price performance of four major national wireless operators year to date.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

869,CHTR,"The U.S. telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition, as success to a great extent depends on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability.  Additionally, the U.S. wireless industry is likely to become even more competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi-service operators) in this space.Entry of New Players in the Wireless SpaceComcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has already forayed into this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering. Presently, the company is utilizing its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon to use the latter’s wireless network along with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Importantly, the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year. Much like Comcast, the company too has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. The company has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network. These trials come on the back of spectrum test licenses granted to it by the FCC. The company is actively testing licensed small-cell technologies and has petitioned the FCC to release 3.5 GHz spectrum, popularly known as the CBRS band, for both licensed and unlicensed use.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands which will be utilized to deploy 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets. DISH Network’s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that the company has a clear plan of building a wireless network on its own.Additionally, Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) has entered into a new multi-year strategic agreement with Altice USA Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report). Per the terms of the agreement, Altice USA will utilize Sprint’s network to provide mobile voice and data services to customers throughout the country, and Sprint will leverage the Altice USA broadband platform to accelerate the densification of its network.Comcast, Charter Communications and Sprint currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will Geographical Expansion Stop? Cutting across barriers has become a fairly common practice for telecom players. The objective is to offer better service and customer convenience. However, President Trump has already threatened to terminate the previous Obama administration's efforts to normalize US-Cuba relations. All four leading U.S, wireless operators -- AT&T, Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile US -- have established business links with Cuba's Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba SA (ETECSA). Moreover, Trump may deal a major blow to Mexico as he believes that Mexico is to blame for the lack of jobs for Americans. At present, NAFTA is at turmoil. AT&T has strong business interest in Mexico.WeaknessesIn general, the beleaguered telecommunications companies have high debt levels and large financial leverage ratios. Moreover, they are often unable to cope with recent market trends. Other risks that pose threats are as follows:    •    Potential Business Slowdown: Sales fluctuations of carriers are expected to continue weighing on capital-spending decisions -- a major problem faced by equipment vendors. The companies are expected to retain focus on improving balance sheets, financial discipline and free cash-flow generation.      •    Product Overlapping: We may see more product-sharing deals between telecom, cable TV and satellite TV operators, as each of these players are vying to grab a sizeable share in each other’s territory. Even pay-TV services, offerings to business enterprises, mobile backhaul and metro-Ethernet segments may observe more convergence. Mobile phone makers are now progressively offering tablets and chipset manufacturers are providing chips for personal computers as well as mobile devices, thus frequently interchanging their areas of operations.    •    Intensified Competition: Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition. Product life-cycle and upgrade-cycle have been reduced drastically as several firms are coming up with new products and services within a short span of time. Increasing competition is compelling players to offer heterogeneous and bundled services to retain position in the space. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

870,CHTR,"The trends in the media industry have changed in the last three to four years. The internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have gradually shifted from cable TV operators to large telecom operators and low-cost over-the-top service providers. Cord cutting has emerged as a major threat to the entire media industry. Companies have lost video subscribers to online video streaming service providers such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com and YouTube because of their cheap source of TV programming. Declining advertising revenues have also affected the industry.Moreover, the U.S. pay-TV industry has also been affected by the massive consolidation between telecom and cable-TV operators. Gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators offer innovative packages. The multi-channel video market in the United States is almost saturated.In the face of such headwinds, companies in the space are struggling to stay ahead in the competition. The rising demand for technologically superior products is a silver lining for the companies in an otherwise tough environment. Comprehensive tax cuts, entry into the wireless industry and rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 technology are the major catalysts that bode well for this space.Given this backdrop, let’s focus on the comparative analysis of some key metrics of two companies in the media industry falling under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) — Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report). At present, Comcast has a market capitalization of $182.84 billion, while that of Charter Communications stands at $81.71 billion.Comcast versus CharterComcast is a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. Comcast is one of the largest video, high-speed Internet, phone services, wireless and security and automation service providers in the United States.Charter Communications is a leading broadband communications company and the second largest cable multi service operator (MSO) in the United States after Comcast.Currently, both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.We have assessed these media companies on the basis of the following parameters.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, shares of Charter Communications have returned 8.6%, outperforming the broader sector’s rally of 5.4%. The stock has performed better than Comcast, which has declined 8.3% in the said time frame. Valuation & Style ScoreWe have tried to evaluate Comcast and Charter Communications in terms of terms of price-to-earnings ratio (P/E - F1).With a P/E ratio of 14.5, Comcast’s valuation looks favorable compared with 20.7 for the industry. In contrast, Charter Communications is overvalued with a P/E ratio of 81.0. Notably, Comcast has an attractive VGM Score of B, which complements its encouraging valuation. Charter Communications lags on this front as it has a VGM Score of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Return on Equity (ROE)The return on equity (ROE) looks impressive for Comcast as against Charter Communications. The current ROE for Comcast stands at 16.5% while that for Charter Communications is pegged at 1.1% compared with the industry’s ROE of 13.8%.  Earnings Surprise History and ESPIn terms of earnings history, Comcast has delivered positive surprise in all the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 9.8%. However, Charter Communications’ earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, resulting in an average miss of 36.7%.But the situation changes when considering Earnings ESP values for the current quarter. While Comcast’s Earnings ESP is -0.70%, Charter Communications’ stands at +21.81%.Earnings Estimate RevisionsBased on the last 30 days earnings estimate revisions, Comcast appears to be a broker favorite right now.For Comcast, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 earnings increased 1.7% to 61 cents per share. However, the scenario for Charter Communications is just the opposite. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings has gone down 13.6% to 51 cents per share.  For full-year 2018, estimates have gone up 1.6% to $2.52 for Comcast while the same has gone down 4.4% to $4.32 for Charter Communications.Sales Estimates We expect first-quarter 2018 revenue growth of 10.5% for Comcast, which is significantly higher than 4.5% for Charter Communications.The picture is quite similar for the full-year 2018. We project 5.8% revenue growth for Comcast, higher than Charter Communications’ 4.8%.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Comcast scores over Charter Communications when considering valuation, style score, earnings history, earnings and sales estimate trends and return on equity. However, Charter Communications is superior when considering price performance and Earnings ESP.Key PicksTop-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer and Discretionary sector are Cable One (CABO  -  Free Report) and AMC Networks (AMCX  -  Free Report). While Cable One carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), AMC Networks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Cable One’s bottom line has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters with an average beat of 2.7%. AMC Networks surpassed the consensus estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 24.3%.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

871,CHTR,"On Mar 13, Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Charter Communications is the second largest cable multi service operator (MSO) in the United States after Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report).Why the Downgrade?Charter Communications operates in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market, which is a concern. Like other cable operators, the company has been losing subscribers to online video streaming service providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com, YouTube and others. Notably, in fourth-quarter 2017, Charter Communications had 16.544 million video customers in the residential segment, down 1.7% on a year-over-year basis. However, the company has managed to gain 2,000 video customers in the reported quarter, despite cord cutting. The company is expected witness similar subscriber loss this year as well.Further, poaching customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages. Moreover, the U.S. pay-TV industry is affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable-TV operators.Charter Communications’ high debt level is a potential hazard. At the end of 2017, Charter Communications had $621 million of cash and cash equivalents and $70,231 million of outstanding debt compared with $1,535 million and $62,464 million, respectively, at the end of 2016. The debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of 2017 was 0.59 compared with 0.54 at the end of 2016.Price PerformanceCharter Communications has not performed well in the past six months. Shares of Charter Communications have declined 4.5% as against the industry’s decline of 6.6% in the said timeframe. Unfavorable MetricsCharter Communications’ trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. Charter’s current ROE stands at 1.1% compared with the industry’s ROE of 13.8%. Moreover, in terms of price-to-earnings ratio (P/E - F1), the stock appears to be grossly overvalued. The stock currently trades at a P/E ratio of 83.2 compared with 21.1 for the industry.Notably, the stock has an unattractive VGM Score of C, which complements its discouraging valuation. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Negative Earnings SurpriseCharter Communications has a distressing earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, resulting in an average miss of 36.7%.Certainly Not a Broker FavoriteGiven the challenges faced by the company, the stock is not a favorite pick for brokers right now.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings for first-quarter 2018 has gone down 13.6% to 51 cents per share.  For full-year 2018, the estimate has gone down 4.4% to $4.32.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. Notably, the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Stocks to ConsiderTop-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer and Discretionary sector are Cable One (CABO  -  Free Report) and AMC Networks (AMCX  -  Free Report). While Cable One carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), AMC Networks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

872,CHTR,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in CHTR.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen three estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $4.77 a share a month ago to its current level of $4.32.Also, for the current quarter, Charter Communications has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 51 cents a share from 65 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 8.6% in the past month.Charter Communications, Inc.

Earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters and lagged the same in the remaining two quarters, with an average beat of 2.60%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsBased in Phoenix, AZ, Cable One is among the top 10 cable companies in the United States, serving more than 800,000 residential and commercial customers in 21 states with high-speed Internet, cable television and telephone service. As of Dec 31, 2016, it served 513,908 data customers, 320,246 video customers and 115,811 voice customers. The company provides consumers with a wide range of latest products and services, including wireless Internet service, high-definition programming and phone service with free, unlimited long-distance calling in continental United States.Cable One continues to make major changes in its channels and their availability to customers. New lineups were implemented to make news, sports and other channels easily accessible to viewers.We are also impressed with the company’s efforts to reward shareholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $1.75 per share. The dividend was paid on Dec 8, 2017 to stockholders of record at the closure of business on Nov 21, 2017. Notably, the company portrays an impressive record of dividend payouts.As investors prefer an income generating stock, a high dividend-yielding one is obviously much coveted. Needless to say, investors are always on the lookout for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Over the past three months, shares of Cable One have increased 2.5% while the industry to which it belongs has gained 4.7%. However, we are concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Moreover, cable companies continue to face stiff competition from online video streaming service providers such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. Furthermore, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages.Moreover, being a U.S. cable TV company, Cable One faces immense competition from leading cable multi-service-operators (MSO) like Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report). This is likely to be a major dampener to the company’s earnings.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cable One is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Cable One has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $5.87. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cable One has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Cable One, Inc.

876,CHTR,"Altice USA (ATUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, after market close. Based in Bethpage, NY, Altice USA is one of the largest broadband communications andvideo services providers in the United States.The company has a negative earnings surprise history. Earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 385%Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 EarningsAltice USA operates in a highly competitive, consumer and technology-driven market, which is likely to be affected by rapidly changing businesses and consumer choices. The company’s ability to increase the number of subscribers to its services is highly dependent on penetration rates.Further, higher programming costs and other operating expenses are likely to affect margins going forward. Altice USA’s programming costs increased 3% year over year in third-quarter 2017, primarily due to an increase in contractual programming rates, partially offset by a decrease in video customers. In the reported quarter, Optimum’s programming costs increased 3.5% to $482 million and Suddenlink’s programming costs increased 1.4% to $147 million, both on a year-over-year basis. Programming cost per customer is expected to increase going forward.Additionally, the company’s operations also remain susceptible to foreign currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks.Due to these headwinds, Altice USA has recorded a disappointing price performance. In the past six months, the stock has declined 39.9% compared with the industry’s loss of 3.6%. Despite such headwinds, the company continues to deploy fiber network in various international markets and ink different content and programming-related deals. Altice USA’s efforts to improve customer services, sales and marketing efficiencies through digitalization are bearing fruit. Though the carriage deal settlement with The Walt Disney Company led to uninterrupted access to some of Disney’s premium channels, pay-TV prices for Optimum customers rose on the back of high-quality video services and faster Internet. Altice USA and Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report) have reportedly reached an agreement to broadcast respective regional cable news networks. Its multi-year deal with Sprint (S  -  Free Report) will help Altice USA provide mobile voice and data services throughout the nation through Sprint’s network.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Altice USA is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Altice USA has an Earnings ESP of -60.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 2 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 1 cent. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Altice USA has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Altice USA, Inc.

878,CHTR,"The need to remain connected is essentially human. An era of digitization and technology is built on this need. It is here that telecommunications come to the fore as a necessary utility. The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecom space in an otherwise tough environment.With the global cable TV industry (part of the overall telecom industry) continuously evolving, companies in the league are fighting it out to stay ahead in the competition. The latest in the league is the newly launched DOCSIS 3.1 technology.DOCSIS 3.1 vs. DOCSIS 3.0  DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections. This technology was specifically designed as the cable TV industry’s answer to high-speed wireless and fiber-based wireline networks of telecom operators. The old-generation DOCSIS 3.0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest internet speed available in the market.The next-generation DOCSIS 3.1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3.0. Theoretically, while DOCSIS 3.0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds, DOCSIS 3.1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities. Additionally, DOCSIS 3.1 comes with several operational benefits.The technology is also backward compatible, allowing the present hybrid fiber-coaxial cable lines to allow such high internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3.1 compatible modem. Although FTTH has the advantage of providing unlimited bandwidth, backward compatibility is a major advantage of DOCSIS 3.1. This allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed Gigabit broadband to customers, without having to incur additional digging or other cable laying costs, unlike FTTH providers. This is sure to boost margins of cable MSOs.Major PlayersIn the United States, the largest cable MSO (multi service operator) Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) is extensively deploying DOCSIS 3.1 network in several markets. The company is offering 1 Gbps downstream and 35 Mbps upstream speeds for its DOCSIS 3.1 network. Mediacom Communications Corp., Cox Communications Inc., WideOpenWest Holdings LLC. (WOW  -  Free Report) and Cable ONE Inc. (CABO  -  Free Report) are other important players in this field.   Leading cable MSO Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) is the latest entrant in this market. The company has aimed to provide DOCSIS 3.1 standard across its presence of 50 million homes by the end of this year. Leveraging on DOCSIS 3.1, the company will offer its new Spectrum Internet Gig service (actually 940 Mbit/s downstream) nationwide in late 2018.Charter Communications has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). However, Comcast, WideOpenWest and Cable ONE each carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

880,CHTR,"T-Mobile US (TMUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before the market opens.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, the average positive surprise being 53.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to Influence Q4 EarningsT-Mobile Us is expected to deliver solid performance in the fourth quarter. In January 2018, the company revealed preliminary subscriber statistics for the to-be-reported quarter and 2017. The company gained a net of 5.7 million customers in 2017, which includes 3.6 million net customer additions in the postpaid segment. T-Mobile US exited 2017 with a total of 72.6 million customers. It was also the fourth consecutive year when the company gained more than 5 million subscribers. In the quarter under review, the company added a net of 1.9 million postpaid customers, making it the 19th straight quarter of more than 1 million net subscriber additions. In fourth-quarter 2017, customer churn was 1.18%, improving 10 basis points (bps) year over year and 5 bps sequentially.Meanwhile, the company’s share repurchases look encouraging. In 2017, the company repurchased approximately 7.0 million shares at an average price of $63.34 per share. The total purchase price was around $444 million. On Dec 6, 2017, the company’s board of directors approved a $1.5-billion share repurchase program. Notably, the stock buybacks were backed by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. The company is likely to maintain the flexible liquidity scenario in the upcoming quarter.Additionally, the company’s rating was upgraded to Ba2 by Moody's, with its rating outlook being confirmed stable. The company decided to roll out 600 MHz wireless spectrum in its footprints and has conducted successful Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) tests, live on its commercial network. T-Mobile US is also planning to team up with dark fiber partners to backhaul small cell densification project.On the flip side, the company continues to struggle in a highly competitive and saturated wireless market where success depends on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Moreover, the domestic wireless industry is likely to become more competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable operators like Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report). Launch of several low-priced service plans for individual consumers and small business entities lead to high cash burn for the company.RevenuesWe expect T-Mobile US to see an improvement in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services revenues is pegged at $7,796 million. The estimate shows an improvement from $7,629 million and $7,245 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Within the Service segment, branded postpaid revenue estimate of $5,044 million is higher than $4,920 million and $4,680 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Branded prepaid revenues estimate of $2,409 million is higher $2,376 million and $2,227 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Wholesale revenues estimate of $262 million lags $274 million reported in the last quarter.Roaming & other services revenues estimate of $74 million is higher than $59 million reported in the last quarter.Equipment revenues estimate of $2,809 million is above $2,118 million and $2,740 million in third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively.Price PerformanceT-Mobile US portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, the stock has rallied 8.2% compared  with the industry’s gain of 6.8%.  When compared with the market at large, the stock compares favorably with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 2.2%.  T-Mobile US' innovative network expansion methodologies and improvement plans, stellar network performance, deployment of LTE-U technology and offering of attractive unlimited data are key factors behind the mounting performance. This is supported by improving scale, healthy free cash flow generation, strong liquidity and valuable spectrum assets that also provide credit support.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that T-Mobile US is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

882,CHTR,"Leading U.S cable TV operator, Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), primarily offers three services – video, high-speed data and voice over its broadband cable systems to both residential and business customers.We are concerned about Charter Communications’ operations in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Like other cable operators, the company continues to lose subscribers to online video streaming service providers because of their cheap source of TV programming. Notably, in the third quarter of 2017, the company lost 1, 04,000 video customers in the residential segment.On the other hand, the twin buyouts of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks have strengthened the company’s foothold in hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and fiber networks. The company is also adopting various initiatives to improve its Spectrum products and cloud-based user interfaces. Also, accelerated residential and commercial customer growth, investments in business services division and rollout of several initiatives should aid the upcoming results.Charter Communications currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

883,CHTR,"The U.S. wireless telecommunications industry has been trending down over the past several quarters. The decline continued in the first quarter of 2017 results as well.The domestic wireless industry continues to struggle with some major inherent headwinds like saturation issues, pricing competition, technological changes and marketing costs associated with any kind of promotional offers.Let’s take a closer look at how these factors have impacted the industry negatively.SaturationThe U.S. wireless industry is already saturated, where spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the domestic telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it difficult to manage mobile data traffic, which is growing by leaps and bounds. The situation has become acute with the growing popularity of smartphones, online mobile video streaming, cloud computing and video conferencing services.Intra-Industry CompetitionApart from saturation issues, competition is becoming intense in the United States wireless postpaid and prepaid industry. The gap between prepaid and postpaid average revenue per user (ARPU) has narrowed significantly, forcing telecom biggies to turn their attention to domestic prepaid mobile service business.Stiff pricing competition in the industry is a genuine concern. Few months back, we witnessed four major wireless telecommunications companies, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report), participating in the unlimited postpaid data plan war in order to remain competitive. These wireless operators are now extending their unlimited data plan to the prepaid market as well.Inter-Industry Competition Two major national cable behemoths, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) have agreed to jointly work on their wireless services businesses so as to better explore their opportunities, accelerate and enhance each other’s ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace. Recently, Comcast completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand. Meanwhile, Charter Communications plans to offer wireless service in 2018. The wireless venture is also aimed at retaining customers in this competitive world. Satellite TV operator DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report), is also looking for wireless opportunities. It already has a strong portfolio of wireless spectrum.Promotional Liquidity WoesAdditionally, the companies have been continuously trying to lure customers with attractive promotional plans and lucrative discounts, as a counteractive measure against the competition posed by other carriers. This has led to a high cash burn rate and heavy losses for these companies.Price Performance: Jan - Jun, 2017The downfall has been noticed in their price performances. Over the six months span from January-June 2017, the shares of Verizon, Sprint and AT&T have declined 16.3%, 2.5% and 11.3%, respectively while that of T-Mobile US soared 5.4%. When compared with the market at large, the stock’s performance looks miserable, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 9.3%.Big Beat in Second-Quarter 2017Financial results of the national wireless carriers for the quarter ended Jun 30, 2017, was a positive. We witness a stark improvement in terms of their revenue growth and subscriber statistics.Let’s have a closer view on their prospects: -Verizon reported an addition of 614,000 postpaid customers and 19,000 prepaid customers in the last reported second-quarter 2017, compared with a loss of 307,000 postpaid and 17,000 prepaid customers in the first quarter of 2017. Meanwhile, total revenue increased 0.1% year over year to $30,548 million.AT&T had 136.500 million total subscribers, with 196,000 million postpaid wireless additions.T-Mobile US’ innovative network expansion methodologies have lured 1.333 million net customers, signifying the 17th successive quarter of over 1 million net customer additions. The company’s total revenue jumped 10% year over year to $10,213 million in the reported quarter.Sprint registered an impressive number of customer additions for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As of Jun 30, 2017, Sprint had 53.698 million wireless connections (up 0.63% year over year), with net additions of 61,000 wireless customers. Quarterly total revenue amounted $8,157 million, up 1.81% year over year.Notably, backed by such impressive subscriber additions and revenue growth, the management of all these four companies have raised their outlook for full-year 2017.All the above-mentioned stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price Performance: Jul - Aug, 2017We get to see a remarkable improvement in the price performances of the wireless carriers. Over these two months span from July-August 2017, the share price of Verizon, T-Mobile US, Sprint and AT&T has rallied 8.6%, 4.7%, 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. When compared to the market at large, the stock’s performance looks favorable, as the S&P 500 index inched up 2.1%, over the same time span.What to Expect in Second-Half of 2017?On the back of such impressive financial results, we expect the trend to rise further in the coming quarters of 2017. This should likely have a positive influence in the second half of this year.At present, the U.S. telecom industry enjoys several positive attributes. First, the new telecom regulatory body – Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – has given enough indications that it will be less stringent compared with the Obama administration and is likely to roll back several regulations of the previous regime. Second, the less restrictive nature of the FCC will aid mergers and acquisitions which are likely to spur growth in 2017. Third, a growing U.S. economy drives demand for real-time voice, data and video. This escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

884,CHTR,"Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report) is counting on remote-controlled door locks and cameras along with its other smart-home services to speed up its budding home security business.Notably, smart-home market embraces devices ranging from door locks to sprinkler systems that can be programmed to various schedules. Going forward, Comcast is planning to initiate a pilot program for customers who doesn’t need a full home security system but want to ensure safety of their home. Moreover, the company will be offering a video camera for an additional $10 per month along with its Xfinity Internet. Also, up to six cameras can be purchased by customers, for $99 each, besides the monthly fee. The monthly fee covers for installation, cloud storage for video recordings and the ability to create and share video clips.In 2012, Comcast had launched its Xfinity Home service (home automation and security business). Based on this particular service, the company currently has almost 1 million subscribers, who can easily manage, control and operate a number of key smart home functions, including energy consumption management.In fact, Comcast wants to offer more smart-home services to increase their revenues and create more loyal customers in the near term.Meanwhile, the company has been expanding into new lines of business as growth in selling cable-TV subscriptions has slowed down due to cord cutting. Online video streaming providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com, YouTube etc., also pose severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of programming. Therefore, to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, cable companies like Comcast and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) are jointly venturing into U.S. wireless services business, competing head to head with market incumbents like AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report).On Aug 17, Comcast completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand. On a broader scale, the Xfinity Mobile service is an evidence of Comcast's intentions to move beyond the home its own regional subscriber territory.Markedly, the cable company's entry into the Internet of Things space and its licensing of the X1 platform, internationally, further implies growth at a broader scale.Recently, the company inked a 40-month deal with Sunrun Inc. on residential solar programs. Per the agreement, Sunrun will act as the exclusive residential solar energy provider for Comcast Cable (one of the primary businesses of Comcast), which will serve as one of its strategic partners through marketing campaigns in selected markets.Zacks Rank & Price Performance Comcast currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

885,CHTR,"Leading cable multi service operator and media giant Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has inked a 40-month deal with Sunrun Inc. (RUN  -  Free Report) on residential solar programs. Per the agreement, Sunrun will act as the exclusive residential solar energy provider for Comcast Cable (one of the primary businesses of Comcast). Comcast Cable will serve as one of Sunrun’s strategic partners through marketing campaigns in selected markets. Sunrun is the nation’s largest provider of residential solar, storage and energy services.Comcast plans to begin marketing Sunrun’s rooftop solar services to its customers in selected states later this year.  This agreement follows a successful one-year solar pilot program in which participating Comcast subscribers will have the option of signing up for a Sunrun BrightSave plan. The BrightSave plan allows customers enjoy 20 years of solar energy at a fixed monthly rate.As part of this agreement, Comcast will receive fees for new customers they bring to Sunrun. Comcast is also eligible to acquire as much as 9.99% of Sunrun’s stock if it can lock down 60,000 customers.In their joint press release, Comcast and Sunrun pointed out that rooftop solar is projected to be one of the fastest growing sectors in the energy industry, nearly tripling in size in the United States by 2025 (from a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report).Moreover, residential solar industry will continue to expand over the next decade as consumers are looking for cost-effective, independent and eco-friendly alternatives for energy resources. This will not only reduce expenses on electric bills but also reduce their dependence on fossil fuels.With its Xfinity Home service (home automation and security business), Comcast currently has almost 1 million subscribers, who can easily manage, control and operate a number of key smart home functions, including energy consumption management. Hence, working with Sunrun on smart solar energy and storage solutions for consumers perfectly complements Comcast’s efforts to offer smart home services.For fiscal 2017, Sunrun has nearly doubled its addressable market and is currently available in 22 states and the District of Columbia. This is allowing more consumers across the country to save on their electric bills.  Bottom LineComcast has been expanding into new lines of business as growth in selling cable-TV subscriptions has slowed down due to cord cutting. Online video streaming providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com, YouTube etc., pose severe competitive threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming. In the last reported second-quarter 2017, Comcast lost 34,000 video customers and 22,000 voice customers and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) lost 90,000 video customers.In order to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, cable companies like Comcast and Charter are jointly venturing into U.S. wireless services business, competing head to head with market incumbents like AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report). Comcast recently completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the Xfinity Mobile brand, while Charter plans to offer wireless service in 2018.Meanwhile, Comcast is trying to expand its business of selling home alarm systems and TV, phone and Internet for businesses.Zacks Rank and Price PerformanceBoth Comcast and Sunrun currently sport a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

886,CHTR,"U.S. telecom behemoth,AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) has initiated the deployment of G.fast based services, which is in line with its efforts to expand its high speed broadband services.In fact, after a recent successful completion of field trial of G.fast in Minneapolis, the company has commenced the roll out of the service in 22 major metro areas in the United States.What is G.fast?G.fast is a digital subscriber line alternative that extends the frequency range and helps operators to offer fiber-like speeds without making the huge investments associated with taking optics directly to homes and offices. Notably, this technology is gradually coming into the limelight.Telecom operators are currently focusing on increasing their fiber footprint. However, there are areas where fiber networks are yet to reach. Going forward, they are likely to provide  alternate solutions for high-speed Internet service through the existing copper networks. Interestingly, G.fast is one such networking protocol that allows higher Internet speeds within a short range of the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier.This technology will provide access to high speed broadband, connecting multiple dwelling unit (MDU) subscribers. The service will be distributed over a blend of fiber and coax cable, and is expected to deliver speeds up to 500 Mbps.However, the company will also utilize the infrastructure of DirecTV, which had wired up a fat number of MDUs with coax for satellite TV. Thus, apart from saving time it will also be a hassle-free process. With this service AT&T is expected to broaden its broadband subscriber base and improve churn rate trends. This, in turn, will make the company a contender to larger cable operators like Charter Communications, Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report).Price Performance & Zacks RankAT&T’s price performance has been dull for the last three months. The stock was down 0.5% against the industry’s gain of 1.1% in the same period. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to Consider                                  Investors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may also consider America Movil SAB (AMX  -  Free Report), which has expected Earnings per share growth of 55.87% over the last three to five years.

887,CHTR,"Premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017) results on Aug 24, before the market opens.In the trailing four quarters, the company has delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 0.79%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to PlayIn the last three months, Hormel Foods’ shares lost 3.6%, as against 7.9% gain incurred by the industry.Fall in turkey prices, extensive competition and increase in overall operating expenses have weighed on the Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store business segment’s performance in the preceding two quarters. The company perceives these headwinds to persist and in turn depress the top and bottom-line performance even in the second half of the fiscal year.Moreover, other adverse headwinds such as a stronger U.S. currency, price inflation of major inputs (such as beef, pork and poultry) or outbreak of any livestock disease are likely to weigh over its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarters.However, amid the aforementioned negativities, Hormel Foods is poised to boost its near-term revenues on the back of stronger demand for popular brands like Skippy and Justin's. Moreover, the company’s ongoing $190 million capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2017 is likely to generate benefits moving ahead.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hormel Foods is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Hormel Foods currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock of 37 cents per share is in line with the Most Accurate estimate.Hormel Foods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Hormel Foods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Hormel Foods Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Hormel Foods’ unfavorable Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), when combined with a 0.00% ESP; makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Key PicksHere are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.

888,CHTR,"Per a recent report by, Leichtman Research Group Inc. (LRG), the cable multi-service operators (MSOs) in the U.S. have successfully maintained their lead over telecom operators in the high-speed broadband (internet) market. This comes as a respite, especially at a time when cable TV operators have been losing their foothold in the core video market to fiber-based telecom operators and online video streaming service providers.According to data compiled by LRG, 14 prime cable TV and telecom operators jointly had approximately 94.1 million high-speed internet subscribers at the end of the second quarter of 2017, representing more than 95% of the country’s total broadband market. Of the count cited, cable MSOs commanded nearly 59.91 million subscribers (63.6%) while the remaining 34.24 million customers (36.8%) were serviced by telecom operators.Nevertheless, the LRG report also stated that despite strong showing, the growth rate of residential high-speed internet for the cable TV industry has actually declined significantly year over year in the second quarter of 2017. Per LRG, the top seven U.S. cable MSOs added a net 461,997 high-speed broadband customers in the second quarter of 2017, a significant deceleration of 16.5% year over year.In the second quarter of 2017, the top two cable MSOs, namely, Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) added 267,000 and 175,000 high-speed broadband subscribers, respectively. On the other hand, telecom behemoths Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), lost 23,000 and 9,000 customers, respectively. Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR  -  Free Report) lost a mammoth 101,000 high-speed internet users followed by 77,000 by CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report). All the above mentioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereIn the last 10 years, the internal dynamics of the pay-TV market have been gradually shifting from cable TV offerings to fiber-based video services of large telecom operators. Moreover, the strong presence of online video streaming providers is posing a significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable TV operators, seems to be slipping out of their hands fast.However, of late, with the deployment of the next-generation DOCSIS 3.0 and DOCSIS 3.1 technologies, cable TV operators have extensively penetrated into the high-speed internet market. In an attempt to capitalize on this technology, leading cable TV operators are increasingly emphasizing on the broadband market. At this juncture, a strong momentum in the high-speed data (Internet) market bodes well for cable MSOs.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

889,CHTR,"U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has gained the third position, pushing Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) to the fourth in the U.S. Ethernet Carrier Services Leaderboard by Vertical Systems Group (VSG).We believe that Verizon’s ethernet growth is backed by the prospects of the acquisition of privately held XO Communications Inc.’s dark fiber optic network (in February 2017).The acquisition of XO Communications has helped Verizon enhance its metro and on-net fiber footprint. Verizon gained metro fiber networks in 40 major U.S. markets and a 13,000-route mile metro network with more than 4,000 on-net business buildings and 1.2 million fiber miles.Additionally, Verizon gained a fiber-based IP and Ethernet network consisting of 20,000 route mile intercity network in the United States and Canada. The network covers 85 major metropolitan markets in these two countries offering data transfer speed up to 100 Gbps. These factors will aid Verizon fortify its ethernet footprint.Moreover, XO Communications’ fiber assets will enable the company to enhance its dark fiber-based solutions for its small cell network. The densification of cell network will significantly help the company to install and build its upcoming 5G network.The companies in the latest leaderboard are AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Level 3 Communications Inc. , Verizon, Charter, CenturyLink Inc. (CTL), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), Windstream Holdings Inc. (WIN  -  Free Report) and Cox, in terms of their respective positions.  All of these eight companies on the leaderboard have at least 4% or more of the U.S. Ethernet services each.It is interesting to note that Level 3 Communications is the only fiber-optic network service provider – in the Leaderboard category. The other seven companies are incumbent telecom carriers - AT&T, Verizon, CenturyLink and Windstream or cable MSOs (multi-service operators) - Charter’s Spectrum Enterprise, Comcast and Cox.Several analysts and research reports claim that while growth rate has slowed down, demand for Carrier Ethernet services remains very strong in 2017. The revenue and profitability outlooks for many providers are improving as fiber build outs are completed and pricing begins to stabilize.Further, we expect that mergers and acquisitions will play a major role in altering future ratings on VSG’s upcoming Ethernet Leaderboards.   Zacks Rank and Price PerformanceVerizon currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Extensive network of fiber-based video services from telecom operators and the strong presence of online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable TV operators.These online video streaming channels provide an extremely cheap source of TV programming unless the customer is eager to view real-time programs like sports events. This business model is gaining momentum, even during economic uncertainties and have proven to be a threat to the pay-tv industry’s business.The industry has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators and online streaming service providers. Leading cable multi service operator and media giant Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) NBC Universal segment fared well, but its Cable business is suffering from subscriber losses. The company added a net of 175,000 high-speed internet customers but lost 34,000 video customers and 22,000 voice customers in the reported quarter.Charter Communications Inc.’s (CHTR  -  Free Report) commercial segment also fared well, which is evident from the revenue and subscriber growth in the reported quarter. However, the company lost 90,000 video customers in the residential segment. It is the second cable MSO after Comcast.The domestic multi-channel video market has also become extremely saturated and intensely competitive. Moreover, the US. pay-TV industry remains affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable TV operators to strengthen their base.In order to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering internet TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates.Telecom and pay-TV behemoth AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) had 38.8 million video subscribers (inclusive of 491,000 DIRECTV NOW) and 15.7 million broadband connections in the reported quarter. However, in the reported quarter, AT&T lost 195,000 U-verse customers and 156,000 satellite TV customers. DIRECTV NOW is the over the top (OTT) online streaming service of AT&T.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report), the second largest satellite TV operator in the United States, lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company lost 46,000 broadband subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 15,000 in the year-ago quarter.However, the trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to point toward an unprecedented annual decline.All the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

891,CHTR,"On Aug 17, leading cable multi service operator and media giant Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services under the “Xfinity Mobile” brand.Based on a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) agreement with U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Xfinity Mobile will be using Verizon's 4G LTE wireless network. The service is available across all of Comcast’s distribution platforms, including the company’s newly redesigned retail stores and a new online experience at XfinityMobile.com.Comcast Wireless Service/Brand - Xfinity MobileWith improving quality of mobile broadband and declining price per gigabyte, there's an increasing risk to wireline ISPs (Internet Service Providers) like Comcast which can lose consumers from home Internet to mobile services. However, with Xfinity Mobile, the company is making both home Internet service and mobile access available at a reasonable price.Presently, Xfinity Mobile is being offered with data plan options - unlimited data plan for $45 per month for up to five lines with no usage limits or By the Gig plan for $12 per month for each gigabyte of cellular data used. Users who primarily rely on WiFi can choose the $12. Further, consumers can also get access to 18 million Wi-Fi hotspots with Xfinity Mobile.Comcast claims that customers can save upto 30% on their monthly wireless bills with Xfinity Mobile service. The cable operator, however did not, reveal the number of subscribers who have signed up for the service since it began its rollout. Xfinity Mobile is expected to be the nation’s first wireless service combining the nation’s largest and most reliable 4G LTE network with 18 million Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspots to deliver a great wireless experience, which is cost effective.Comcast’s Wireless Venture So FarComcast has been long planning for its much-hyped wireless venture. On May 8, 2017, Comcast and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) announced their plans to jointly work on their wireless services businesses so as to better explore their opportunities, accelerate and enhance each other’s ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace. Moreover, both companies plan to enhance their wireless scalabilities with new ventures like the creation of common operating platforms, technical standards development, device forward and reverse logistics and emerging wireless technology platforms to name a few. We believe that such attempts to increase efficiencies should provide better options, innovative products and competitive prices for customers. Additionally, both companies’ regional wireless businesses using 4G LTE network have been considerably doing well. Hence, we look forward to the success of this joint wireless venture.Moreover, Comcast had also bought $1.7 billion in wireless spectrum at a Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Broadcast Incentive auction in April 2017, to bolster its wireless services. Charter Communications plans to offer wireless service in 2018.However, we believe that the joint entry of these two major U.S. cable multi-service operators (MSOs) will make the intensely competitive domestic wireless industry a more conflicting battleground.On a broader scale, the Xfinity Mobile service is an evidence of Comcast's intentions to move beyond the home its own regional subscriber territory. The cable company's entry into the Internet of Things space and its licensing of the X1 platform, internationally, further implies growth at a broader scale.Bottom LineThe wireless venture may be aimed at retaining customers in this competitive world. Apart from a saturated multi-channel domestic video market, the U.S. pay-TV industry also remains affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable TV operators to strengthen their base. Meanwhile, online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., pose severe competitive threats to cable TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming, which is in vogue even in volatile economic conditions.Zacks Rank and Price PerformanceOver the past three months, shares of Comcast have rallied 3.66%, failing to beat the 7.26% growth of the industry it belongs to.At present, Comcast carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

893,CHTR,"Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), the second largest cable multi-service operator (MSO) in the U.S., has launched lucrative promotional offers in order to stay competitive with a strong subscriber base. The cable company is offering a double-play package of Spectrum TV (more than 130 channels) and 60 Mbps internet (100 Mbps in some markets) for $29.99 each. The package includes Showtime for free of cost during the one-year span of the promotion. With a $5.99 extra for an HD set-top, the bundle costs $65.97 a month before taxes. The Spectrum TV was launched by Charter Communications, after the twin buyout ofTime Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House Networks (BHC), and is aimed at uniting the viewing experience of these two big MSOs on a single podium. The new Spectrum TV app also supports legacy Charter Communications customers as well as those who came on board via the company’s acquisitions of TWC and BHN.Additionally, Charter Communications has been undertaking various initiatives to make its Spectrum products even better. The company has developed its cloud-based user interface named Spectrum Guide, to run on all set-top boxes offering advanced video navigation.

They are losing their customers to wireless telecom operators as well as online streaming service providers. The existing saturation and competition of the multi-channel U.S. video market has led to this loss. Moreover, online video streaming service providers such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., pose severe threat to cable TV operators due to cheap source of TV programming.Zacks Rank and Price PerformancePresently, Charter Communications is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

895,CHTR,"Cable ONE Inc. (CABO  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.20%. However, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 5.80%.Over the past three months, shares of Cable ONE have increased 12.76% while the industry to which it belongs gained 1.98%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayBased in Phoenix, AZ, Cable ONE is among the top 10 cable companies in the U.S., serving more than 800,000 residential and commercial customers in 21 states with high-speed internet, cable television and telephone service. As of Dec 31, 2016, it served 513,908 data customers, 320,246 video customers and 115,811 voice customers. The company provides consumers with a wide range of latest products and services, including wireless internet service, high-definition programming and phone service with free, unlimited long-distance calling in the continental U.S.Cable ONE made major changes in its channels and their availability to customers. New lineups were implemented to make news, sports and other channels easily accessible to viewers. We are also impressed with the company’s efforts to reward shareholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $1.75 per share, marking an increase of 25 cents per share in the company’s quarterly cash dividend. The dividend will be paid on Sep 1 to stockholders of record at the closure of business on Aug 15.  The acquisition of NewWave Communications (a cable operator providing high-speed data, video and voice services) will create a leading high-speed data and cable company serving more than 1.2 million primary service units in 21 states. The deal will aid Cable ONE to expand its footprint into additional non-metropolitan markets and non-urban areas like Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas, for which the company has optimized its strategy and operations.On the other hand, we are concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Moreover, cable companies continue to face stiff competition from online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. Furthermore, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages.Moreover, being a US cable TV company, Cable ONE faces immense competition from leading cable multi-service-operators (MSO) like Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report). This is likely to act as a major dampener to the company’s earnings.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cable ONE is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Cable ONE has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $5.10. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cable ONE has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Cable One, Inc.

897,CHTR,"As talk surrounding the possibility of a deal between SoftBank Group  and Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report) continues to heat up, shares of the two companies moved in opposite directions on Monday.News of the deal began to circulate over the weekend after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Japanese-based internet and telecommunications powerhouse SoftBank hoped to facilitate a merger between Charter and Sprint (S  -  Free Report), a SoftBank subsidiary.The potential deal would see SoftBank create a new public company that merged Charter and Sprint under one roof, which would then be controlled by the Japanese company. However, Charter has already turned down the proposed merger.“We understand why a deal is attractive for SoftBank, but Charter has no interest in acquiring Sprint,” Alex Dudley, a Charter spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “We have a very good MVNO relationship with Verizon and intend to launch wireless services to cable customers next year.”Now, Masayoshi Son, the outspoken founder and CEO of SoftBank is reportedly set to make a direct bid for Charter. Bloomberg first reported that Son is ready to scrap his previous merger proposal for a new outright bid, which he is apparently ready to announce later this week.Shares of Charter jumped 4.72% in early afternoon trading, after moving at more than double its average volume already. On the other side of the aisle, SoftBank dipped 2.99%, while Sprint fell roughly 3% in early afternoon trading.Key Facts to NoteCharter currently claims to be the “fastest growing TV, Internet and Voice provider” in the U.S., according to its website, and the company boasts a robust market cap of $118.35 billion. But Charter’s name isn’t always front and center.The company purchased Time Warner Cable and Bright House networks in 2016, which helped it become the second largest cable company in the U.S. behind Comcast. The $65 billion merger eventually led Charter to rebrand its new massive offering of cable, internet, and phone services, which serves more than 26 million customers, as Spectrum.Shares of Charter have skyrocketed over the last five years and have jumped from roughly $218 per share in May 2016 to $387 a share today.On the other hand, SoftBank, led by its outwardly ambitious CEO has seen its stock price fluctuate heavily over that same time period. The company currently sits roughly $3 below its 52-week high.SoftBank owns a majority stake in Yahoo Japan and was one of Alibaba’s (BABA  -  Free Report) first big investors. The company took control of Sprint in 2012 and even tried to buy T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report) in 2015—but regulators blocked the deal.Despite its strong run, Charter currently has about $60 billion in debt. And a Charter deal would become the most expensive in SoftBank’s history.“Son is going back to his bad old days of wanting to conquer the world, just as we thought he was becoming more sensible,” Amir Anvarzadeh, head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore, told Bloomberg.  “It does sound as if they’re doing anything but de-leveraging. They’re re-leveraging.”SoftBank is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and scored an “A” for Value in our style score system. Charter is also a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but the company scored a “D” for both Value and Momentum in our style score system.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

899,CHTR,"Leading U.S cable TV operator, Charter Communications Inc.

Notably, the Time Warner Cable and Bright House deals have benefited Charter Communications in terms of geographic expansion and operating cost synergies, which in turn, should boost its bottom line and free cash flow in the upcoming quarterly results.On the flip side, Charter Communications continues to operate in a saturated multi-channel U.S. video market. Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from online video streaming service providers as they provide an extremely cheap source of TV programming.

900,CHTR,"As per the Zacks Industry categorization, the Cable Television industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector, which is one of the 16 Zacks sectors.The cable television industry, one of the important industries in the U.S., has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators and online streaming service providers. The existing saturation and competition of the multi-channel domestic video market has caused this loss. Online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., pose severe threat to cable TV operators due to their cheap source of TV programming.In order to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering internet TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates. Meanwhile, two major cable multi service operators (MSOs) in the U.S., Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), have agreed to jointly work on their wireless services businesses to explore opportunities, and accelerate and enhance each other’s ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace.With such mixed prospects and strategic business ideas, the industry has gained 18.62% outperforming the S&P 500’s increase of 13.7% over the past one year.The upcoming weeks will see some of the major cable television companies, such as Comcast Corp., Charter Communications, DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) and Liberty Global plc. (LBTYA  -  Free Report) releasing second-quarter 2017 earnings results.Shaw Communications Inc. (SJR  -  Free Report) has reported impressive financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, on Jun 28, wherein both the bottom and top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  While Comcast and Charter Communications will report results on Jul 27, before market opens, Liberty Global plans to release its numbers on Aug 7, after market close. We look forward to see how these cable companies will perform.An Overview of Q2 Earnings (As of Jul 21, 2017) We are in the thick of the second-quarter earnings season with results from 97 S&P 500 members, accounting for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization (based on the latest Earnings Preview article). Total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the year-ago period on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating EPS estimates and 72.2% surpassing revenue estimates.More than 800 companies will report results this week, including 183 S&P 500 members.Q2 Expectations (as a whole & sector specific)For the second quarter, we anticipate the prospects of companies to improve steadily. In fact, our latest scorecard projects total second-quarter earnings improvement of 8.6% from the year-ago period on 4.7% higher revenues. This would follow 13.3% earnings growth in first-quarter 2017 on 7.0% revenue growth, recording the highest increase in almost two years.We predict that second-quarter earnings in the Consumer and Discretionary space will decline 1.5%, while revenues will rise 7.8% from the year-ago period.Cable TV Stocks’ Expected Q2 Earnings Release on Jul 27Our quantitative model offers some insight into stocks that are about to report earnings. Per the model, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to deliver an earnings beat.Meanwhile, we also caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Investors interested in cable TV stocks can watch out for the two cable companies that are expected to report their second-quarter 2017 numbers, before the opening bell on Jul 27.Headquartered in Pennsylvania, Comcast is one of the leading cable MSOs in the U.S.The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.08% because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 49 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents.

901,CHTR,"Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report), the leading cable multi-service operator (MSO) in the U.S., is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.In the last four quarters, Comcast’s bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and surpassed only once in the year-ago quarter. The average beat is 5.11%.Meanwhile, shares of Comcast have witnessed a gain of 2.96% in the past three months, outshining the industry’s decline of 0.74%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why Do We Expect a Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Comcast is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key elements.Zacks ESP: Comcast has an Earnings ESP of +2.08%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 49 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 48 cents. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Comcast has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of the company’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Comcast Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Comcast Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Comcast Corporation QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Comcast has forayed into the over-the-top video delivery market with the launch of its Internet TV service, Stream. We believe that this will aid the company check customer churn and provide viewers with more streaming options and flexibility at competitive prices. Further, Comcast’s Cable business is doing well and the NBC Universal segment is witnessing significant improvement. The improvement is evident from the revenue earned in the last-reported quarter. Notably, Cable Communications Segment’s total revenue amounted to $12,912 million, up 5.8% rise year over year. NBC Universal Segment’stotal revenue was $7,868 million, up 14.7% year over year. We expect to witness the same in the second quarter of 2017.Comcast's decision to venture into the U.S. wireless space in collaboration with Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) bodes well for its diversified business model. The company also expanded its theme park business through the purchase of the remaining 49% stake in Osaka-based Universal Studios Japan (USJ), for $2.3 billion. We believe that this should help witness revenue growth in its Theme Parks business. Further, the company continues to strengthen its foothold in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) space and also in the lucrative digital media market through different deals.However, intense competition, consolidation-related woes, lawsuits and their related fines and a highly leveraged balance sheet remain headwinds to the upcoming results of Comcast.Online streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. pose severe competitive threat because of their cheap source of TV programming. Loss against TiVo Corp (TIVO  -  Free Report) over a patent licensing dispute is a major setback.Another major concern for Comcast is its spiraling programming expenses. Operating costs and expenses totaled $13,431 million, climbing 8.1% year over year in the last reported first quarter of 2017. We look forward to seeing how far the company succeeds in reducing its expenses in the to-be reported quarter.Key PickHere’s a company in the broader Consumer and Discretionary sector — which houses Comcast — with the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Penn National Gaming, Inc.

902,CHTR,"Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), the second largest cable MSO in the U.S., is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 42.42%. However, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 94.11%.Over these last months, shares of Charter Communications have witnessed an increase of 1.62%, outshining the industry‘s decline of 0.74%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence this QuarterWe are impressed with Charter Communications’ efforts to venture into the U.S. wireless industry along with the U.S. cable multi-service operators (MSO) Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report). We look forward to how these cable companies will explore their opportunities while accelerating and enhancing each other’s ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace. For this wireless venture, the companies will be using U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc.’s (VZ  -  Free Report) wireless network, through a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) agreement.The twin buyout of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks have strengthened its foothold in hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and fiber networks. This will aid the company to better address small, medium-sized and large businesses. Notably, the Time Warner Cable and Bright House deals have benefited Charter Communications in terms of geographic expansion and operating cost synergies. This should boost the company’s bottom line and free cash flow in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is also adopting various initiatives to improve its Spectrum products and cloud-based user interfaces. Also, accelerated residential and commercial customer growth, investments in business services division and rollout of several initiatives should help the upcoming results.On the other hand, we are concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. as they provide cheap source of TV programming. Furthermore, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages. Meanwhile, we opine that the high debt levels are a potential hazard.We hope that the cable company’s recent carriage disputes with different channels will not severely affect its to-be-reported quarterly results.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Charter Communications is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Charter Communications has an Earnings ESP of -20.99%.

903,CHTR,"As per the Zacks Industry categorization, the Cable Television industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector, which is one of the 16 Zacks sectors.The cable television industry, being one of the important industries in the U.S., has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators as well as online streaming service providers. Notably, the existing saturation and competition of the multi-channel U.S. video market has led to this loss. Online video streaming service providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com, YouTube etc., pose severe threat to cable TV operators due to cheap source of TV programming.In order to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering internet TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates. Moreover, two of major cable multi service operators (MSOs) in U.S., Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), are planning to enter the domestic wireless industry.With such mixed prospects and strategic business ideas, let’s have a look at the price performance of the cable television industry when compared with the S&P 500 index. The cable television industry has gained 18.72% outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 13.7%, over the past one year.Some of the major cable television companies, which are scheduled to release their second-quarter 2017 earnings, are Comcast Corp., Charter Communications, Shaw Communications Inc. (SJR  -  Free Report) and Liberty Global plc. (LBTYA  -  Free Report).On Jun 28, Shaw Communications reported an impressive financial result for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended May 31, 2017) wherein the bottom line and top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Comcast Corp. and Charter Communications will report their results on Jul 27, before the market opens. Liberty Global plans to release its numbers on Aug 7, after the market closes. We look forward to see how these cable companies, which are yet to release their quarterly earnings, will perform.An Overview of Q2 Earnings So Far We have just entered the second-quarter earnings season with results from 30 S&P 500 members that account for 9.3% of the index’s total market capitalization (based on our latest Earnings Preview article). Total earnings for these companies are up 13.8% from the year-ago period on 6% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and a similar portion beating revenue estimates.This week will see more than 200 companies reporting results, including 68 S&P 500 members. We can state that the second-quarter earnings season is off to a good start. By the end of this week, we will have results from almost one-fifth of the S&P 500 members.Q2 Expectations (as a whole & sector specific)For second-quarter, we anticipate the prospects of companies to improve steadily. In fact, our latest scorecard projects that total Q2 earnings are expected to be up 6.6% from the year-ago period on 4.5% higher revenues. This would follow 13.3% increase in earnings growth from first quarter on 7.0% revenues growth, recording the highest increase in almost two years.We predict that second-quarter earnings of the Consumer Discretionary space to be down 1.6% in the quarter on 7.8% higher revenues in the year-ago period.Cable TV Stocks’ Expected Q2 Earnings Release on Jul 20Our quantitative model offers some insight into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model,  a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to deliver earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Meanwhile, we also caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Investors interested in cable TV stocks can watch out for the two cable companies that are expected to report their second-quarter 2017 numbers, before the opening bell on Jul 20.Headquartered in Canada, Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI  -  Free Report) is one of the largest integrated telecom operator in the region.

904,CHTR,"Research firm, Dataxis recently reported that the U.S. pay-TV subscriber base has declined by 612,000 to 100.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. This indicates a fall of 0.61% year over year. Cable TV subscriber base remains almost flat at 58.4 million. However, satellite TV customer base was down 1.32% to 33.2 million and IPTV customer base declined 3.1% to 6.3 million. On the other hand low-cost OTT (over the top) pay-TV service grew 6% to 2.4 million subscribers.Research firm, SNL Kagan recently predicted that the U.S. pay-TV industry (consisting of cable, satellite and IPTV operators) will lose approximately 10.8 million customers by 2021. Total pay-TV subscribers will be around 82.3 million at that time, which will be 20% less than the industry’s historical high level.In terms of customer retention, legacy pay-TV operators are yet to cope with the onslaught of low-cost online video streaming service providers. In the last ten years, the internal dynamics of the pay-TV market have gradually shifted from legacy pay-TV offerings to low-cost OTT service providers.The strong presence of online video streaming providers is posing a significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable TV operators, seems to be slipping out of their hands fast.In order to remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering internet TV with selected TV channels at cheap rate. Technically, internet TV is similar to pay-TV offerings. Its shows can be viewed using a broadband connection and mobile gadgets like tablets, smartphones, Roku box and smart TV, to name a few.In the U.S. cable TV operators command over 50% of pay-TV market share. They are followed by satellite TV (nearly 33%), IPTV (6%) and OTT (2%). AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) holds 25% of market share (including DIRECTV, DIRECTV Now and U-Verse), followed by Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) with a 23% share and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) with a share of 17%. Recently, Charter Communications rejected a $100 billion takeover bid from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report).AT&T currently hold s a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while the rest of stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

905,CHTR,"Shares of Sprint (S  -  Free Report) rallied in afternoon trading on Friday, closing the day up 4.27% to $8.55 a share after reports that Sprint executives have engaged Warren Buffett and John Malone about possible investments in the telecommunications company.Sprint chairman Masayoshi Son met separately with Berkshire Hathaway  CEO Warren Buffett and Liberty Media’s  John Malone. The talks are in the early stages, but Berkshire could put more than $10 billion into a potential deal.Berkshire Hathaway has made other large investments recently. Last month, Berkshire invested $1.5 billion to Home Capital, a Canadian mortgage company. And just days ago, Berkshire Hathaway offered $9 billion to buy Energy Future Holdings.Buffett and Malone aren’t the only ones talking to Sprint about potential deals. T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report) has expressed interest in Sprint, and the companies were in talks during May. T-Mobile’s CFO, J. Braxton Carter, has said that a merger would benefit both companies mutually.In late June, Sprint was also in talks with Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report) and Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) for a potential deal. Both cable companies are reportedly interested in offering wireless services on their networks.Only time will tell if one or all of these deals will go through for Sprint.S remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Sprint is set to report its next quarterly earnings on July 24.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

906,CHTR,"After a six-week trial, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. This will give the pay-TV provider an ownership of cable channels such as HBO and CNN as well as film studio Warner Bros. AT&T vowed to close the deal by Jun 20.  This long-awaited decision will change the landscape of the media industry by setting the stage for mergers of media companies and telecom providers. Cable operator, Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has also been eyeing  the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA for as much as $60 billion, should regulators approve AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner.The expected move would create a bidding war for The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets of Fox for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. The acquisition of Fox assets will enhance the streaming and television content of both Comcast and Disney and pose a significant threat to growing digital rivals like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, Comcast would become the biggest player in Hollywood by acquiring Fox (read: Comcast Might Thwart Disney-Fox Deal: Media ETFs in Focus).Fox’s film production business includes Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Searchlight and Fox 2000, and the highest grossing Marvel movies - X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool. Fox TV film studio includes This Is Us, Modern Family, and The Simpsons, regional sports networks and entertainment cable channels like National Geographic, FX Networks, Fox Sports Regional Networks, as well as international networks like Star India, a controlling stake in Hulu, and a 39% stake of European satellite provider, Sky.The ruling has also opened doors for AT&T’s biggest rival Verizon Communication (VZ  -  Free Report) to bid for a media company. The potential target of Verizon is the combined CBS Corp (CBS  -  Free Report) and Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report). Other media stocks like Charter Communications CHTR, Dish Network (DISH  -  Free Report), and Discovery DISCA are also in the spotlight in light of the merger mania.Additionally, the verdict has spread optimism beyond the media space as well. It would aid the proposed T-Mobile/Sprint (S  -  Free Report) combination and a pair of significant healthcare deals. This includes the potential buyout of the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna AET by a drug chain CVS Health Corp CVS and the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding ESRX by Cigna (C  -  Free Report)I) (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).How to Play?Investors seeking to capitalize on the upcoming boom in M&A activities and potential reshaping of the media industry should consider any of the following ETFs:IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF MNA This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge.

This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has key holdings in financials, healthcare and technology.

907,CHTR,"Adversity makes strange bedfellows or in this case competition. Rewinding 7-8 years, telecom and cable operators were jostling and vying for a share of each other’s territory with media industry acting as a content supply chain to both.Cut to now, fierce competition from tech behemoths have completely altered the market landscape, compelling telecom, cable TV and media operators to band together in order to survive.Competition Intensifies in Telecom SpaceU.S. telecom market is witnessing cut-throat pricing competition. Two large incumbents — Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) — are bearing the brunt of this competition.Consolidation of wireless industry, entry of cable TV giants like Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) and the decision of tech behemoths like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) to foray into the telecom space has intensified the competitionPay-TV Industry Facing Survival Threat  Exponential growth of mobile data usage supported by flourishing high-end smartphone and tablet devices, has altered the entire dynamics of the traditional pay-TV industry.Consumer preference has shifted from costlier legacy cable TV connections to low-cost over-the-top (OTT) video streaming service, resulting in significant cord cutting. Tech giants Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) are the two leading Internet TV streaming service providers.Digital Platform: The Next Battle FieldIn order to derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform, telecom, cable TV and media operators are aggressively penetrating the digital advertising technology market. Inclusions of dynamic ad-insertion, targeted audience advertising and data-driven TV advertisements are steps toward the same objective.This advertising platform is designed to monetize applications for publishers and developers through the use of data-driven ad targeting. Currently, tech behemoths like Alphabet, Facebook and Twiter are major beneficiaries of digital advertisements.Integration of Telecom-Cable TV-Media: A Survival StrategyRapid technological advancement is systematically redefining the parameters of the telecom, cable TV and media industries. Vertical integration of distribution and content creation will create a unique platform to serve any sort of communications, broadcasting along with a vast area of entertainment industry.Consider the case of AT&T, which recently received court’s approval to acquire Time Warner Inc.  in $85.4 billion deal. AT&T will now have nationwide high-speed mobile and broadband network, online TV streaming services, a large TV broadcasting network, HBO assets and film production network.This is definitely a ploy to take on the challenges of Silicon Valley tech behemoths.

908,CHTR,"The Net Neutrality laws, which were repealed by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) on Dec 14, 2017, finally received the death knell on Jun 11. The newly constructed FCC under Trump administration with Ajit Pai at the helm rescinded the Obama-era open-Internet rules. Notably, the rules had altered the dynamics of the Internet Service Providers (ISP) industry.Following the abandonment of Net Neutrality, the regulator’s sole concern will be transparency of ISP practices by ensuring that consumers can buy service plans best suited to them. Further, large and SMB (small and medium business) enterprises can avail instant technical information for product innovation. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) will be in charge of overseeing ISP practices for the protection of consumers’ online privacy.Proponents of Net NeutralityThe champions of Net Neutrality argued that strong regulatory measures are required to ensure free availability of Internet to everyone. If ISPs are allowed to practice paid prioritization, a method through which content developers strike deals with ISPs for fast and smooth transmission of their data traffic, then only a handful of large web-based content and application developers will benefit.This will have a negative impact on start-ups resulting in less innovation and competition. General consumers will also be affected since established content and application developers will ultimately raise their price to recoup the extra charge they pay to the ISPs.Opponents of Net NeutralityMeanwhile, Net Neutrality adversaries argued that market equilibrium is achieved when marginal utility equalizes marginal cost. If multi-media application generates more demand than simple text message, users need to pay accordingly. If an application requires more bandwidth consumption, then the users should pay more for that.In the last 20 years, private sector has invested a mammoth $1.5 trillion to install communications network throughout the United States. This enormous expenditure took place primarily due to not-so-stringent rules implemented by the regulator. Due to this exponential deployment of telecom network, the web-based applications and solutions developers are flourishing.Who Will Gain as U.S. Bids Adieu to Net Neutrality?There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after United States officially dismantling Net Neutrality. Leading ISPs including AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) strongly criticized Net Neutrality rules. All four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows price performance of major ISPs in the last three months. Who Will Lose as Net Neutrality is Revoked?Implementation of Net Neutrality was a huge positive for several web-based application and content developers. Consequently, Internet-based tech giants and content developers will be major losers after the FCC revoked Net Neutrality rules. Netflix Inc., Google of Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Hulu, Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. are a few of the companies in the same league.Bottom LineTelecommunications is a necessary utility. Net Neutrality may discourage large investments in the telecom sector but will cut down the cost of online access for end-users since content providers will no longer need to pay extra fees. However, it is to be seen how the government manages a trade-off between the two.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

909,CHTR,"The U.S. postpaid wireless market continues to witness intense pricing competition. Uninterrupted advancement in wireless technologies has aided telecom operators to adopt newer business models in order to stay in the game. Notably, postpaid wireless customers are those who are billed monthly and considered more profitable to telecom operators.Technological upgrades and breakthroughs have resulted in cutthroat price competition. Product life-cycle and upgrade-cycle have been reduced drastically as several firms are coming up with new products and services within a short span of time. Increasing competition is compelling players to offer heterogeneous and bundled services to retain market share.Disappointing Start in 2018After a lackluster 2017, the U.S. wireless service operators have failed to turn their fortune around in 2018 so far. Year to date, the share price of all four major wireless operators – Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) – declined 8.5%, 14.1%, 9.3% and 11.2%, respectively.Intensified pricing competition resulting in lower ARPU (average revenue per user) and margins, massive investment for upcoming 5G wireless network and fiber optic buildout resulting in low free cash flow and severe competitive pressure compelled the investor’s to shift focus on other growth-oriented industries.Industry Consolidation Ever since President Trump came to power, the telecom industry circle has been rife with speculations that the Trump administration may pave the way for consolidation of the U.S. wireless industry. The previous Obama regime was very firm on the issue of consolidation by not allowing the number of national wireless service providers to decrease below four in order to eliminate monopolistic power.However, the newly restructured Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under Trump’s presidency has given enough indications of its leniency compared with the Obama administration. Consequently, on April 2018, T-Mobile US and Sprint decided to merge their businesses.If the deal finally sees light of the day, both T-Mobile US and Sprint will benefit significantly. At present, Verizon and AT&T together control around 68% of the U.S. wireless market. The merged entity of T-Mobile US and Sprint with around 32% market share will be a formidable challenger to both Verizon and AT&T.Entry of New PlayersLargest cable MSO (multi service operator) and media behemoth Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has already forayed into this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering. Presently, the company is utilizing its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon to use the latter’s wireless network along with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services.Another cable giant Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) is reportedly inching closer to launch Spectrum Mobile wireless services. Like Comcast, the company has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services.Additionally, Comcast has acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. Charter Communications has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network. These trials come on the back of spectrum test licenses granted to it by the FCC. Moreover, both the companies have formed a partnership for software and backend systems needed to support the two mobile networks.Both Comcast and Charter Communications carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The chart below shows year-to-date price performance of six stocks mentioned above.Bottom LineThe U.S. telecom market continues to witness intense pricing competition, as success to a great extent depends on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability. Competition is likely to increase further in the U.S. wireless industry in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs. Moreover, the proposed merger of T-Mobile US and Sprint will only worsen the situation for incumbents like Verizon and AT&T.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics.

910,CHTR,"On May 23, Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report) said that it is in the process of preparing a superior all-cash offer for the assets of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) that The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) has already shown interest in. Understandably, broadcasters are trying to make their international presence stronger given the stiff competition they are facing from streaming giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), which are fast invading their space and changing the entire ballgame.Interestingly, Netflix briefly surpassed Disney in market value on May 24 wining the crown of the most valuable media company in the world. Against this backdrop, as Comcast prepares for a formal all-cash offer, it now needs to be seen where Fox finally builds its new den.Comcast to Gain From Fox Acquisition Comcast heated up the acquisition war on May 23 after announcing that it is in the final stages of preparing a fresh all-cash offer of an estimated $60 billion to buy the assets of Fox. Rupert Murdoch’s Fox last year had agreed to sell it film and television studios, FX Networks, National Geographic and other cable assets to Disney in a $52.4 billion deal.Before entering into a deal with Disney, Fox had rejected Comcast’s offer to buy its assets, citing it as too risky although the bid was higher. However, Comcast’s recent announcement is a fresh challenge to both Fox and Disney, as they gear up to take their deal to shareholders this summer.This is because, Fox might feel optimistic about the deal after recent indications that a judge might rule in favor of the Time Warner Inc  and AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) merger. The decision is expected on Jun 12 and a positive outcome might ease regulatory concerns and boost Comcast’s confidence in making an official offer.Comcast has graduated from a cable television giant to a diversified media company. Taking over Fox makes sense to Comcast at a time when its rivals are scaling up. Charter Communication, Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) is aggressively working on mobile expansion, while AT&T’s bid to buy out Time Warner is in a move to enhance its pay TV and digital content. Given this scenario, taking over Fox will only strengthen Comcast’s broadcasting arm.Disney Still Favored by FoxDespite Comcast announcing its plans of making a fresh all-cash deal to Fox, Murdoch’s company is in favor of Disney because an all-stock offer will save the company from coughing up a huge tax amount. Whereas, an all-cash deal will make Fox pay up huge tax. Also, Disney has a bigger brand and global presence than Comcast and at the same time many of Fox’s parts are a perfect fit with Disney’s strengths.   Moreover, a Fox-Disney is unlikely to face regulatory problems that a Fox-Comcast deal bears the risk of. From Disney’s perspective too, Fox is a lucrative acquisition given that it is facing increased competition from the likes of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon. Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Disney also has plans of removing its content from Netflix in 2018. Given this scenario, acquiring Fox would add muscle to Disney’s broadcasting arm, as the deal will help it to get its film studio content, Fox TV, FX networks and National Geographic Channel.The Bigger War The biggest story amid all these bids and counter bids is the growing competition from streaming giants. Broadcasters have realized that tech companies with their digital content are giving them a run for their money and the only way to stay in the race is by expanding and diversifying their content.In fact, Netflix has already said that it will dedicate $8 billion in 2018 solely to content. Comcast’s recent decision to add Netflix to its bundled offering further proves the growing demand and preference for online content. Although it too early to predict a winner, it makes sense for broadcasting giants to diversify their portfolio to survive the onslaught of streaming giants.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

911,CHTR,"The U.S. Senate will vote in the coming week as a last ditch attempt  to save the Net Neutrality laws which were repealed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Dec 14, 2017. The newly constructed FCC under Trump administration with Ajit Pai at the helm repealed the Obama-era rules which altered the dynamics of the Internet Service Providers (ISP) industry.Senate Democrats are hopeful to win the vote regarding the restoration of Net Neutrality. However, the same needs to be approved by the House of Representative and finally by the President himself, who can veto Net Neutrality even if the bill is cleared by both the houses.Controversy Over Net NeutralityThe champions of Net Neutrality argued that strong regulatory measures are required to ensure free availability of Internet to everyone. If ISPs are allowed to practice paid prioritization, a method through which content developers strike deals with ISPs for fast and smooth transmission of their data traffic, then only a handful of large web-based content and application developers will benefit.This will have a negative impact on start-up companies resulting in less innovation and competition. General consumers will also be affected since established content and application developers will ultimately raise their price to recoup the extra charge they pay to the ISPs.Meanwhile, opponents of Net Neutrality argued that market equilibrium is achieved when marginal utility equalizes marginal cost. If multi-media application generates more demand than simple text message, users need to pay accordingly. If an application requires more bandwidth consumption, then the users should pay more for that.Several billion dollars of investment for high-speed broadband network which the ISP’s spend will be significantly jeopardized if discriminatory pricing is disallowed and it would eventually result in loss of jobs for the economy.Who Will Gain if Net Neutrality Returns?Implementation of Net Neutrality by FCC was a huge positive for several web-based application and content developers. Internet-based tech giants and content developers are the major beneficiaries of Net Neutrality rules. Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Google of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Hulu, Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) are a few of the companies in the same league.Who Will Lose if Net Neutrality is Recalled? There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major losers if Net Neutrality staged a comeback. Leading ISPs including AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) strongly criticized Net Neutrality rules.Each of Netflix, Alphabet, Facebook, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Amazon and Twitter sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chart below shows price performnace of all above mentioned stocks in the last three months.Bottom Line Telecommunications is a necessary utility. Net Neutrality may discourage large investments in the telecom sector but will cut down the cost of online access for end-users since content providers will no longer need to pay extra fees. However, it is to be seen how the government manages a trade-off between the two.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

914,CHTR,"The broadcast war is not only intensifying but also becoming increasingly complicated. Making the scenario more complex, Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), on Wednesday, made a $31-billion offer to take over Sky plc (SKYAY  -  Free Report), which raises the specter for a potential bidding war between Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) and the cable television giant. Fox had earlier offered $16.5 billion to take over the remaining assets of Sky.Understandably, every broadcaster is trying to increase its international presence with acquisitions, to stay ahead in the race. In fact, The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) in Dec 2017 cut a $52.4-billion deal to acquire Fox’s television and film studios, FX Networks, National Geographic and other cable assets.It goes without saying that broadcasters are trying to make their international presence stronger given the stiff competition they are facing from streaming giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), which are fast invading their space and changing the entire ballgame. As the bidding war starts, it now needs to be seen, which players finally gets bigger share of the pie.Comcast Gears Up for Global PresenceComcast has graduated from a cable television giant to a diversified media company. Its recent $31-billion bid to take over Sky proves that the company now plans to expand and make its international presence felt. In fact, in late February, Comcast had expressed its desire to take over the assets of Sky, which Fox is eyeing as well. Interestingly, Fox holds a 39% stake in Sky and had made a $16.5-billion offer to buy the remaining stake in the company in 2016.Understandably, this will only result in a potential bidding war between the two companies. Sky is a lucrative property given its 23-million strong subscriber foothold in Europe. And taking over such a prized company will only add to Comcast’s broadcasting, comprising NBCUniversal, which has an eclectic mix of news, entertainment and sports content.Moreover, Sky, which holds the rights of British Premiere League in the U.K., extended the U.S. television rights to NBCSports through 2022 in February. Naturally, a deal with Sky will help Comcast get broader access to the international market. Sky plc has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Taking over Sky makes sense to Comcast at a time when its rivals are scaling up. Charter Communication, Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) is aggressively working on mobile expansion, while AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) is also planning to buy out Time Warner Inc.  to enhance its pay TV and digital content. Given this scenario, taking over Sky will only strengthen Comcast’s broadcasting arm.Broadcasting ConundrumComcast’s formal bid to take over Sky has definitely made the entire broadcasting war more complex, as almost all the industry giants are trying to expand. Walt Disney in Dec 2017 entered into a deal to acquire Fox television and film studios, FX Networks, National Geographic and other cable assets. Understandably, this deal was a move to increase the company’s global presence in broadcasting. However, a few lucrative assets such as Fox News and Fox Broadcasting were left out.Fox, on the other hand, had placed an offer to buy out the remaining 61% stake in Sky. In fact, Sky’s independent directors had recommended that the company’s shareholders accept Fox’s offer. However, with Comcast making a bid, Sky’s directors have withdrawn their recommendation.Undoubtedly, Comcast has now put both Disney and Fox in a complicated situation, first and foremost because it automatically increases the stake for Disney’s bid for Fox. Moreover, if Fox doesn’t get into the bidding war, Disney might bid for Sky separately, as it had previously indicated. This is more so because Disney’s CEO Bob Iger had long expressed his desire to buy Sky calling it “the crown jewel.”On the other hand, for Fox, acquiring Sky is more an emotional decision, given that Rupert Murdoch had founded the satellite broadcaster in 1990 and already holds a 39% stake.The Real CompetitionThe biggest story amid all these bids and counter bids is the growing competition from streaming giants. Broadcasters have realized that tech companies with their digital content are giving them a run for their money and the only way to stay in the race is by expanding and diversifying their content.In fact, Netflix has already said that it will spend $8 billion in 2018 just only on content. Comcast’s recent decision to add Netflix to its bundled offering is further proves the growing demand and preference for online content. Although it too early to predict a winner, it makes sense for broadcasting giants to diversify their portfolio to survive the onslaught of streaming giants.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

919,CHTR,"U.S. wireless tower operators had a dream run in 2017. American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) was certainly one of the major beneficiaries. We believe there are a number of reasons for this stellar show to continue in 2018. We will discuss the reasons in short.Upcoming 5G Wireless NetworkFifth-generation (5G) superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In September 2017, Moody's Investors Service stated in a report that the evolution towards 5G wireless networks will result in higher capital spending for U.S. wireless carriers. In this context, Internet-of-Things (IoT) holds the potential of becoming the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Strong Business ModelWireless services are advancing fast in terms of additional features and capabilities. Much of the infrastructure and upgrades require effective site management of cell towers and equipment. Tower operators effectively address this opportunity as more than 90% of its quarterly revenues come from wireless carriers. Tower operators generally have long-term (typically 5 -10 years) tower lease agreements with the U.S. national carriers.Moreover, wireless consumer demand is expected to increase considerably over the next several years, driven by increased innovation and adoption of data-driven mobile devices and applications such as machine-to-machine (M2M) connections, social networking and streaming of video.Importantly, American Tower has a highly diversified business model. Apart from its leadership position in the United States, the company has a strong foothold in Asia (especially in India), Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. In 2016, American Tower generated 41% of its total revenues from outside homeland. Management expects international revenues to top U.S. sales in next three to seven years.American Tower is highly enthusiastic about its India operation where the company already controls over 58,000 towers. In November, 2017, American Tower entered into an agreement to buy about 20,000 towers from Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian business and Idea Cellular Ltd., for approximately $1.2 billion. The tenancy ratio is expected to rise to 2.9 times by March 2020, from about the 1.95 times average for India in 2015.Massive Spectrum Deployment by U.S. CarriersWireless networks will be integral to the future growth of the overall telecom industry. T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has aggressively started deploying 600 MHz low-band airwaves. This year, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) will deploy 60 MHz of fallow spectrum and 600 MHz low-band spectrum coupled with its ongoing network densification project.Moreover, AT&T will also install its FirstNet project to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers. The company will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network.Additionally, major U.S. telecom operators are exploring ways to commercialize usage of 3.5 GHz unlicensed wireless spectrum. Notably, the 3.5 GHz radio frequency is being considered in many parts of the world for the upcoming 5G wireless standard, thus increasing its chances of providing spectrum globally.Entry of New Players in the U.S. Wireless SpaceThe U.S. wireless industry is likely to get competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi service operators) in this space. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has already entered this field with its Xfinity Mobile offering. At present the company is using its MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon to use the latter’s wireless network coupled with its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. Importantly, the company acquired 73 licenses in the band of 600 MHz auctioned by the FCC. We believe that in the future Comcast will deploy this spectrum for extensive wireless coverage.Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) has reiterated its plans of launching wireless service in the first half of next year. Similar to Comcast, the company also has an MVNO agreement with Verizon as well as its own WiFi network to offer mobile services. It has also launched experimental field trials of the 5G wireless network.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) has created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks. The company boasts a portfolio of 80 MHz of radio frequencies of different bands, which will be utilized in deploying 4G LTE wireless network in top 100 U.S. markets. DISH Network’s CEO Charlie Ergen has hinted that the company is interested in the potential deal-making to enter the wireless industry. At the same time, Ergen also stated that DISH Network has plans of building a wireless network on its own.Strong FundamentalsAmerican Tower has strong fundamentals.

920,CHTR,"On Dec 27, Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Charter Communications is the second largest cable multi service operator (MSO) in the United States after Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report).Let’s have a look at the catalysts that led to the stock’s upgradation.Bullish Developments Charter Communications intends to venture in the U.S. wireless industry with the launch of wireless services in 2018. Notably, the company inked an agreement with national telecom behemoth Verizon Communications to operate as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). The company will utilize Verizon’s wireless network along with its WiFi network to offer mobile services. On May 8, Charter Communications and Comcast announced their joint wireless venture to better explore their opportunities, accelerate and enhance each other’s ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace.Charter Communications has plans to execute field trials for the upcoming 5G wireless network. Notably, these trials were backed by spectrum test licenses granted to the company by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the U.S. telecom regulator.The twin buyout of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks have strengthened the company’s foothold in hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and fiber networks. The company is adopting various initiatives to improve Spectrum products and cloud-based user interfaces.The company witnesses growth in residential and commercial internet as well as voice customer addition, which is evident from increase in revenues and subscriber gain. Further, investments in business services division and rollout of several initiatives will drive upcoming results.The company’s recent activities look promising and likely to add to its prospects.Charter’s Latest Deals On Dec 13, Altice USA, Charter Communications and Comcast announced a preliminary agreement to form a new Interconnect in the New York market. This will provide a one-stop advertising solution to reach more than 6.2 million households across the New York DMA — the largest advertising market in the country. For marketers, agencies and advertisers, the new Interconnect will provide an enhanced way to strategically reach audiences through TV and digital platforms. The Interconnect is expected to be launched in second-quarter 2018.On Dec 11, Charter Communications settled a year-long content licensing dispute with Univision Communications Inc. Per sources, Univision agreed to dismiss the case against Charter Communications. The companies have informed the court about the settlement. However, the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.On Nov 30, Charter Communications and Altice USA Inc (ATUS  -  Free Report) have reportedly inked an agreement to broadcast respective regional cable news networks. Per the deal, Charter will telecast i24NEWS, which was launched by Altice USA in January. The channel is available on Altice USA’s Optimum and Suddenlink systems. Meanwhile, Charter’s Spectrum News NY1 will be available to Optimum users in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.On Nov 15, Charter Communications and Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) announced a multi-year renewal and expansion deal of their distribution relationship. The companies formed an alliance for the co-production of original content and collaboration around advanced advertising.Price Performance The company portrays an impressive price performance backed by positive prospects, latest ventures and opportunities. On a year-to-date basis, the stock has returned 18.3% compared with the industry’s rally of 13.4%.  Estimates Trending UpWe note that the sales and Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimate for Charter Communications has moved up for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018.Sales growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 are estimated to rise 3.1% and 4.4%, respectively. For 2018, sales are expected to improve 4.9%.The EPS growth for fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter 2018 is estimated to increase 167.1% and 54.2%, respectively. For full-year 2018, EPS is expected to soar 150.6%.DownturnsDespite such positives, Charter Communications’ presence in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market is a concern. Like other cable operators, the company continues to lose subscribers to online video streaming service providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. Notably, in third-quarter 2017, the company lost 1,04,000 video customers in the residential segment. The company will continue to witness subscriber loss in the upcoming quarter as well.Further, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages. Moreover, the U.S. pay-TV industry is affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable-TV operators.Charter Communications’ high debt level is a potential hazard. At the end of the third quarter, the company had $2,164 million of cash and cash equivalents and $68,132 million of outstanding debt compared with $1,535 million and $62,464 million, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. The debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of the reported quarter was 0.61 compared with 0.54 at the end of 2016.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

922,CHTR,"In a landmark decision on Dec 14, the FCC repealed Net Neutrality laws which came into force under the Obama administration. The move was in the offing ever since Ajit Pai was appointed the FCC’s chairman earlier this year. Pai, a staunch Net Neutrality opponent, has always maintained that consumers would be worse off under Net Neutrality and should expect their bills to go up along with slower broadband speeds.The move is expected to significantly impact individual consumers with several interest groups organizing demonstrations against such a move. Interestingly enough, major Internet powers such as Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), which have been long term advocates for Net Neutrality, issued only muted protests on this occasion.  It seems that though you may be worried about your Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) account stalling in such a scenario, the streaming giant may emerge virtually unscathed.ISPs Emerge as Big WinnersCheering the move to end Net Neutrality rules were the likes of AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report). This is because ISPs are expected to hugely benefit in the post Net Neutrality era. They will now be able to implement discriminatory pricing for utilizing different parts of the Internet.Further, they will be able to indulge in data traffic blocking and traffic slowdowns. Paid prioritization is also likely to become a common practice. This is a method through which content developers strike deals with ISPs for fast and smooth transmission of their data traffic. (Read: FCC's Net Neutrality Rules: Who Benefits the Most?)Why Has Netflix Issued Muted Protests?In the past, major Internet companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) have been vocal supporters of the Obama era Net Neutrality rules. However, reactions from these quarters have been extremely muted on this occasion with the likes of Netflix choosing to comment only when the rollback finally happened. And yet only three years ago, it was the poster boy for Netflix champions. The reason for this is that in the intervening period, Netflix has grown into an online giant with revenues poised to hit the $12 billion mark this year. Clearly, it now doesn’t need those Net Neutrality rules as badly as it did before. Conversely, ISPs urgently need the 53 million U.S. subscribers it provides, most of whom are hooked onto the likes of Stranger Things and The Crown.  Netflix has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, Netflix has the deep pockets to afford any paid prioritization for its services. And it’s clear from the revenue and subscriber numbers that it can negotiate hard for favorable rates in such an event. The next Netflix or any other number of sundry startups for that matter may not find the going that smooth. They would have to incur high costs to ensure that their services reach their end users smoothly. Can the Stock Deliver Strong Gains in 2018?The undisputed king of original content has made further strides in this area in 2017. Netflix is planning to spend almost $8 billion on producing its own content next year. This is a substantial jump from the $6 billion that it spent on content in 2017. Rapid international expansion has also paid off, with the company adding 4.45 million net new subscribers overseas in the quarter, higher than the estimated 3.65 million.With the stock gaining a searing 52.5% year to date, the only factor working against it at this point is valuations. With a PEG ratio of 3.13, Netflix is clearly pricier than the S&P 500, which has a PEG ratio of 2.01. However, it is still much less exorbitant than arch rival Amazon, which has a PEG ratio of 7.01.Also, the ongoing market rally has dispelled such concerns over valuation time and time again. Tech majors have delivered ever stronger earnings performances, as was in evidence during Netflix’s third quarter results, to justify such exorbitant valuations.In ConclusionNetflix is likely to remain largely unscathed from an end to Net Neutrality. In fact, it is likely to surge even higher in 2018 on the back of its strong original content and international subscriber additions. This makes it a great option for investors going forward.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

923,CHTR,"Last week was pretty eventful for the telecom industry. In a landmark decision, the U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime. There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the biggest beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality.Leading ISPs including AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) strongly criticized Net Neutrality rules. Nevertheless, Net Neutrality supporters are preparing for a legal battle. We expect this subject to remain a hot cake in the 2018 telecom space.Meanwhile, the third largest wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) is set to unveil its online TV steaming service in 2018 after its recent deal to acquire Denver–based video technology innovator Layer3 TV Inc. Denver-based Layer3 TV combines TV, streaming online video content and social media content under one platform. It can also transmit HD video at a bandwidth of less than 4 megabits per second. T-Mobile will leverage LTE network speeds and Layer3 TV’s technology to roll out streaming TV service.AT&T and media giant Time Warner Inc.  are finally heading for a battle in court against the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2018 over their $85.4 billion big-ticket merger deal. On Nov 20, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against the telecom behemoth over its mega acquisition deal. AT&T will challenge the DOJ verdict in court. However, a court ruling is unlikely to come before May 2018. Notably, both the companies have resettled the closing date for the deal at Apr 20, 2018.AT&T recently shared information on a tentative deal with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) in relation with AT&T Mobility Orange unit employees. Announced on Dec 13, the four-year contract covers more than 20,000 AT&T Mobility employees (in wireless retail, call center and tech segments) in 36 states and the District of Columbia. AT&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, the company has raised its quarterly dividend by 2% to 50 cents per share (annualized $2.00 per share). Sanctioned by the company’s board of directors, the dividend will be paid on Feb 1, 2017 to shareholders of record as of Jan 10. This marks the 34th annual dividend increase by the company.Verizon recently completed the $225-million purchase of fiber-optic network assets from WideOpenWest, Inc. (WOW  -  Free Report) in the Chicago area. Per the terms of the deal, Verizon will pay WideOpenWest an additional $50 million to complete Chicago network build in second-half 2018. The amount will increase to $275 million at the time of completion.Read the last Telecom Stock Roundup for Dec 14, 2017.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories  1.    The primary issue related to the Net Neutrality controversy is that can high-speed broadband (Internet) be treated as public utility like phone, electricity, gas, water etc. Telecom is a major infrastructure product. Can Internet be classified as an essential service for livelihood for which the bulk of the investment is coming from private sector? Net Neutrality laws reclassified Internet as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The reclassification is associated with strong control mechanism. (Read more: FCC Bids Adieu to Net Neutrality - Legal Battle Looms)2.    Internet-TV streaming service is gaining market traction gradually in the United States. Recently, the legacy pay-TV industry has been facing stiff competition from online video streaming service providers such as Netflix, Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. The low-cost over-the-top (OTT) video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting, which is currently threatening the pay-TV business model. (Read more: T-Mobile US to Launch OTT Service in 2018, Buy Layer3 TV)3.    AT&T’s growth in 2018 will largely depend on the court ruling on the Time Warner merger deal. If the court ruling goes against AT&T, three options will be available: either scrapping the deal, divesting its DIRECTV division, or acquiring Time Warner without the Turner Broadcasting assets including CNN. On the other hand, if the court ruling goes in AT&T’s favour, the merged entity will enjoy control over both high-quality content and distribution medium. (Read more: AT&T, Time Warner Fail to Settle Acquisition Talks with DOJ)4.    Accumulation of dark fiber will bolster Verizon’s cell network density, which will consequently boost mobile backhaul network. Dark fiber provides abundant bandwidth and is extremely importance for the smooth functioning of super-fast wireless networks like 4G and 5G. Dark fiber-based backhaul provides scalability and efficiency to bandwidth management. This will eventually help the company to significantly reduce backhaul costs. (Read more: Verizon Acquires WideOpenWest's Chicago Fiber Assets) 5.    AT&T claims that the dividend hike was backed by the company’s strong cash flows and business outlook. In third-quarter 2017, AT&T generated $11,114 million of cash from operations compared with $10,995 million from the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow in the reported quarter was $5,863 million compared with $5,182 million in the year-ago quarter.

924,CHTR,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) recently announced a dividend hike. The move reflects the company’s commitment to create value for its shareholders and underlines its confidence in generating cash. Following the announcement, shares of the company have inched up 1.32% to $38.24 at the close of business on Dec 15.The company raised its quarterly dividend by 2% to 50 cents per share (annualized $2.00 per share). Sanctioned by the company’s board of directors, the dividend will be paid on Feb 1, 2017 to shareholders of record as of Jan 10. This marks the 34th annual dividend increase by the company.Meanwhile, Randall Stephenson, Chairman and CEO of AT&T, claims that the dividend hike was backed by the company’s strong cash flows and business outlook. In third-quarter 2017, AT&T generated $11,114 million of cash from operations compared with $10,995 million from the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow in the reported quarter was $5,863 million compared with $5,182 million in the year-ago quarter. Management expects free cash flow to be enough to pay debt and return cash to shareholders.HeadwindsAT&T has been grapplingin the competitive and saturated U.S. wireless market for long. Adoption of several unlimited data plans resulted in a reduction of wireless service revenues and average revenue per user (ARPU). The domestic wireless industry is likely to become more competitive in 2018 with the entry of cable MSOs (multi-service operators) like Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report). Regulatory issues continue to bother, evident from the pending AT&T -Time Warner Inc  deal deadline being extended for the third time to Apr 22, 2018. Competitive threat from online video streaming service providers is another major concern for its over-the-top (OTT) service — DIRECTV NOW. The company’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Moreover, AT&T portrays a disappointing price performance.

925,CHTR,"Yesterday, in a landmark decision, the U.S. telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed the Net Neutrality laws that it had imposed under the Obama regime.Ever since President Trump elected existing Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the chairman of the FCC in January 2017, the fate of Net Neutrality was at stake. Nevertheless, Net Neutrality supporters are preparing for legal battle. We expect this subject to remain a hot cake in the 2018 telecom space.On Feb 26, 2015, the FCC under the chairmanship of Tom Wheeler adopted Net Neutrality implying an open-Internet atmosphere, which will prohibit ISPs (Internet Service Providers), especially the telecom and cable TV operators, from discriminating against applications. So far, these companies were allowed to restrict any device, application, service, or content from running on their respective networks.Proponents of Net Neutrality argued that the law bans common ISP practices such as data traffic blocking, slowing any data traffic and paid prioritization. Content developers have to pay hefty sums to ISPs for accelerated data transfer, which they eventually transferred to end users. In this situation, implementation of Net Neutrality by FCC was a huge positive for several web-based application and content developers, especially the start-up companies and general consumers. (Read: FCC’s Net Neutrality Rules: Who Benefits the Most?)Opponents of Net Neutrality have argued that several billion dollars of investment for high-speed broadband network which the ISP’s spend will be significantly jeopardized if discriminatory pricing is disallowed and it would eventually result in loss of jobs for the economy. (Read: FCC Plans to Repeal Net Neutrality: Who Gains?)Irrespective of the arguments of the two sides, some important socio-economic policy related issues are also involved in the Net Neutrality controversy. We will now try to understand those:Is Internet a Public Utility Under Title II?The primary issue related to the Net Neutrality controversy is that can high-speed broadband (Internet) be treated as a public utility like phone, electricity, gas, water etc. Telecom is a major infrastructure product. Can Internet be classified as an essential service for livelihood for which the bulk of the investment is coming from private sector?Net Neutrality laws reclassified Internet as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The reclassification is associated with strong control mechanism.Importantly, these regulations were applicable to both mobile and fixed broadband networks. The reclassification of the Internet called for a radical change in the way the government treats high-speed broadband service. This gives the FCC increased control over the ISPs.Private Investment KeyIn the last 20 years, private sector has invested a mammoth $1.5 trillion to install communications network throughout the United States. A group of 63 smaller service providers, the majority of which serve rural areas, have given an estimate that they invest more than $70 billion every year on enhancing and expanding their networks, which raised rural broadband connectivity by a whopping 117% in the last 10 years.This enormous expenditure took place primarily due to not-so-stringent rules implemented by the regulator. Due to this exponential deployment of telecom network, the web-based applications and solutions developers are flourishing.Per a recent study by USTelecom, investment in broadband infrastructure declined from its peak at $78.4 billion in 2014 to $77.9 billion in 2015 and $76 billion in 2016. According to USTelecom, the reclassification of broadband as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act has resulted into precipitous lower investment in broadband infrastructure.Control Mechanism vs. Private InvestmentThe champions of Net Neutrality argued that strong regulatory measures are required to ensure free availability of Internet to everyone. If ISPs are allowed to practice paid prioritization, a method through which content developers strike deals with ISPs for fast and smooth transmission of their data traffic, then only a handful of large web-based content and application developers will benefit.This will have a negative impact on start-up companies resulting in less innovation and competition. General consumers will also be affected since established content and application developers will ultimately raise their price to recoup the extra charge they pay to the ISPs.On the other side, opponents of Net Neutrality argued that the basic rule of the neo-classical economic theory is left to itself the market will be able to bring back equilibrium. The equilibrium is achieved when marginal utility equalizes marginal cost. If multi-media application generates more demand than simple text message, users need to pay accordingly. Similarly, ISPs will reach equilibrium when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. If an application requires more bandwidth consumption, then the users should pay more for that.Moreover, establishing Internet fast lanes become necessary in some critical scenarios. Remote healthcare applications and self-driving cars will require high-speed secured broadband connections with exceptional reliability.In these situations, FCC’s soft regulatory policies will enable ISPs to better serve the nation. The current FCC's less-restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new merger and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies.Politics MattersLook at the voting pattern of the FCC when it adopted Net Neutrality and when it abandoned it. On both occasions, the result was 3-2. The Democrats were at the helm of FCC when the regulatory body adopted Net Natality, while Republicans are in power now. Ajit Pai strongly argued that a light-touch regulatory measure generated higher investment in the overall telecom industry.  Even when the former FCC under the chairmanship of Wheeler adopted Net Neutrality, Republican senators were not in favor of this directive. These groups believe that a slight law reformation under section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act will be enough to enforce Net Neutrality.Trump himself is a strong critic of Net Neutrality. He has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during this term as the President. A new FCC headed by Pai, exercising lesser restrictions, certainly augurs well for the ISP industry.The regulator’s sole concern will be transparency of ISP practices. This will ensure that consumers can buy service plans best suited to them. Also both large and SMB (small and medium business) enterprises can avail instant technical information for product innovation. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will be in charge overseeing ISP practices for the protection of consumers’ online privacy.Who Will Gain as FCC Revokes Net Neutrality?There is little doubt that the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary after FCC dismantling Net Neutrality. Leading ISPs including AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) strongly criticised Net Neutrality rules. AT&T carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). However, Verizon, Comcast and Charter have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineThe primary viewpoint of Net Neutrality proponents is that choice of content should be left to the consumer. No discrimination should be allowed in treating contents. An open Internet should be the backbone for product innovation in a free-market environment.On the other hand, the opponents of Net Neutrality argue that a light-touch regulatory measure will generate higher investment in the overall telecom industry. That will pave the way for web-based service providers to flourish.We are waiting for a legal solution to this controversy in 2018.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

928,CHTR,"Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report) recently settled pending a year-long content licensing dispute with Univision Communications Inc. Per sources, Univision agreed to dismiss the case against Charter. The companies have informed the court about the settlement. However, the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.  Charter is the second-largest cable MSO in the United States. Univision is the largest TV broadcaster of Spanish language.In July 2016, Univision sued Charter over carriage licensing fees, post the twin buyout of Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Bright House LLC to become the second largest cable mult-service operator (MSO) in the United States. The parties were at conflict about whether Time Warner’s long-term deal with Univision was applicable to the merged entity.Notably, Time Warner had a long-term agreement with Univision till June 2022 at lower carriage fees than the prevailing market rates. Univision contended that since Time Warner no longer exists, Charter must sign a new deal at the prevailing rates. To this extent, Charter refused to enter into any carriage renewal agreement.

929,CHTR,"Per a recent FierceCable report, traditional pay-TV services, including cable and satellite, in the United States lost 1.2 million customers in third-quarter 2017, thanks to cord cutting.Estimates by several research firms like Kagan and Leichtman Research Group have provided us with key findings for the reported quarter.The largest pay-TV providers lost about 405,000 net video subscribers compared with a loss of about 250,000 subscribers in the year-ago quarter. Major cable companies lost about 290,000 video subscribers in the quarter under review compared with a loss of around 90,000 in the prior-year quarter. Satellite-TV services lost approximately 475,000 subscribers in the reported quarter as against the addition of about 5,000 subscribers in third-quarter 2016.In the first nine months of 2017, cable companies lost 801,000 video customers — reflecting a 114% rise year over year.Total U.S. traditional pay-TV subscribers stand at approximately 91.7 million.U.S. Pay-TV IndustryIn the last 3-4 years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable-TV operators to large telecom operators and low-cost over-the-top (OTT) service providers. Extensive network of fiber-based video services from telecom operators and the strong presence of online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX), Hulu.com and YouTube etc. have become a threat to cable-TV operators. These online video streaming channels provide an extremely cheap source of TV. This business model is gaining momentum, even during economic uncertainties, and has proven to be a risk to the pay-TV industry.The industry has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators and online streaming service providers. Leading cable multi service operator (MSO) and media giant, Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) Cable business is suffering from subscriber loss despite the solid performance of the NBC Universal segment. The company added a net of 214,000 high-speed Internet customers and 51,000 security and automation customers, but lost 94,000 voice customers and 125,000 video customers in the reported quarter.Charter Communications Inc.’s (CHTR  -  Free Report) commercial segment also fared well, which is evident from the revenue and subscriber growth in the reported quarter. However, the company lost 104,000 video customers in the residential segment. It is the second-largest cable MSO after Comcast.The domestic multi-channel video market has also become extremely saturated and intensely competitive. Moreover, the U.S. pay-TV industry is affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable-TV operators.In order to cope up with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering Internet-TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates.Telecom and pay-TV behemoth, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), had 25.083 million video subscribers (down 0.8% year over year) as of Sep 30. Of the total, Satellite connections tallied 20.605 million, down 0.8%. U-verse connections were 3.691 million, down 18.3%. DIRECTV NOW connections were 0.787 million. In the reported quarter, AT&T lost 251,000 satellite-TV customers and 134,000 U-verse TV customers. However, it witnessed an addition of 296,000 DIRECTV NOW connections. DIRECTV NOW is the OTT online streaming service of AT&T.DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report), the second-largest satellite TV operator in the United States, gained a net of 16,000 pay-TV subscribers as against the loss of 116,000 in the year-ago quarter. Total pay-TV subscribers declined to 13.203 million compared with 13.643 million at the end of third-quarter 2016. In the reported quarter, the company also removed approximately 145,000 subscribers from the regions of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, due to the impact of Hurricane Maria. Further, the company activated approximately 638,000 gross new pay-TV subscribers, compared with around 736,000 subscribers in the prior-year quarter.DISH Network lost 50,000 broadband subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 20,000 in the year-ago quarter.The trajectory of subscriber losses in pay-TV signifies an unprecedented annual decline.All the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Optimistic Pay-TV IndustryDespite the dismal picture, pay-TV operators currently enjoy certain positives. The cable MSOs in the United States have successfully maintained their lead over telecom operators in the high-speed broadband (Internet) market. Moreover, to stay ahead in the competition, cable companies are introducing latest technologies like DOCSIS 3.1 technology. DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections.Meanwhile, several research firms have estimated that major pay-TV operators offering traditionally managed TV services and next-generation online services will hold nearly 80% of the market share till 2022. In June 2017, research firm Strategy Analytics estimated that annual spending on subscription video and TV services in the country will reach $130.3 billion in 2019.Bottom LineThe presence of online video streaming providers is posing significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represents the core business function of cable-TV operators, is losing popularity. At this point, pay-TV operators are planning to revamp their business model to keep their market share intact.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

931,CHTR,"Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) reportedly filed a patent infringement complaint against Mediacom Communications Corp. in the federal court in Delaware. Mediacom is a New York-based cable television and communications provider.Per sources, the national wireless carrier accused Mediacom's digital phone and business phone services of violating Sprint’s 13 patents related to voice-over-packet (VOP) technology. A VOP application allows both voice and signaling information to be transported over the packet network, instead of having a dedicated circuit for each call. However, it has to face challenges of combining legacy voice networks and packet networks.Per this lawsuit, Sprint is seeking damage recovery payment from Mediacom for each infringement. However, the exact amount has not yet been revealed. Moreover, Sprint is demanding an order to ban the sale of Mediacom's products.Notably, many companies like Mediacom have tried to benefit from Sprint’s VOP technology without prior consent. So, Sprint has resorted to legal measures to enforce the patent in the wireless industry.Several cases in the past related to VOP patents have been in the company's favor. In 2007, Sprint received $69.5 million from Vonage America Inc. on grounds of patent infringement. Between 2007 and 2009, Sprint filed complaints in the federal court in Kansas against four companies for infringing six VOP patents. The companies were NuVox Communications Inc., Broadvox Holdings LLC, Big River Telephone Co. and Paetec Communications Inc.In October 2017, Sprint and Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) settled a longstanding dispute over patents. The settlement amount remains undisclosed.In March 2017, Sprint received $139.8 million as damage recovery payment from Time Warner Cable for breaking norms for digital voice telephone services. In 2011, Sprint filed a lawsuit against Time Warner Cable and other cable television companies for breaking patents and using Sprint’s connections and services illegally, without permission. Charter Communications Inc’s (CHTR  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Time Warner Cable, was found guilty of intentionally violating the patents. The jury found that Time Warner Cable broke five patents for Voice-over-Internet Protocol.Notably, Sprint has reportedly received a total of $350 million from settlements related to several patent infringement lawsuits.Similar Patent Infringement CasesThe $1-billion lawsuit between Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) is taking a bitter turn, day by day. With multiple counterattacks from each side, the case has currently taken the turn of patent infringement.

933,CHTR,"Ever since President Donald Trump elected Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the chairman of the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in January 2017, the fate of Net Neutrality has been at stake. Pai, a staunch Net Neutrality opponent, has always maintained his view that consumers would be worse under Net Neutrality and should expect their bills to go up along with slow broadband speed.In May 2017, the FCC voted 2-1 to start the formal process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules. On Nov 21, Pai revealed a draft plan for a complete roll back of Net Neutrality. The FCC is set to vote on the proposed changes at its next monthly meeting on Dec 14.Net Neutrality implies an open-Internet atmosphere. The 2015 Net Neutrality laws reclassified Internet as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act. This gives the FCC increased control over the ISPs (Internet Service Providers). Net Neutrality will prohibit ISPs from discriminating against applications. Earlier, these companies were allowed to restrict any device, application, service, or content from running on their respective networks. (Read: FCC's Net Neutrality Rules: Who Benefits the Most?)Arguments Against Net NeutralityEven when the former FCC under the chairmanship of Tom Wheeler had adopted Net Neutrality, Republican senators were not in favor of this directive. These groups believe that a slight law reformation under section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act would be enough to enforce Net Neutrality.All ISPs, along with several cable TV and telecommunications industry bodies have been vehemently opposing Net Neutrality. The major argument against the directive is that ISPs have to spend several billion dollars to install and upgrade high-speed mobile/fixed- mobile broadband network.Further, disallowing discriminatory pricing policy will significantly reduce revenues and margins, which will result in lower investments in the high-speed broadband sector. Consequently, broadband equipment service providers might suffer (due to lesser investment by ISPs) and loss of jobs is also a likely scenario.Per a recent study by telecom industry body USTelecom, investment in broadband infrastructure declined from its peak at $78.4 billion in 2014 to $77.9 billion in 2015 and $76 billion in 2016. According to USTelecom, the reclassification of broadband as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act has resulted in precipitous lower investment in broadband infrastructure.The Draft Proposals of Ajit PaiPer the new proposals drafted by the FCC chairman, the regulator’s sole concern will be transparency of ISP practices. This will ensure that consumers can buy service plans best suited to them. Also both large and SMB (small and medium business) enterprises can avail instant technical information for product innovation. The draft proposes the return of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in charge overseeing ISP practices for the protection of consumers’ online privacy.Pai strongly argued that a light-touch regulatory measure generated higher investment in the overall telecom industry. For example, establishment of Internet fast lanes become necessary for some critical scenarios. Remote healthcare applications and self-driving cars will require high-speed secured broadband connections with exceptional reliability. In these situations, FCC’s soft regulatory policies will enable ISPs to better serve the country.Pai further stated that in the last 20 years, private sector has invested a mammoth $1.5 trillion to install communications network throughout the country. This enormous expenditure happened primarily due to not-so-stringent rules implemented by the regulator.According to Pai, “Internet is inherently an interstate service”. Therefore, the new proposals will prevent state and local governments from creating their own Net Neutrality rules. The current FCC's less restrictive regulatory attitude may also pave the way for new mergers and acquisition deals between ISPs and online digital media companies.Who Will Benefit if FCC Revokes Net Neutrality?Trump himself is a strong critic of Net Neutrality. There is little doubt that if the new FCC scraps Net Neutrality laws, the ISP industry will be the major beneficiary. Leading ISPs including AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) strongly criticised Net Neutrality rules. Each of the above-mentioned stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineTelecommunications is a necessary utility. The need for telecom in both rural and urban areas as well as its role in the infrastructural development of an economy is of vital importance. Net Neutrality may discourage large investments in the telecom sector but will cut down the cost of online access for end-users since content providers will no longer need to pay extra fees. However, it is to be seen how the government manages a trade-off between the two.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

935,CHTR,"Is this the end of Net Neutrality, the most important telecommunications reform undertaken during the Obama regime? Yesterday, Ajit Pai, the Commissioner of Federal Communications Commission (FCC), revealed a draft plan for a complete roll back of Net Neutrality. The FCC is set to vote on the proposed changes at its next monthly meeting on Dec 14.Ever since President Donald Trump elected existing Republican commissioner Ajit Pai as the chairman of the FCC in January 2017, the fate of Net Neutrality has been at stake. Pai, a staunch Net Neutrality opponent, has always maintained his view that consumers would be worse under Net Neutrality and should expect their bills to go up along with slow broadband speed. Notably, in May 2017, the FCC voted 2-1 to start the formal process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules.What is Net Neutrality?Net neutrality implies an open-Internet atmosphere, which will prohibit ISPs (Internet Service Providers), especially the telecom and cable TV operators, from discriminating against applications. In order to control the flow of bandwidth-consuming applications such as video streaming, the ISPs have been discriminating against several web-based contents and applications. Content developers have to pay heavy sums to ISPs for accelerated data transfer.In a historic decision, the FCC had approved Net Neutrality rules, on Feb 26, 2015, after a majority vote. The five-member regulatory body voted in favor of Net Neutrality with a 3-2 margin. However, the voting pattern was clearly divided along party lines, as three Democrat representatives voted in favor of Net Neutrality while the Republican representatives opposed it.The new laws reclassified high-speed broadband (Internet) as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act. Importantly, these regulations were applicable to both mobile and fixed broadband networks. The reclassification of the Internet called for a radical change in the way the government treats high-speed broadband service. This gives the FCC increased control over the ISPs.The implementation of the new law banned common ISP practices such as data traffic blocking, slowing any data traffic and paid prioritization. Notably, paid prioritization is a method through which content developers strike deals with ISPs for fast and smooth transmission of their data traffic. Net Neutrality rules also allow the FCC to supervise interconnection deals, in which content developers pay ISPs to connect with their networks.Arguments Against Net NeutralityAll ISPs, along with several cable TV and telecommunications industry bodies have been vehemently opposing Net Neutrality. The major argument against the directive is that ISPs have to spend several billion dollars to install and upgrade high-speed mobile/fixed- mobile broadband network.

939,CHTR,"The third-quarter 2017 earnings seasons is picking pace with 87 S&P 500 members having reported results as of Oct 20, accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization (based on the latest Earnings Preview). Total earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the same period last year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating EPS estimates and 70.1% surpassing revenue estimates.More than 700 companies are scheduled to release results this week, including 180 S&P 500 members. We can conclude that the third-quarter earnings season is off to a good start.In such a scenario, let’s take a look at the media industry wherein four major media companies — Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report), Shaw Communications Inc (SJR  -  Free Report) and Time Warner Inc  — are set to release third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Oct 26, before the market opens.What Will Q3 Unfold for Media Industry?As per the Zacks Industry classification, the Media Industry is grouped under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).The trend in the media industry has been improving over the past year, in terms of fiscal performance. From third-quarter 2016 till the beginning of second-quarter 2017, the media industry has been faring well. Second-quarter 2017 was disappointing and the quarter under review is projecting declining trends. The downward movement can be attributed to increasing competition from online video streaming service providers and declining advertising revenues.  Cord cutting has become a major threat to the entire media industry, apart from intense competition and a saturated multi-channel video market in the United States. Companies are losing video subscribers to online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. As per a FierceCable report, traditional pay-TV services, including cable and satellite, lost 976,000 customers in second-quarter 2017 due to cord cutting. Comcast lost 34,000 video customers and 22,000 voice customers, while Charter Communications lost 90,000 video customers. DISH Network lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers in the said quarter. The trajectory of subscriber losses signifies an unprecedented annual decline.Revenues from advertisement are a major source of income for media companies. Advertising depends on the health of the economy. It has been witnessed that demand for advertising drops during recession. In second-quarter 2017, Advertising revenues of Comcast declined 2.1% year over year to $574 million, while that of Charter Communications declined 5.8% year over year to $381 million.Accordingly, the highly diversified Consumer Discretionary sector displays a gloomy picture with declining earnings projection for Q3 to the tune of 1.7% year over year as against 4.7% growth in 2Q17. The estimated growth in revenues is pegged at 2.9% compared with growth of 8.8% in the second quarter of 2017.Notably, the third quarter of any year is known for weak seasonality in the media industry.With such mixed prospects and strategic business ideas, the media industry has returned 9.8% outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 20.8%, over the past year.  Media Stocks to Release Q3 Earnings on Oct 26Our quantitative model offers some insight into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to deliver earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Investors interested in media stocks can watch out for the four companies that are scheduled to report their third-quarter 2017 numbers on Oct 26, before the market opens.Comcast, headquartered in Pennsylvania, is one of the leading cable multi-service operators (MSO) in the United States.The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.95% because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 50 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents. A favorable Earnings ESP indicates a positive earnings surprise.Further, in the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.33%. Moreover, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 7.77%.Moreover, Comcast currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP.

940,CHTR,"DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Nov 9, before the opening bell.The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters and missed the same in the remaining two quarters, with an average beat of 0.76%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why Do We Expect a Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that DISH Networkis likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of the two key elements.Zacks ESP: DISH Networkhas an Earnings ESP of +1.68%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 61 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 60 cents. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DISH Network currentlyhas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of the company’s favorableZacks Rank and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.DISH Network Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  DISH Network Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | DISH Network Corporation QuoteWhat is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?DISH Network has created an extensive portfolio of wireless spectrum worth $50 billion. We are impressed with the company’s efforts to diversify its business model from a pure-play satellite-TV operator to an Internet-TV operator. This should aid the company to counter competitive threats from low-cost video streaming operators. The launch of Air TV Player bodes well for DISH Network’s prospects.Moreover, DISH Network has been trying to lure customers for its Internet-TV service, Sling TV, by offering services at a reasonable rate along with the addition of other premium networks such as Showtime. Despite such efforts, the company has failed to gain subscribers in the broadband and pay-TV segment.In second-quarter 2017, DISH Network lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company lost 46,000 broadband subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 15,000 in the prior-year quarter. This trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline. DISH Network continues to struggle with the persistent loss of subscribers due to cord cutting. Notably, online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming.DISH Network witnesses intense competition in the pay-tv market from players like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report). The company received a penalty of $280 million in a telemarketing lawsuit, which is a woe. Also, escalating programming and content expenses and retransmission fees may impede the company’s margins. In second-quarter 2017, DISH Network’s performance in certain metrics was disappointing. We hope that the company will recover from the downturns in the to-be-reported quarter.Due to such headwinds, the company’s shares have lost 20.0% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.7%.A Closer View of Subscriber StatisticsIn third-quarter 2017, DISH Network expects to lose 127,000 pay-TV subscribers compared with a loss of 196,000 subscribers reported in the year-ago period. As of Sep 30, 2017, DISH Network’s pay-TV subscriber base totaled 13.209 million, down from 13.332 million in the previous quarter.Moreover, DISH Network anticipates a loss of 38,950 broadband subscribers in the to-be-reported quarter compared with a loss of 46,000 broadband subscribers in the previous quarter. As of Sep 30, the company’s broadband subscriber base is projected at 470,000, down from 509,000 broadband subscribers in second-quarter 2017. Pay-TV average subscriber acquisition cost is pegged at $606 compared with $690 in second-quarter 2017.Key PickHere is a company from the broader Consumer Discretionary sector — which houses DISH Network— that has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Sirius XM Holdings Inc (SIRI  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 2.

941,CHTR,"Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report), the second-largest cable MSO in the United States, is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 35.80%. Moreover, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 23.47%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWe are concerned about Charter Communications’ operations in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Like other cable operators, the company continues to lose subscribers to online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. Notably, in the second quarter of 2017, the company lost 90,000 video customers in the residential segment.Further, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages. Meanwhile, we opine that high-debt levels are a potential hazard. Moreover, the U.S. pay-TV industry remains affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable-TV operators to strengthen their base.We hope that the cable company’s recent carriage disputes with different channels will not severely affect the company’s to-be-reported quarterly earnings results.Due to such headwinds, the company’s shares have declined 0.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.1% over the past three months. When compared with the market at large, the stock’s performance fails to impress as compared with the S&P 500 index's rally of 3.6%. On the flip side, we are bullish about Charter Communications’ efforts to venture into the U.S. wireless industry with plans to launch its wireless services in 2018. Notably, the company has an agreement with national telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) to operate as an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) using the latter’s wireless network. The company will utilize Verizon’s wireless network together along with its WiFi network to offer mobile services.Moreover, the twin buyout of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks have strengthened the company’s foothold in hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and fiber networks. The company is also adopting various initiatives to improve its Spectrum products and cloud-based user interfaces. Also, accelerated residential and commercial customer growth, investments in business services division and rollout of several initiatives should aid the upcoming results.A Closer View of Certain Important MetricsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate projects how the Commercial segment of Charter Communications will perform in the to-be-reported quarter. Estimates show that the company will gain 331,000 high-speed Internet and 8.46 million video subscribers, losing 51,000 video subscribers.The Residential segment holds promise for the company in the to-be reported quarter, with revenues estimated at $8,368 million, which is higher than the previous quarters.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Charter Communications is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Charter Communications has an Earnings ESP of +5.37%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.09, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.04. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Charter Communications has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

942,CHTR,"Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) recently announced that the company will foray into the wireless market in 2018. Notably, the company has an agreement with U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) to operate as an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) using the latter’s wireless network. The company will utilize Verizon’s wireless network together with its WiFi network to offer mobile services.In February 2017, Charter Communications announced that it will be launching experimental field trials of the upcoming 5G wireless network. These trials come on the back of spectrum test licenses granted to the company by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The company is actively testing licensed small-cell technologies and has petitioned the FCC to release 3.5 GHz spectrum, popularly known as the CBRS band, for both licensed and unlicensed use.Charter Communications has decided to combine 4G LTE and upcoming 5G technologies with its existing high-speed broadband network to profoundly enhance connectivity for subscribers. With the acquisitions of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks last year, the company has become the second largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in the United States.On May 8, 2017, Charter Communications and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report), the largest cable MSO in the United States, agreed to jointly work on their wireless services businesses. They aim to better explore their opportunities, and accelerate and enhance each other’s ability to participate in the national wireless marketplace. Importantly, Comcast has already entered the wireless market using MVNO agreement with Verizon and its own WiFi network.While unveiling its unlimited data plan for the wireless market, Comcast stated that its plan is not specifically related to making huge profits or gaining significant market share from incumbent carriers. Instead, it will aim at retaining existing X1 pay-TV bundle subscribers by reducing churn rate. We believe the same logic also holds good for Charter Communications since cord-cutting has become an existential threat for traditional pay-TV operators.Verizon is already offering quad-play services using fiber-based FiOS video and FiOS Internet. AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) has also become a major player in the bundled quad-play offerings after its acquisition of DIRECTV, the largest satellite TV operator.The industry is wondering whether Charter Communications can survive providing just the triple-play video, voice and high-speed data services. We believe it will be tough for the cable MSO to remain competitive without entering the wireless market.Price Performance of Charter CommunicationsCharter Communications’ shares have increased 0.46%, outperforming the industry’s loss of 5.08% over the past 90 days. The company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). However, Verizon, AT&T and Comcast currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

943,CHTR,"Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has dropped Univision Inc.’s Spanish language TV channels from its fiber-based FiOS TV network. Notably, FiOS TV has approximately 4.7 million subscribers. In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Univision complained that the U.S. telecom behemoth pulled down its TV channels at 4:59 p.m. on Oct 16, two minutes before Univision's carriage deal with Verizon was set to expire, without any prior notice to the company.Univision has urged the regulator to assure Verizon to come to the negotiation table to reach a fresh new deal. Univision is the largest Spanish-language TV broadcaster in the United States and is partially controlled by the Mexican cable MSO (multi service operator) Grupo Televisa SA (TV  -  Free Report).On the other hand, Verizon has claimed that Univision has proposed an increase of more than double of what they charge as retransmission fees for access to their channels. This is an excessive price increase by any means. The company also believes that the appeal for Univision’s programming is waning given their reported declining viewership.Conflict between TV broadcasters and pay-TV operators is not new in the United States. At present, Viacom Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) are still holding discussion to reach a negotiation. Earlier this month, The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report) and Altice USA Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report) jointly signed a new retransmission deal after a bitter fight.In the last three-four years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable-TV operators to low-cost OTT (over-the-top) service providers. Online streaming service providers have become a severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming. The trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline as cord-cutting intensifies.Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable-TV operators, is losing popularity. At this juncture, pay-TV operators must revamp their business model otherwise they may gradually lose market share. Consequently, the TV broadcasters are also bearing the brunt of it.Price Performance of VerizonVerizon’s shares have increased 11.62%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.49% over the past 90 days.

944,CHTR,"The third-quarter 2017 earnings seasons is picking up with a few companies having already started reporting their financial numbers. In such a scenario, we have witnessed disappointing share price performance and declining subscriber count reports from some of the major U.S. pay-TV stocks – AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report).Consequently, other stocks like Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report) and DISH Network Corp (DISH  -  Free Report) have also reported a fall in their share price.All the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.On Oct 12, 2017 shares of AT&T declined 6.10% to $35.86, while Verizon’s shares decreased 1.04% to $48.35. Cable companies like Comcast’s shares declined 3.93% to $35.95, share price of Charter moved down 2.58% to $355.71, whereas DISH Network shares plunged 5.07% to $49.03.AT&T and Comcast have already unveiled their subscriber losses. Let’s take a closer look into their recent updates on their financial numbers: -AT&T: In its latest filling with the Securities and Exchange Commission, AT&T has reported a loss of 390,000 subscriber in its traditional pay-TV video service, inclusive of 90,000 net video subscribers’ loss, in third-quarter 2017 results.AT&T blames recent natural calamities such as the multiple hurricanes that hit the U.S. coasts and a devastating earthquake in Mexico for declining subscriber count. Intense competition in traditional pay-TV markets have also affected the count. Subscriber reduction is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as the company is yet to fully restore its operations which were negatively impacted by natural calamities.On a positive note, the company added 300,000 internet video subscribers on its Over-the-top (OTT) DirecTV Now service. Notably, the company will release third-quarter results on Oct 24, after the closing bell.Management stated that the company’s consolidated revenues in the third quarter will be affected by $90 million ($210-million pre-tax). Consequently, earnings per share (EPS) will decline 2 cents. Nevertheless, AT&T has reconfirmed its 2017 financial outlook. In January, management projected that its consolidated revenues will grow in low-single digit in 2017. Adjusted EPS growth will be in the mid-single digit range. Adjusted operating margin will expand in 2017. Full-year capital expenditures and free cash flow will be approximately $22 billion and $18 billion, respectively.Comcast: Comcast is also expected to lose around 100,000-150,000 video subscriber in the third quarter. Comcast is among the few top pay-TV operators with the capaability to expand video base amid an acceleration of cord-cutting in the last 18 months. The operator added 161,000 customers in 2016 and ended the first six months of 2017 adding another 8,000 pay-TV subscribers, despite record industry attrition in the second quarter of 2017Notably, the third quarter of any year is generally known for weak seasonality in the pay-TV segment.Why the Downturn?The major reasons behind the subsequent fall in share price are cord-cutting and increasing competition from online video streaming service providers in the domestic pay-TV industry. Moreover, the industry is currently witnessing massive consolidation.Let’s have a closer look at the current doldrums in the U.S. pay-TV industry.Cord-Cutting: In the last 3-4 years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable-TV operators to large telecom operators and low-cost OTT service providers. The industry has been losing customers to wireless telecom operators and online streaming service providers. Online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming. Moreover, this business model is gaining momentum, even during economic uncertainties.In the second quarter of 2017, Comcast lost34,000 video customers and 22,000 voice customers, while Charter Communications lost 90,000 video customers. DISH Network lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers in the said quarter compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter.The trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline.Saturation: The domestic multi-channel video market has also become extremely saturated, where spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the domestic telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it difficult to manage mobile data traffic, which is growing by leaps and bounds. The situation has become acute with the growing popularity of iPhone and Android smartphones as well as rising online mobile video streaming, cloud computing and video conferencing services.Internet-TV Services’ Failure to Stand against OTT: In order to cope with the loss and remain competitive in the market, pay-TV operators have started offering internet TV services with selected TV channels at cheaper rates.  The Internet TV service, launched by leading pay-TV operators in the United States, has been gaining market traction since 2015. Nevertheless, the pay-TV operators are yet to find out an appropriate trade-off between these two types of services. Making online ventures more attractive is resulting in more subscribers for the new services at the expense of traditional pay-TV business model.Ultimately, cord cutting due to Internet TV is yet to stop, which is currently the biggest threat for pay-TV operators. In terms of customer retention, legacy pay-TV operators are yet to cope with the onslaught of low-cost online video streaming service providers. Hence, how long will they succeed in saving the companies from subscriber loss still remains a question.Telecom Operators & Cable TV Operators - Segment Overlapping: Competition is intense as both basic phone service providers and cable-TV operators are increasingly entering into each other’s territory. While Verizon and AT&T have long been servicing customers with fiber-based video networks, leading cable companies like Comcast and Charter Communications are venturing into wireless arena.Currently, both companies are negotiating with national wireless carrier Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) for a possible MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) deal or an outright purchase of Sprint. Meanwhile, AT&T has strengthened its pay-TV services after the acquisition of largest satellite-TV operator DirecTV.Research Firm Opinions’: Research firm RBC predicted that customer churn in the legacy pay-TV segment could soon accelerate to around 5 million a year. In June 2017, research firm SNL Kagan had predicted that the U.S. pay-TV industry (comprising cable, satellite and IPTV operators) will lose approximately 10.8 million customers by 2021. Total pay-TV subscribers will be around 82.3 million at that time, which will be 20% less than the industry’s historical high level. Last month, Research firm RBC predicted that customer churn in the legacy pay-TV segment could soon accelerate to around 5 million a year.Why Should You Still Hold Onto the Pay-TV Stocks?Despite the dismal picture, pay-TV operators currently enjoy certain positives. The cable multi-service operators (MSOs) in the United States have successfully maintained their lead over telecom operators in the high-speed broadband (Internet) market. Moreover, to stay ahead in the competition, cable companies are introducing latest technologies like DOCSIS 3.1 technology. DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs to provide high-speed broadband connections.Meanwhile, several research firms have estimated that major pay-TV operators who offer both traditionally managed TV services and next-generation online services will hold nearly 80% of the market share till 2022. In June 2017, research firm Strategy Analytics estimated that annual spending on subscription video and TV services in the United States will reach $130.3 billion in 2019.Bottom LineThe presence of online video streaming providers is posing significant threat to the existing pay-TV business model. Video offering, which represented the core business function of cable-TV operators, is losing popularity. At this juncture, pay-TV operators must revamp their business model otherwise they may gradually lose market share.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

945,CHTR,"Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) is the one of the world’s biggest media companies, ranking among peers like The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), Viacom , and now, tech giants like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report).It is still the United States’ largest broadband provider, with over 22 million high-speed Internet customers. Comcast has an impressive market value of almost $180 billion. Founded in 1963 and headquartered in Philadelphia, Comcast has created a media empire over the years due to smart acquisitions and media asset-building. Let’s take a look at what the media and entertainment conglomerate owns and operates.EntertainmentComcast has a big foothold in the entertainment industry, with many of its assets falling in film and television.FilmComcast owns popular film studio Universal Studios. It is considered one of Hollywood’s “Big 6” film studios, along with Warner Bros. Entertainment, The Walt Disney Studios, Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, Fox Filmed Entertainment, and Paramount Motion Pictures Group.The studio has produced classic films like To Kill A Mockingbird, Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds, and Schindler’s List, as well as the recent blockbusters Get Out andThe Fate of the Furious. Its highest-grossing movie to-date is 2015’s Jurassic World.Universal operates smaller film studio divisions including Illumination Entertainment, art house-centered Focus Features, Working Title Films, Universal Animation Studios, Universal Interactive, Universal Pictures International, and Universal Studios Home Entertainment.Comcast’s NBCUniversal division acquired DreamWorks Animation studio for roughly $3.8 billion last year. While DreamWorks is best known for its hit animated franchises Shrek and Kung Fu Panda, much of the studio's value to Comcast is in the so-called “long tail” of amusement park integrations, merchandise, and other synergistic deals.TelevisionIts most prominent media company is NBCUniversal, which owns and operates a slew of television network companies.In its portfolio, NBCUniversal has the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network, which includes NBC Entertainment, NBC News, NBC Sports, and NBC Studios. It also owns the NBCUniversal Television Group (Universal Television, NBCUniversal Television Distribution, and NBC-owned local television stations around the country), as well as NBCUniversal Cable (includes popular channels like Bravo, E!, USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, mun2, Chiller, SyFy, Sleuth, and Universal HD).The company also owns The Weather Channel Companies with private equity firm Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group (BX). This includes the popular Weather Channel, and its interactive components www.weather.com, and mobile and desktop versions.Through NBCUniversal, Comcast dabbles heavily in sports under NBC Sports Group. This consists of the Universal Sports Network, NBCSN, and the Golf Channel stations, in addition to Comcast SportsNet.Other sports-themed ventures include the MLB Network in partnership with Major League Baseball and other providers; SportsNet New York in partnership with the New York Mets and Time Warner ; Comcast Sports Southeast/Charter Sports Southeast in partnership with Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report); and the NHL Network in partnership with the National Hockey League.The company also has a large international presence with Universal Networks International.The division is comprised of the LAPTV (Latin America Pay Television Service), a television company that Comcast co-owns with Viacom-owned Paramount Pictures, MGM Studios, and News Corp (NWSA  -  Free Report)-owned 20th Century Fox.Universal Networks International also owns the Brazil-based Telecine, which is co-owned with Globosat Canais, Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks, MGM, and 20th Century Fox, as well as Universal Channel Latin America, Universal Channel Brazil, SyFy Latin America, and Telemundo, which includes many local Hispanic television networks.CableComcast did not become the country’s biggest cable provider without acquiring valuable companies along the way.In 1985, Comcast, along with American Television and Communications (a Time, Inc. TIME subsidiary), Tele-Communications, Daniels & Associates, and the Century Southwest Communications Corporation, bought Group W Cable, a division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation.In 2001, it bought the largest cable television operator at the time, AT&T Broadband, a division of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), for over $44 billion.Then, in 2005, Comcast announced that it had bought Susquehanna Communications, a South Central Pennsylvania-based cable television and broadband services provider and unit of the former Susquehanna Pfaltzgraff company, for $775 million in cash. This gave the company about 230,000 basic cable customers, 71,000 digital cable customers, and 86,000 high-speed Internet customers.In partnership with Time Warner in 2006, Comcast purchased the majority of the floundering Adelphia Communications Corporation, which was the fifth largest cable company in the U.S. before filing for bankruptcy.Comcast began promoting its Xfinity service in 2010. This includes what they call their “triple play” services: digital cable, cable Internet access, and cable telephone. Today, most of Comcast’s cable services have changed names to reflect the Xfinity brand. For example, Comcast Digital Cable has been renamed ""Xfinity TV,” Comcast Digital Voice became ""Xfinity Voice,” and Comcast High-Speed Internet has been renamed ""Xfinity Internet.”Other Business UnitsIn order to cash in on digital trends, Comcast created a division called Comcast Interactive Media; this unit includes XFINITY.com and xfintityTV.com, popular movie ticket service Fandango, entertainment ticketing company New Era Tickets, online video publishing company thePlatform, and StreamSage.The company also owns and operates sports and entertainment venues under the division Comcast Spectacor. Through this unit, Comcast owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL; it also owns and manages the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.As part of its NBCUniversal division, Comcast owns and operates its theme park subsidiary Universal Parks and Resorts. There are currently four running parks: Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles; Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Florida; Universal Studios Japan in Osaka, and Universal Studios Singapore in Singapore.Comcast partnered with Disney and 21st Century Fox to form Hulu, a video-streaming entity that is a burgeoning competitor to Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime. At this year’s Emmys ceremony, Hulu became the first streaming platform to take home the coveted award for Outstanding Drama Series for its critically-acclaimed show The Handmaid's Tale, in addition to winning in seven other categories.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

946,CHTR,"Cable ONE Inc. (CABO  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, after market close.The company has a negative earnings surprise history. Cable ONE lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 6.93%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe company, based in Phoenix, AZ, is among the top 10 cable companies in the United States. Cable ONE serves more than 800,000 residential and commercial customers in 21 states with high-speed Internet, cable television and telephone service. As of Dec 31, 2016, it served 513,908 data customers, 320,246 video customers and 115,811 voice customers. The company provides consumers with a wide range of products and services, including wireless internet service, high-definition programming and phone service with free, unlimited long-distance calling.Cable ONE made major changes in its channels and their availability to customers. New line-ups were implemented to make news, sports and other channels easily accessible to viewers. We are also impressed with the company’s effort to reward shareholders with a quarterly cash dividend of $1.75 per share, marking an increase of $0.25 in the company’s quarterly cash dividend. The dividend will be paid on Sep 1 to stockholders of record at the closure of business as of Aug 15. The acquisition of cable operator — NewWave Communications — will enable the company to create a leading high-speed data and cable company. Through this buyout, Cable ONE will be able to serve more than 1.2 million primary service units in 21 states. The deal will aid Cable ONE to expand footprint intol non-metropolitan markets and non-urban areas like Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. The company has optimized its strategy and operations for these regions.We are concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Moreover, cable companies continue to face stiff competition from online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. Further, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages.Cable ONE faces immense competition from leading cable multi-service-operators (MSO) like Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report). This is likely to be a major dampener for the company’s earnings.In the past three months, shares of Cable ONE have lost 8.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 10.7%.  Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cable ONE is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Cable ONE has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $4.91. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cable ONE has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Cable One, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Cable One, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cable One, Inc. Quote We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Key PickHere is a company from the broader Consumer Discretionary sector — which houses Cable ONE — that has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.DISH Network Corp (DISH  -  Free Report) is expected to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 9. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.

948,CHTR,"Shares of satellite-TV operator DISH Network Corp (DISH  -  Free Report) have tumbled to a 52-week low of $51.63 during the trading session on Oct 9. However, the figure recovered marginally to close at $51.68, down 3.09%.Over the past 52 weeks, shares of DISH Network have ranged from a low of $51.63 to a high of $66.50. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 1.9 million.Why the Downturn?DISH Network continues to struggle with the persistent loss of subscribers due to cord-cutting. In the last reported second-quarter 2017, DISH Network lost 196,000 pay-TV subscribers compared with a loss of 281,000 in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the company lost 46,000 broadband subscribers in the reported quarter compared with a loss of 15,000 in the year-ago quarter. This trajectory of subscriber losses in pay TV continues to signify an unprecedented annual decline.Over the last 3-4 years, the internal dynamics of the U.S. pay-TV industry have been gradually shifting from cable-TV operators to large telecom operators and low-cost over-the-top service providers. Extensive network of fiber-based video services from telecom operators and the strong presence of online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., have become a severe threat to cable-TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming.Also, DISH Network faces intense competition in the pay-tv market from players like AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report), Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, DISH Network’s top-line growth remains under pressure due to its failure to strike any deal with wireless operators to deploy a nationwide wireless network. The company might be affected after failing to renew long-term programming contracts on favorable pricing and other economic terms. Also, escalating programming and content expenses and retransmission fees may impede the company’s margins.Additionally, penalty of $280 million by the U.S. District Judge of the Central Illinois District, Sue Myerscough, in a telemarketing lawsuit was a major setback. This was possibly the biggest judgment ever related with such a case. We expect DISH Network to quickly resolve all such disputes and focus on growth-based strategies.We believe that stiff pricing competition, stringent regulatory norms along with anti-competitive and unfair business practices charges are reasons behind the decrease in the company’s share pricePrice PerformanceThe price performance of DISH Network fails to impress. Over the past three months, shares of DISH Network have declined 20.2% as against the industry’s gain of 2.2%. Estimates on the DownswingWe note that the sales and earnings per share (EPS) estimates for DISH Network has moved down for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.Sales growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to decelerate 4.1% and 4.6%, respectively. For 2017, sales are expected to drop 4.2%.EPS growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to decelerate 4.8% and 13.9%, respectively. For fiscal 2017, EPS is expected to drop 32.2%.The downward estimate revisions reflect pessimism over the prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Certainly Not a Broker’s FavoriteGiven the challenges faced by the company, the stock is not a favorite pick for brokers right now.Over the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 earnings has gone down 1.6% to 61 cents per share and 4.8% to 60 cents, respectively. Likewise, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has plummeted 69 cents to $2.07 per share.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by broker’s advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. Notably, the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

951,CHTR,"Leading cable TV operator, Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), primarily offers three services – video, high-speed data and voice over its broadband cable systems to both residential and business customers.We are concerned about Charter Communications’ operations in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market. Like other cable operators, the company continues to lose subscribers to online video streaming service providers because of their cheap source of TV programming. Notably, in the second quarter of 2017, the company lost 90,000 video customers in the residential segment.On the other hand, the twin buyouts of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks have strengthened the company’s foothold in hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and fiber networks. The company is also adopting various initiatives to improve its Spectrum products and cloud-based user interfaces. Also, accelerated residential and commercial customer growth, investments in business services division and rollout of several initiatives should aid the upcoming results.Charter Communications currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The company competes with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), DISH Network Corp. (DISH  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) in the intensely competitive pay-TV industry. AT&T and DISH Network have Zacks Rank #4 while Comcast carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has generated negative average earnings surprise of 23.47% in the previous four quarters. We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below:Earnings:  Charter Communications lags earnings estimate in third-quarter 2017. Our consensus EPS (earnings per share) estimate was $1.04 while the company reported EPS was just 19 cents.  Investors should note that these figures take out stock option expenses.Revenue:  Charter Communications generated total revenues of $10,458 million, which fell below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of approximately $10,485 million.Key Stats to Note:   During the third quarter of 2017, residential high-speed Internet subscribers rose by 249,000 to 22.282 million. Voice subscribers grew 27,000 to 10.405 million. However, video subscribers decreased by 104,000 to 16.542 million.Stock Price:  At the time of writing, the stock price of Charter Communications was down nearly 2% in the pre-market trade on Nasdaq. Clearly the initial reaction to the release is negative. The company lost significant numbers of video customers. Both its top and bottom lines have failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimates.  We believe this unimpressive performance is the primary reasons for this initial negative sentiment.    Charter Communications, Inc.

952,CHTR,"Frontier Communications Corporation (FTR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the leading telecommunication company in the United States delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79%. However, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, with an average miss of 22.89%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the past three months, share price of Frontier Communications has declined 27.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.1%.  Moreover, the company continues to suffer from the loss of legacy fixed telephony business to wireless, decline in access lines and wireless backhaul revenues due to customer migration to Ethernet solutions at lower price points. Reports about outages, bad telephone service and problems with billing raises concern.Despite such headwinds, we are impressed with Frontier Communications’ focus on generating profits through customer retention, market share gain, product introductions, broadband expansion and improved sales and marketing initiatives. The company has been trying to derive benefits from the growing Business Service Segment. Frontier Communications’ Vantage TV service rollout in North Carolina is likely to leverage from its acquisition of Verizon Communications’ wireline assets in the state. By foraying into North Carolina, Frontier Communications will challenge major incumbents like AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report).Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively project a beat for Frontier Communications in the quarter under review. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Frontier Communications has an Earnings ESP of -6.14%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.18, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at a loss of $1.11. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Frontier Communications has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Frontier Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Frontier Communications Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Frontier Communications Corporation Quote Stock to ConsiderHere is a company from the broader Utilities sector, which houses Frontier Communications, which has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.TELUS Corporation (TU  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.91% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

954,CHTR,"Shares of U.S. telecom behemoth, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) slipped to a 52-week low of $35.58 during the trading session on Sep 7. However, the figure recovered marginally to close at $35.60, down 2.65% from the closing price on Sep 6.Over the past 52 weeks, shares of AT&T have ranged from a low of $35.58 to a high of $43.03. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 22.01 million.Why the Downturn?We are concerned about AT&T’s operation in a saturated wireless market, where spectrum crunch has become a major issue in the domestic telecom industry. Most of the carriers are finding it difficult to manage mobile data traffic, which is growing by leaps and bounds. The situation has become acute with the growing popularity of smartphones, online mobile video streaming, cloud computing and video conferencing services.Apart from saturation issues, competition is intense in the domestic wireless postpaid and prepaid industry. The gap between prepaid and postpaid average revenue per user (ARPU) has narrowed significantly, forcing telecom biggies to turn their attention to domestic prepaid mobile service business.Stiff pricing competition in the industry is a genuine concern. In this scenario, the entry of non-wireless cable giants, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report), has increased competition.In order to counter competition, AT&T continues to offer several low-priced service plans and attractive promotional discounts, both for individual customers and business entities. Although such offers increase the company’s top line by adding customers, but the costs incurred during marketing campaigns and advertisements is likely to affect the company’s margins. This may further led to a high cash burn rate and heavy losses for these companies.The company’s wireline division continues to struggle with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data, video) offerings by the cable companies. In the last reported second-quarter 2017, total wireline broadband connections were 1.384 million, down 5.2% year over year. IP-broadband was pegged at 992,000.Additionally, stringent regulatory measures and union issues are other major headwinds.All these factors have led to the company’s share price hitting a new 52-week low.Price PerformanceAT&T has not been performing well of late. Over the past six months, shares of AT&T have declined 15.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 8.2%.Moreover, when compared with the market at large, the stock’s performance is pretty dreary, as the S&P 500 index has rallied 4.5% over the same time span. Sales Estimates on a DownswingWe note that the sales estimate for AT&T has moved down for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.Sales growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to decelerate 1.34% and 0.74%, respectively. Additionally, for 2017, sales are expected to drop 1.69%.Earnings Surprise AT&T does not have an impressive track record with respect to earnings surprise. This is because the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate only in the last reported quarter, while keeping in line with the same in the remaining three of the previous four quarters.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAT&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector include Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report), ADTRAN Inc. (ADTN  -  Free Report) and America Movil S.A. B. de C.V.

955,CHTR,"Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report), one of leading media and marketing companies in the United States, is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 26. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.5%. Moreover, in the trailing four quarters, it delivered an average earnings beat of 5.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Influencing this QuarterManagement had earlier stated that Meredith’s earnings in first-quarter fiscal 2018 are likely to be in the range of 60-65 cents a share, down from 75 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Sharp decline in earnings projections for the quarter is primarily due to benefits of 22 cents registered in the year-ago period from robust political advertising revenues. Further, shift from traditional advertising and stiff competition may impact  performance.Nevertheless, strategic endeavors such as increase in digital offerings, the launch of new magazine, The Magnolia Journal, and addition of newscasts across television stations, along with focus on non-advertising revenue generating avenues such as retransmission fees, brand licensing and e-commerce are likely to drive the top line higher.To strengthen its position, Meredith has launched additional newscasts in the Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland, Nashville, Greenville and Flint/Saginaw markets. The company also renewed licensing program with Wal-Mart Stores, which allows it to showcase 3,000 SKUs of Better Homes & Gardens branded products at 5,000 outlets and on Walmart.com.Meredith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Meredith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Meredith Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 64 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of over 15%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $397.1 million compared with $400 million reported in the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Meredith is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Meredith has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 64 cents. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.

956,CHTR,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers, before the opening bell on Oct 26. In the previous quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16.7%.Notably, the company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters by an average of 8.2%. Here’s a discussion of the determinants of the second-quarter results.Factors Influencing This QuarterAfter generating record revenues in 2016, WWE had impressed investors with its revenue generation ability. In the first and second quarters of 2017, the company had reported top-line growth of 9.9% and 10.7%, respectively. We believe WWE will continue to report record revenue growth as it has not only extended its earlier deal but also signed agreement with new service provider for airing its flagship program Raw and SmackDown in different countries. Further, subscriber growth and worldwide increase in TV rights fees will boost the top line further higher.In July, WWE reached an agreement with sports marketing agency Lagardère Sports in an effort to augment revenues. Per the agreement, Lagardère Sports will help in building partnership portfolio through its sponsorship proficiency and global sales channel in all international regions, excluding China. We believe with increasing subscription based video streaming services, WWE Network through its vast presence in over 180 countries will be able to capitalize on the trend. Consequently, this is likely to aid top-line growth.Moreover, management is optimistic about achieving another great year of revenues and adjusted OIBDA growth. The company is targeting adjusted OIBDA of $100 million for 2017, up nearly 25% from the 2016. In first-half 2017, the company has already generated adjusted OIBDA of $36.7 million. For the third quarter, adjusted OBIDA is projected in the range of $31-$35 million driven by top-line growth, WWE Network subscribers and contractual television rights fees. In the fourth quarter, it anticipates adjusted OIBDA of at least $28-$32 million.However, WWE operates in the highly competitive market of entertainment video. Further, decline in home entertainment and pay-per view revenues has been a major concern for the investors. In 2016, home entertainment net revenues came in at $13.1 million in comparison with $13.4 million and $27.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Further, the trend continued in the first and second quarter of 2017, with home entertainment revenues declining 27% and 3.2%, respectively. The decline in home entertainment revenues has been primarily due to steady shift of consumers to digital formats, downloaded or streamed over the Internet.World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether World Wrestling Entertainment will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 20 cents, in comparison with year-ago quarter earnings of 14 cent. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $173.2 million compared with $164.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Zacks Model Shows Unlikely BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show that WWE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. WWE has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 20 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP but an ESP of 0.00% makes a surprise prediction difficult.

957,CHTR,"U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Oct 19.Last quarter, Verizon’s bottom line was on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters, with an average miss of 1.10%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayWe remain concerned about Verizon’s operation in the highly competitive and saturated U.S. wireless industry.Spectrum crunch is a major issue in the domestic telecom industry. Moreover, the entry of major cable companies like Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc (CHTR  -  Free Report) has further intensified competition. Comcast has already completed the nationwide rollout of its wireless services, while Charter is planning to launch wireless services in 2018.The company’s wireline division continues to suffer from persistent losses in access lines owing to competitive threats from voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data, video) offerings from cable companies. Verizon ‘s plans to cut costs over the next four years and support the dividend payout with savings by 2022, implies the company’s high debt levels. Funding of dividends is difficult with rising debts.On the flip side, Verizon has restructured its unlimited data plans and has teamed up with Amazon.com, Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report) to deliver virtual network services at a global scale. Verizon, along with Ericsson and Qualcomm have achieved a download speed of 1.07 Gbps. Verizon’s 5G wireless network trials, plans to deploy fixed wireless version in 2018 and the deal to buy Straight Path Communications complements its 5G wireless expansion strategies. Verizon is preparing to launch an online TV streaming service later this year. We expect that these announcements will aid Verizon to gain subscribers in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, we appreciate Verizon’s efforts to reward shareholders with a quarterly dividend of 59 cents per share, an increase of 1.25 cents or 2.2% from the previous quarter. This is the 11th consecutive year, wherein Verizon's board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend increase.Buyout of Yahoo aids Verizon’s digital media suite. Meanwhile, Verizon continues to remain on track to fortify itself in the fiber and Internet of Things space through different deals.Price Performance and A Closer View on Certain Important MetricsOn a positive note, the company portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, shares of Verizon soared 9.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 1.2%.  When compared with the market at large, the stock’s performance looks outstanding, as the S&P 500 index is pegged at 3.6%, over the same time frame.  We believe that the market expects this momentum to continue in the upcoming days, on the back of the overwhelming hike in the price. We also believe that the achievement occurred due to the better performance of certain other important non-financial metrics.Improvement in subscriber addition holds promise for Verizon in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of postpaid wireless subscriber addition for third-quarter is 415 million.The prepaid wireless segment is also expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2017, with net subscriber addition of 41.37 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total wireless operating revenues for third quarter at $21,571 million.Postpaid churn (another crucial metric for the wireless industry) is estimated to be 0.01% by Zacks.Retail postpaid ARPA (average revenue per account) is expected at $136 by Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be reported quarter.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Verizon is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP:Verizon has an earnings ESP of -0.22%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 97 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 98 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Verizon has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Key PicksHere are some companies from the broader Computer and Technology sector , which houses Verizon, and have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.84% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

958,CHTR,"Bethpage-based broadband communications and video services provider, Altice USA Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report) has reportedly reached an agreement with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) in relation to the dispute over channel carriage and retransmission fees.The retransmission contract between the two companies was set to expire on Sep 30. The contract’s deadline has currently been extended in order to finalize the terms.This implies uninterrupted access to Disney’s ESPN, ABC, the Disney Channel and other networks for Altice USA's Optimum cable customers in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.However, no further details of the tentative agreement have been provided by either of the companies.Disney and Altice USA disagreed over the amount the cable operator will pay to continue offering ESPN, ABC and other channels on its Optimum cable service.Disney's most important network, ESPN, has been losing subscribers and witnessing downward ratings, leading to declining revenues. Hence, Disney intended to increase its per-subscriber fees to offset revenue declines. Altice USA claimed that the programming fees were already high.Notably, both the companies are under pressure from cord cutting i.e. loss of pay-TV subscribers to online video streaming providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. This business model is gaining momentum, even during economic uncertainties, and has proven to be a threat to the pay-Tv industry’s business.Due to cord-cutting, traditional pay-TV services, including cable and satellite, lost 976,000 customers in the last reported second-quarter 2017. Major cable TV behemoths like Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) lost 34,000 video customers and 22,000 voice customers. Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) lost 90,000 video customers in second-quarter 2017.Price PerformanceOver the past month, shares of Altice USA have declined 10.5% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.8%.Altice USA currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

959,CHTR,"The U.S. wireless market is currently witnessing cut-throat pricing competition. Almost 68% of the market is controlled by U.S. telecom behemoths Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report). The nation’s third and fourth largest mobile network operators, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report), are also striving to expand their foothold. In this scenario, the entry of non-wireless cable giants like Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) and Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR  -  Free Report) will further intensify competition.  As a counteractive measure against competition, domestic wireless carriers continue to offer several low-priced service plans and attractive promotional discounts, both for individual customers and business entities. Toward this end, carriers have constantly been offering latest versions of iPhone to attract new customers from their rival carriers. iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by tech giant, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report)Wireless carriers like U.S. Cellular Corporation (USM) and T-Mobile US have previously offered iPhone 7 to attract new subscribers.In order to bolster its wireless services, Comcast also inked a partnership with Apple to sell the latest version of iPhone along with its upcoming wireless venture. Comcast’s wireless service will be launched under the Xfinity Mobile brand.Accordingly, all these efforts paid off, as the four wireless carriers witnessed a stark improvement in terms of their subscriber statistics in the last reported second quarter of 2017.All the above-mentioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Postpaid ChurnPostpaid churn is a crucial metric for the wireless industry. It denotes the percentage of subscribers in a given time frame that cease to use the company's services for one reason or another. It is used as an indicator of a company's subscriber base.While Verizon’s quarterly retail postpaid churn rate was 0.94%, flat year over year, T-Mobile US’ branded postpaid churn declined from 1.27% to 1.10%.Post churn of AT&T and Sprint improved year over year. AT&T’s wireless postpaid churn rate was 0.97% compared with 0.91% in the year-ago quarter. Sprint’s total retail postpaid churn rate was 1.65% compared with 1.56% in the year-ago quarter.With such mixed churn rates from the telecom biggies and the costs of marketing campaigns (which is likely to hurt the company’s margins), we wait to see for how long will the customer retention rates sustain. Falling prices and growing consumption undoubtedly put more focus on subscriber acquisition to drive growth.Bottom LineWith the launch of its mega edition iPhone 8, Apple is likely to make a big innovation leap. Following this, the battle between the wireless carriers to outperform each other with different promotional campaigns for iPhone 8, is likely to gain momentum in the second half of the year. Network operators have plans to leverage those new phones with aggressive promotions to boost their market share at a critical time of year. With the increase in smartphone launches, we expect aggressive promotional offers by Sprint and T-Mobile US, which may impede margins in the coming quarters. Least is expected from AT&T, as the telco seems to be more focused on establishing its entertainment services through its over-the-top (OTT) service, DIRECTV.Other vendors including Samsung and Google are also gearing up with the release of new, high-end handsets.Moving forward into the second half of fiscal 2017, we expect to witness continued handset momentum. This should impact trends in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we can anticipate an upgrade and switching activity throughout this period.Customers keenly wait for new flagship phones and the opportunity to switch to the most competitive offers. Operators know that flagship season is the best time to entice customers, as long as the company is willing to compete and absorb increase in subscriber addition and even retention costs. With a month left for third-quarter 2017 results, churn rates will be the most interesting statistic to monitor.We expect costs to rise, margins to shrink and churn rates to escalate.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

960,CHTR,"On Aug 31, we issued an updated research report on Charter Communications Inc.  (CHTR  -  Free Report), the second largest cable MSO (multi service operator) in the United States.Recently, the company launched lucrative promotional offers in order to stay competitive along with a strong subscriber base. In fact, the cable company is offering a double-play package of Spectrum TV (more than 130 channels) and 60 Mbps internet (100 Mbps in some markets) for $29.99 each.The Spectrum TV was launched by Charter Communications, after the twin buyout of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, and is aimed at uniting the viewing experience of these two big MSOs on a single podium. Additionally, Charter Communications has been undertaking various initiatives to make its Spectrum products even better. The company has developed its cloud-based user interface named Spectrum Guide, to run on all set-top boxes offering advanced video navigation. Also, it has initiated the rollout of its Spectrum WiFi, which provides unlimited Internet access to residential customers even when they are outdoors.Notably, such initiatives are primarily focused on to lure more subscribers.Charter Communications currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Going forward, we anticipate the wireless venture of Charter Communications in collaboration with Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report). For this much-hyped wireless venture, both companies have already signed a Mobile Virtual Network Operator agreement with U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) to utilize its wireless network.Consequently, shares of Charter Communications have rallied 23.1% compared with the industry‘s growth of 8.8% over the last six months.We are however, concerned about the company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market.Meanwhile, online video streaming service providers such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc., pose severe threat to cable TV operators because of their extremely cheap source of TV programming, which is in vogue even during volatile economic conditions.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market. Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

961,CHTR,"Charter Communications (CHTR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 2, before the market opens.In three of the previous four quarters, the company’s bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average miss of 53.32%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors Likely to Influence in Q4Charter Communications’ plans to launch wireless services in 2018 are encouraging. The initiative is aimed at retaining customers in this competitive world.Notably, it has inked an agreement with U.S. telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report) to operate as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). The company will utilize Verizon Communication’s wireless network along with its WiFi network to offer mobile services.Further, the company has plans to execute field trials for the upcoming 5G wireless network. Notably, these trials were backed by spectrum test licenses granted by the FCC.The twin buyout of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks has strengthened the company’s foothold in hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and fiber networks. The company is resorting to various initiatives to improve Spectrum products and cloud-based user interfaces.Charter Communications has witnessed growth in residential and commercial internet as well as voice customer addition, evident from increase in revenues and subscriber gain. Further, investments in business services division and rollout of several initiatives will drive upcoming results.Backed by such prospects and latest ventures, the company portrays an impressive price performance. Over the past three months, the stock has returned 16.4% compared with the industry’s rally of 13.3%.  Despite such positives, Charter Communications continues to lose subscribers to online video streaming service providers such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Hulu.com, YouTube etc. because of their cheap source of TV programming. In third-quarter 2017, the company lost 1,04,000 video customers in the residential segment. If the subscriber count continues to fall, Charter Communications’ video businesses are likely to be at risk. The company’s operation in a saturated and competitive multi-channel U.S. video market is a major concern.Further, gaining customers from competitors is a difficult task as most pay-TV operators are offering innovative packages. Moreover, the U.S. pay-TV industry is affected by the ongoing massive consolidation between telecom and cable-TV operators.Charter Communications’ high debt level is a potential hazard. At the end of the third quarter, the company had $2,164 million of cash and cash equivalents and $68,132 million of outstanding debt compared with $1,535 million and $62,464 million, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. The debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of the reported quarter was 0.61 compared with 0.54 at the end of 2016.Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Charter Communications this quarter.
