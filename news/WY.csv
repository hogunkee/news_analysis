5,WY,"A quick look at recently quarterly earnings and sales at Dividend Leader International Paper (IP), and there's not much to get excited about. What is exciting, however, is the stock's recent price action. Since Nov. 8, shares are up around 21%, compared with a 6% gain for the S&P 500. What sets International Paper apart from many other strong price performers…
"
6,WY,"While International Paper (IP) has kept busy this year divesting assets and making acquisitions, it too recently became the target of takeover rumors.Shares rose nearly 2% on Aug. 10 in heavy trade on speculation the paper giant could get acquired by Koch Industries. International Paper has continued higher since and is trading at its highest level in 13 months, rising 9 cents to 48.99 on Tuesday, but retreating 0.5% in morning trade on the stock market today. The stock is well extended past a 44.70 flat-base buy point cleared July 15 in big volume.It's risen 30% this year, beating the S&P 500's 7% year-to-date gain.So far this year, the Memphis, Tenn.-based company has sold its Asian corrugated packaging business and bought a newsprint machine in Spain. And on Aug. 5, the Department of Justice cleared the way for IP to buy the pulp business from Weyerhaeuser (WY)  for $2.2 billion.On July 28, IP reported Q2 results that topped views on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings dipped for a second straight quarter and are expected to follow suit in the back half. Analysts expect annual profit to slip 5% this year before resuming growth in 2017, with a 5% increase to $3.67 a share.IBD'S TAKE: All dividend stocks aren't the same. IBD screens for companies with steady, rising dividends, stable profit growth, and other fundamental and technical criteria. Check out the Dividend Leaders list here.

""As we move into the second half of the year, we remain focused on running our businesses well and closing the Weyerhaeuser acquisition, which will strengthen our position in the growing global fluff pulp markets and create additional value for our shareholders.""International Paper currently pays a quarterly dividend of 44 cents a share, or $1.76 for the full year.

9,WY,"Not everyone learns the rookie mistakes when they’re rookies. That’s especially true when time is tight and your instructor is the real world. Many decades of research have revealed common mistakes investors tend to makes — pitfalls that are traps of human nature. This is the first in a series of Investor’s Corner articles that will map out the most common mistakes among those.Buying a falling stock is one of those pitfalls. It’s tempting, because a pullback after a big advance makes the stock look like a bargain. It’s often most tempting for those who already have a position in a stock and a healthy cushion above their entry point.The issue: When you buy a stock rising from support or at a buy point in strong volume, you are buying the most advantageous point, for it is when institutional investors are piling into it. That momentum leaves you with a cushion, and that cushion helps keep you from being shaken out if the stock makes a normal pullback.When you buy a leading stock rising through a buy point or rebounding from support, you are reducing your risk by taking advantage of IBD research showing these are opportune places at which to buy.Buying on the way down is flying blind, unless you do it on a moderate pullback to the 50-day or 10-week moving average. And then, you need to buy only when the stock bounces in heavy trade.One example is wood products leader Weyerhaeuser (WY). The stock had climbed for the 12 months through the spring of 2013. Its fundamentals were solid, with earnings growth accelerating from double- to triple- to even quadruple-digit growth in the six quarters prior to its peak. Sales growth was in the 20%-to-30% range. The company had also converted to a REIT, providing a juicy dividend.The stock had tested and rebounded from support a half-dozen times in the previous few months. On May 22, it reversed lower from a new high in heavy volume as it started a pullback.That can be a red flag. But the stock had been volatile, and it looked as though it was just reacting to a blip in the general market.Investors who bought anticipating a rebound found themselves with a stock that cut below its 50-day moving average in heavy trade May 29 (1). Combined, the reversal and the drop through the support level were worrisome. Shares fell further in heavy trade and by early June the stock was 8% below a 31.84 buy point.That was a sell signal and no time to be buying at a “bargain” price.Weyerhaeuser corrected a total of 20% in six weeks. Investors who held were forced to take that loss, or sit on their gelded capital while the stock continued consolidating.(Editor's Note: This story originally ran in the Jan. 3, 2014, edition of IBD.)

"
11,WY,"Last year, investors' fears of rising interest rates battered real estate investment trusts, but REIT stocks are on the rise again, as evidenced by market-beating share gains in recent weeks.The Federal Reserve's indication in its policy statement this week that fewer rate hikes were likely this year gave another jolt to REIT shares across the board, from apartment and hotel sectors to industrial properties and shopping malls.Investors tend to shy away from REITs in rising-rate environments because of concern of higher borrowing rates to fund real estate transactions. Since REITs return at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, operators don't have much excess cash on hand for such purposes.But the Fed statement alone is not the only reason REIT stocks are back in favor, real estate experts say. They cite renewed merger and acquisition activity and increased visibility due to the upcoming breakout of real estate into a separate global industry classification. Plus, federal legislation enacted late last year that reduces taxes on the sale of U.S. real estate by foreign investors may also positively impact REIT stocks.""It's a number of factors, which is often the case when markets change direction,"" said Michael Grupe, executive vice president of research at the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.China's Anbang Insurance Group isn't a REIT, but its aggressive moves into U.S. real estate ""provide hard evidence that the changes to the (real estate tax) legislation put in place last year may be having a positive effect on REIT stock prices,"" Grupe said.Anbang just upped its bid for Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT) to $78 per share from $76 per share, or $13.2 billion.IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group hit an intraday high of 324.22 Friday, a number not seen since last April and near a 52-week high. The group was up 2.3% for the week and 7% so far this month.The REIT group has risen by around 9% from a month ago and is roughly 16% higher from a trough hit on Feb. 11.Some of the better performers of late have been Avalonbay Communities (AVB), Simon Property Group (SPG) and Rexford Industrial Realty (REXR). Among the highest rated are CubeSmart (CUBE), CoreSite Realty (COR), Store Capital (STOR) and National Storage (NSA).Stock prices in the broader SNL Financial U.S. equity REIT index, which includes all publicly traded equity REITs in the U.S., are up 3.3% this year. REIT prices in the index fell 1.6% last year.""REIT investors don't like it when interest rates rise,"" said Jason Lail, manager of real estate research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, the parent of SNL. ""The market has a knee-jerk reaction to rising rates. The Fed holding off an interest rate hike had a positive impact.""Investors are also following the money. Fund managers and others have started moving more money into REITs ahead of the creation of a new real estate category under the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, which goes into effect after the market close on Aug. 31.""It's getting closer,"" Grupe said of the deadline. ""It's another positive change (for REITs).""Real estate experts estimate that as much as $100 billion of new investment dollars will flow into real estate securities, mostly REITs, as a result of the new real estate sector, though some estimates are far lower.It will be the first new sector class since GICS was formed in 1999 by Standard & Poor's and MSCI Barra. Real estate is currently sheltered within the broader ""financials"" category.""Investors look at depressed share prices and see a good valuation opportunity (in REITs),"" Grupe said.That may be one reason M&A REIT activity, which went quiet in 2007, is revving up. Since 2015, 13 publicly traded REITs announced deals, with total transaction value of $50.9 billion, Lail said. Blackstone (BX) scooped up three REITs last year, and it is now selling its hotel portfolio to Anbang.Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said in late February it would buy REIT and mall operator Rouse Properties (RSE). A month ago, Weyerhaeuser (WY) acquired Plum Creek Timber.

36,WY,"The mkt paused really - as investors now thought about the latest GDP report - which came in at +1.5%.....(great because it is positive) but when compared to the 2nd qtr it looks a bit pale.....yesterday's report was more a 60% drop from qtr to qtr all at a time when the FED suggests the economy is poised to 'explode' and that 'rates will rise in December'.
"
37,WY,"In addition - yesterday's report was a disappointment when you consider year over year growth......last year's 3rd qtr growth rate was 2% - so all this says is that the economy continues to be held hostage to the dynamics of  weakness at home and abroad.   As the journal points out the ""US Economy Slogs Through Soft Patch"" -  consumer spending, business spending and home building all contributing to our positive report all in the face of 'headwinds' abroad.

40,WY,"When will Washington wake up?  How many more 'inversion trades' must we see before those Bozo's in Congress recognize that they are nothing but a bunch of clowns as evidenced by the new 2 yr budget deal that lifts the debt ceiling even higher and rolls back fiscal austerity...but hey - it removes the risk of a debt limit/default risk for another  2 yrs....so the mkt will embrace that.

42,WY,"US futures are up 2 pts - Global mkts are under a bit of pressure.   The BoJ (Bank of Japan) did not increase their QE program which caught some by surprise but did not cause a negative mkt reaction.   In Europe  - EU eco data was mixed....CPI did rise by 1%, while German retail sales missed the expectation.  Inflation figures were better, but still low and will have no impact on the ECB's plan for more stimulus.

69,WY,"So it was only last week - when we were celebrating the breakout by the Nasdaq market - a breakout that took 15 years to accomplish....On April 24th - My Morning Thoughts started out like this and asked that age old question:
"
70,WY,"Oh.....now it is getting interesting.....but is it getting a bit 'bubbly'?
"
71,WY,"Nasdaq made history yesterday....breaking out of its 15 year purgatory....but the breakout did not come with any fanfare, or bells and whistles.......Yesterday at 11:55 am....traders took the Nasdaq up and thru its former high of 5048 - as it ticked at 5049......... and shift into overdrive....the algo's kicked in forcing it to a new all time intraday high of 5069. At the closing bell - Nasdaq ended the day at 5056....signaling a 'new dawn'....and this during what many would consider the worst earnings season in recent memory (negative 4% growth) ....
"
72,WY,"And that was the 'kiss of death' - Just a few days ago we were celebrating - Nasdaq was the new darling child, the S&P 500 was at an all-time new high and the Dow and Russell were teasing with their all-time highs.........but today - the Dow 30 is now flat for the year and both the S&P and Nasdaq have closed below their 50 day moving average's and the small cap Russell 2000 - well that broke its 50 & is now sitting right on its 100 dma at 1217.
"
73,WY,"In the past week - stocks have reversed course, giving back all of the April gains.....There was not one sector left standing as investors did a little 'window undressing' at the end of the month....or as the incomparable Arthur Cashin of UBS and worldwide fame said:
"
74,WY,"""Today's action looks like end of month window BREAKING""
"
75,WY,"And so it was.....you could hear the smashing glass as investors started throwing everything out the window - the only thing left was the kitchen sink....but hold on - that may be next....
"
76,WY,"We can credit the 'usual suspects'.........ongoing uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates, the pending Greek Tragedy, key weak earnings, weakening macro data and the tensions building in the Persian Gulf as the Iranians try to bully the international community causing us to send warships to 'accompany US ships thru the Strait of Hormuz.....as one 'unidentified' US Official put it:
"
77,WY,"""Out of abundance of caution, because of the unpredictability of our Iranian friends, we're now positioned so that, should the Iranians decide that they're going to be stupid, we're ready to respond...."" (Iranian officials have yet to comment...)
"
78,WY,"So after you turn on the lights and look back- you will see that we haven't gone anywhere in the broad market so far this year. Yesterday, we got confirmation that the economy is not growing...... 4 months ago the GDP was 'supposedly' growing at 5.0% and now the GDP is growing at 0.02%. - Yes - that is NOT a typo.....a 4.98% reversal in activity......and this as all of the major indexes were making all time highs.

79,WY,"But you say - ""Why the negative - we knew this...The Atlanta Fed's forecasting model actually called for growth of 0.01% - so in fact - we beat it! Where are the party hats? What does the Atlanta Fed say about this quarter? Their initial forecast calls for growth of 0.9% - a far cry from the consensus estimates of 3% - so the reality of the robust recovery......well - ain't so robust. These are recession numbers....Hey...I'm just sayin.....
"
80,WY,"Over the last 2 weeks - we have seen the dollar get clobbered (not such a bad thing for the multinationals)...it is down 5% - this though has been good for oil...(dollar down/oil up) and prices ended the month of April up another $1.05 closing at $59.63/barrel or up 17% in that same time. And with tensions building in the gulf - you can rest assured that there is now a floor under the price of oil....(could this whole Iranian thing be a set up to goose oil?)
"
81,WY,"Yesterday we heard from some of the big oil companies.... Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CHV), ConocoPhillips (COP), - while the plunge in oil prices has caused some heartburn for the oil producers it has created a boom for the refiners.....and in fact American refiners are laughing all the way to the bank....because US crude - cheaper than Brent - has given them the competitive advantage over their European and Mid East rivals.......and the plot thickens.....
"
82,WY,"After the bell - LinkedIn (LKND) slashed guidance - blaming the strong dollar and weaker demand for its problems.....the stock was down 5 points during the trading day and then got slammed in the afterhours session......dropping more than 20%....this morning in early pre-market trading it is hovering around $201....There we go again with these 'high growth stocks'......(Recall Twitter) - it is difficult to forecast and guide - so when they do they set themselves up for failure - but anyone trading these names understands that.....and if they don't - they do now.....
"
83,WY,"US futures are up 6 points....not surprising after being down 21 points yesterday.....with the S&P 500 now broken its short term support at 2090 - look for that to become resistance again......support is now at 2070ish......
"
84,WY,"It is May 1st...so expect to hear the 'sell in May and go away' mantra - as historians come out of the woodwork telling us about this phenomenon......This is a well known trading adage - essentially telling investors to take the summer off......
"
85,WY,"Economic data today includes April ISM Manufacturing - expectations of 52. March Construction Spending of +0.5% and University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey...expectations of 96...on the earnings front - look for Weyerhauser (WY), CVS Health (CVS), Legg Mason (LM), VF (VFC) to name just a few.
"
86,WY,"Also, watch for 2 Fed speakers today....Loretta Mester (Cleveland Fed) at 8:30 a.m. ETand John Williams (San Francisco) at 3:20 p.m. - of the two - Williams is the one that has the potential to create more noise.....

107,WY,"When TRI Pointe Homes (TPH) acquired the much larger homebuilding unit of timber titan Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY) this week, it might have seemed like a minnow swallowing a whale. But TRI Pointe chief executive Doug Bauer said his team spent the last eight months laying the groundwork for the merger so that when the $2.8 billion deal closed Monday, ""it…
"
108,WY,"Now that it has leapfrogged up the ranks of homebuilders for a coast-to-coast scope, TRI Pointe Homes wants to become the poster child for a new kind of builder.Call it a hybrid: a cross between a publicly traded builder with a national presence and a small, regional builder with local connections, says CEO Doug Bauer.Monday's $2.8 billion merger with the homebuilding division of timber giant Weyerhaeuser (WY) gave Irvine, Calif.-based TRI Pointe Homes (TPH) five new regional homebuilding brands, with operations stretching to the East Coast.The deal enabled Weyerhaeuser, a real estate investment trust (REIT), to focus on its core timberland and wood-product business.Bauer says that the acquisition positions the company for the housing recovery in some of the nation's most attractive housing markets — in areas such as Southern California, Texas hot spots Houston and Austin, Arizona and around Washington, D.C. And he expects to build a whole new business template.""The big guys have deep pockets, and the regional guys are a little more nimble,"" he told IBD. ""The new vision for TRI Pointe is what I call the next generation of homebuilder, a family of regional homebuilding companies.""You maximize your income by running a local business at a regional level, but you have the deep pockets, economies of scale and (financial) sophistication of a public company. It's the best of both worlds.""Investors seem skeptical of the deal. TRI Pointe stock fell 1.7% Wednesday. And Thursday, shares fell 3% intraday to around 15.TRI Pointe hasn't traded above its January 2013 IPO price of 17 since late May.Stock Market HopscotchUntil the Reverse Morris Trust merger closed on Monday, TRI Pointe had been one of the smaller publicly traded builders in the U.S.It operated in just two states, California and Colorado, and had 3,000 developable lots, though that was up from virtually nothing in 2009, when Bauer and his partners started the firm from scratch.Now it has more than 30,000 lots, a market capitalization lifted from just over $500 million to $2.6 billion and 900 employees, up from 150.The five new homebuilding companies from Weyerhaeuser include Pardee Homes in Southern California and southern Nevada, Quadrant Homes in Washington state, Maracay Homes in Arizona, Trendmaker Homes in Houston, and Winchester Homes in Richmond, Va.Bauer plans to keep the company names and management teams.""My job is to steer this family of homebuilders to generate results as a pure homebuilder vs. being part of a REIT,"" he said.Under the REIT structure, he says, returns from homebuilding operations often were plowed back into the parent company for general operations. Much of the profits were returned to shareholders.But the deal has a potential downside: more inventory than Bauer wanted.Having learned the pitfalls of being stuck with too much in a downturn when he worked for California builder William Lyon Homes (WLH), Bauer had vowed to keep inventory down to no more than three years' worth.Now inventory is at nine years, due in large part to Pardee Homes in California.""I've adjusted my horizon to five years (inventory),"" Bauer said, adding that he thinks it'll take about three years to achieve.""We're going to focus on project sizes of no more than 500 units so we can build and sell them in 36 to 48 months,"" he said. ""That will allow us to weather the ups and downs of the housing business.""As for further expansion, he puts Texas at the top of the list near-term, using the new Houston homebuilding operation as a springboard.""In the short run, probably the closest market I'd like to focus in on is Austin, to the northwest of Houston,"" Bauer said.He says that the new TRI Pointe is comparable in size to such builders as Standard Pacific Homes (SPF), Ryland Group (RYL) and Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC), which also went public last year. Like TRI Pointe, those builders have struggled in the stock market and have low Relative Strength Ratings from IBD.TRI Pointe will also compete in many of its markets with Lennar (LEN), the No. 1 homebuilder in the country by market cap.

110,WY,"Not everyone learns the rookie mistakes when they're rookies.That's especially true when time is tight and your instructor is the real world. Many decades of research have revealed common mistakes investors tend to makes — pitfalls that are traps of human nature. This is the first in a series of Investor's Corner articles that will map out the most common mistakes among those.Buying a falling stock is one of those pitfalls. It's tempting, because a pullback after a big advance makes the stock look like a bargain.It's often most tempting for those who already have a position in a stock and a healthy cushion above their entry point. Things are going swell. The stock has been a ramrod. I'll just step in here and add to my . . .The issue: When you buy stock rising from support or at a buy point in strong volume, you are buying the most advantageous point, when institutional investors are piling into it. That momentum leaves you with a cushion, and that cushion helps keep you from being shaken out if the stock makes a normal pullback.When you buy a leading stock rising through a buy point or rebounding from support, you are reducing your risk by taking advantage of research showing these are opportune places at which to buy.Buying on the way down is flying blind, unless you do it on a moderate pullback to the 50-day or 10-week moving average. And then, you need to buy only when the stock bounces in heavy trade.One example is wood products leader Weyerhauser (WY). The stock had climbed for the 12 months through late May. Its fundamentals were solid, with earnings growth accelerating from double- to triple- to even quadruple-digit growth in the six quarters prior to its peak. Sales growth was in the 20%-to-30% range. The company had also converted to a REIT, providing a juicy dividend.The stock had tested and rebounded from support a half-dozen times in the previous few months. On May 22, it reversed lower from a new high in heavy volume as it started a pullback.That can be a red flag. But the stock had been volatile, and it looked as though it was just reacting to a blip in the general market.Investors who bought anticipating a rebound found themselves with a stock that cut below its 50-day moving average in heavy trade May 29 (1). Combined, the reversal and the drop through the support level were worrisome. Shares fell further in heavy trade and by early June the stock was 8% below a 31.84 buy point.That was a sell signal and no time to be buying at a ""bargain"" price.Weyerhauser corrected a total of 20% in six weeks. Investors who held were forced to take that loss, or sit on their gelded capital while the stock continued consolidating.

112,WY,"Frederick Weyerhaeuser was 18 when he hit New York's shore.It was 1852, and he was one of a million German immigrants escaping the economic upheaval that followed a crushed bid for democracy in his homeland four years earlier.While some set out to find fame and fortune — think fellow emigre Adolphus Busch — Weyerhaeuser (1834-1914) steadfastly avoided the first to focus on the second.With spectacular results.By the time of his death at age 79, Weyerhaeuser's timber empire spanned millions of acres of American forestland and controlled the transport systems and mills needed to harvest them.Though barely known to the general public, he had amassed a fortune worth $80 billion today, making him the eighth richest American of all time.His company lives on as Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY), with 2013 sales of $8.5 billion and a stock that's rolled 300% the past four years.""His place can never be filled,"" railroad magnate James J. Hill said when Weyerhaeuser died. ""He was one of those national forces that helped build our country.""German RiseBorn in what is now the Rhineland community of Saulheim, Frederick was one of 11 children of Johann Weyerhaeuser, who tilled a farm and vineyard.Johann died when Frederick was 12, and the family soon headed for America, settling in Pennsylvania's Erie County.A first job, at an immigrant-run brewery, ended after two years, with Weyerhaeuser noting, ""A brewer often becomes his own best customer.""A stint as a farmhand followed, then work on the Peoria & Rock Island Railroad in Illinois.Next he joined the Mead, Smith & Marsh sawmill, where he rose to yard manager. By 1857 he had married fellow Saulheim native Sarah Bloedel and been sent to manage the firm's new mill in upstate Coal Valley near the Mississippi River.When the corporate parent ran short of cash in 1860, Weyerhaeuser offered $3,000 — worth $85,000 now — for the Coal Valley operation, bringing in brother-in-law Frederick Denkmann as partner.At the start, Weyerhaeuser-Denkmann timber came exclusively from Wisconsin, where 100 camps felled, trimmed and marked logs to float down the Mississippi and its tributaries to sawmills.Significant delays bogged down Weyerhaeuser, who had to wait while upriver mills sorted and pulled their timber from the float.Weyerhaeuser's solution to improve delivery came in 1870, when he patched together Mississippi River Logging Co. The collective united the downriver mills and diverted their logs into a side channel of the Chippewa River, bypassing many of the northern bottlenecks.Appointed the group's president, Weyerhaeuser took over purchasing. He also trekked the northern woodlands to negotiate timber sales on everything from single homesteads to areas as large as 100,000 acres.Timber shipments to the downriver mills increased steadily, from 12 million feet of logs in 1871 to 133 million in 1874.Problems with the upriver mills escalated in 1880, when a spring flood destroyed bridges, dams and booms and sent tens of thousands of logs rushing south passed their waiting mills. Thousands more washed ashore along the way, with some coming to rest as far as 125 miles from the river channel.Weyerhaeuser saw opportunity in the mayhem. He built goodwill by returning errant timber to its rightful owners.Meanwhile, he came up with an expanded collective, officially Chippewa Logging Co. but called ""the pool,"" that would supply mills up and down the river. This cooperative would shape the U.S. timber industry for the next 35 years.The pool's best year was 1896. The record amount of timber floating down the Mississippi included one raft of logs that was 300 feet wide and 1,500 feet long, covering 10 acres of water.""His success was made early on and throughout his career by working with partners,"" Steven Anderson, CEO of the Forest History Society in Durham, N.C., told IBD. ""His business approach was an interesting mix of vision, measured risk-taking, collaboration and integrity. His partners knew his word was his word.""Weyerhaeuser used his surging profit to buy percentages of other mill operations. He also organized investors to buy timber and build sawing operations in Minnesota, Arkansas and Louisiana.The Weyerhaeuser Syndicate eventually boasted 100 partners, with business interests stretching coast to coast and with the boss owning a share of everything.When not afield, Weyerhaeuser — by now called the Lumber King — put in long days at the office, often working until 10 p.m.He spent rare free evenings with Sarah and their seven children.A near teetotaler, taking ""only rarely a glass of light wine,"" according to one newspaper account, he read little and showed no measurable interest in culture.""The bottom line really was his bottom line,"" said historian Char Miller, who heads the environmental analysis program at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif.PrioritiesWeyerhaeuser called his lifestyle ""caring more for my credit than my clothes.""Although he had moved the business and family to St. Paul, Minn., in 1891, he knew the mighty Great Lakes forests were not inexhaustible. So he considered future supplies. Though impressive stands of old-growth timber stood in the South, Weyerhaeuser favored the Pacific Northwest.Proximity was part of the attraction, price even more so.Congress had stamped enormous grants of land to promote the development of transcontinental railroading, and millions of acres remained unused. Many were owned by a Weyerhaeuser neighbor, Hill, who had built the Great Northern Railway and wrested control of the Northern Pacific.One account suggests the two titans haggled only briefly over the price of a massive tract in Washington, with Weyerhaeuser offering $5 an acre to Hill's demand for $7.They settled in between, with Weyerhaeuser paying a bargain $5.4 million (worth $152 million now) for 900,000 acres.Signed in 1900, the deal included discounted rail freight rates that were ""so low they were unheard of,"" as one historian put it.WestwardNeither businessman was sure how much timber the land held, ""but there is a great lot of it in every conceivable direction,"" Weyerhaeuser noted after a 1901 visit.He then moved company headquarters to Tacoma, Wash., and continued to buy land in the state. He ultimately acquired more than 2 million acres with an estimated 40 billion feet of timber.He also bought interests in forestry-related firms, including what are now Potlatch (PCH) and Boise Cascade (BCC), and launched timber ventures for his sons to run.Weyerhaeuser took a hit in 1905 when President Teddy Roosevelt castigated him as ""that man whose idea of developing the country is to cut every stick of timber off of it and leave it a barren desert.""Yet Weyerhaeuser had begun implementing sustainable forest management a year earlier with the now-common practice of replanting cut-over areas. Later he developed high-yield forests that increased timber production while requiring less acreage.He viewed Washington land in particular as a family trust, an investment that was ""not for us or our children, but for our grandchildren.""His brush with Roosevelt aside, Weyerhaeuser lived the twilight of his life as quietly as always. The Lumber King died at his winter home in Pasadena, Calif., after what was described as a bad cold.A family foundation continues to dispense the Weyerhaeuser fortune to causes involved in sustainability and medical care.""He was one of a generation of ambitious immigrant men who came here to make their fortune and, in the process, helped make the nation,"" Miller said. ""We forget them at our peril.""

113,WY,"A couple of months ago Tri Pointe Homes was a smallish homebuilder with a heavy concentration in California and little fanfare on Wall Street.Today the company is poised to become one of the nation's 10 biggest builders as it prepares to move into a handful of new, high-growth markets from one coast to the other.For that, Tri Pointe (TPH) can thank its proposed buyout of Weyerhaeuser Co.'s (WY) homebuilding division in a $2.7 billion deal announced Nov. 4.The acquisition brings Tri Pointe around 27,000 lots and five brands: Pardee Homes in Southern California and Nevada; Trendmaker Homes in Texas; Maracay Homes in Arizona; Winchester Homes in the Washington, D.C., metro area; and Quadrant Homes in the Puget Sound region of Washington.The deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2014. When it does, Tri Pointe would have a market cap of around $2.5 billion, going by current stock levels. That would move it into the top 10 among U.S. homebuilders. The company's current market cap is about $600 million.Good Supply Of LandOfficials involved in the deal said the Weyerhaeuser unit, known as Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co., or Wreco, will give Tri Pointe nine years' worth of land and lot supply.According to industry reports, that compares favorably with the roughly 7.4 years of average supply for leading U.S. homebuilders like Pulte Group (PHM), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN).Part of Tri Pointe's new supply will be in and around large urban markets such as Las Vegas, Houston, Phoenix and Seattle.A majority of the lots — more than 16,000 — are in California, where available land in top markets is shrinking.On a conference call with analysts, Tri Pointe CEO Doug Bauer said the combined company will give Tri Pointe ""a stronger and deeper California market position, a relatively high average-selling-price product line (and) land positions and brand recognition in the nation's most attractive markets.""Wall Street reacted favorably to the news. Tri Pointe's stock, which touched a low of 13.43 on Oct. 9, has since rallied about 35% and currently trades near 18. The stock went public in late January at an IPO price of $17.Even before the deal was announced, Tri Pointe was seeing sales increase sharply. For the past five quarters, revenue has risen by at least triple-digit percentages from a year ago. The Wreco assets should kick growth into an even higher gear, analysts say.""The acquisition of about 27,000 lots in several of the nation's best housing markets will permit Tri Pointe Homes to continue its robust growth pace,"" Brendan Lynch, analyst at Sidoti & Co., noted in a report.""In addition to bolstering inventory, we think Wreco's land .. . will contribute to gross margin expansion to 23.5% in 2014 and 24% in 2015, vs. our call for 22% in 2013,"" Lynch added.Under the terms, Weyerhaeuser shareholders will get 130 million shares, or 80.5% of the combined company. Tri Pointe will get 19.5%.However, Tri Pointe's management will run the firm. Bauer will remain as CEO and Barry Sternlicht will continue as chairman. Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group owns a large stake in Tri Pointe.The Tri Pointe-Weyerhaeuser deal is part of a recent trend that has seen homebuilders use acquisitions to gain quick entry into new markets.In July, Ryland Group (RYL) made its fourth acquisition in a year when it bought the operations and assets of Cornell Homes, a developer in Philadelphia, western New Jersey and Delaware.In September, Meritage Homes (MTH) announced its acquisition of Phillips Builders, a Nashville-based builder.Weyerhaeuser, a timberland owner that makes wood, container board and paper products, began exploring the idea of selling its homebuilding unit in June.In a statement at the time, Weyerhaeuser CEO Dan Fulton said that ""given the improving fundamentals of the housing market, we believe now is a prudent time to explore strategic alternatives for this business.""The Tri Pointe-Weyerhaeuser deal was structured as a tax-free Reverse Morris Trust, which allowed Tri Pointe to buy a larger firm while Weyerhaeuser shareholders would own the majority of shares.When the deal closes, Tri Pointe will have a chance to expand well beyond its current market, which mainly focuses on houses in California and Colorado that sell for $300,000 to $1.5 million.""We have accelerated our long-term plan to be a leading regional homebuilder in some of the nation's fastest-growing markets,"" Bauer said on the conference call. ""The combination of Wreco's local market knowledge and Tri Pointe's strong and established history of success should result in a powerful and focused homebuilding company.""Prices And Revenue GrowingHe made those comments following Tri Pointe's third-quarter earnings release. The company posted earnings of 15 cents a share, topping estimates for 9 cents. Revenue rose more than 480% year over year to $58.5 million, above views for $44.9 million.The average selling price of homes delivered climbed 57% to $624,000 as Tri Pointe benefited from the opening of three communities in Southern California.New home orders nearly doubled to 135 from 74 a year earlier, while homebuilding gross margins improved to 23% from 11.7% the prior year.Tri Pointe said it will have nine active communities by the end of 2013. It expects to open 20 to 24 new communities in 2014, excluding the Wreco assets.""We project that Tri Pointe will sell all of the remaining homes in a few of the nine communities that are open, resulting in an active community count of 27 at year-end 2014,"" analyst Lynch noted.Analysts expect Tri Pointe to post full-year EPS of 47 cents in 2013 and $1.09 in 2014.

142,WY,"The paperboard and construction products maker Weyerhaeuser (WY) posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter numbers, despite a lumbering housing construction market.

143,WY,"Building products manufacturer, Norbord Inc.’s (OSB  -  Free Report) shares scaled a new 52-week high of $32.44 during its trading session on Jul 13. This improved upon the last 52-week high of $32.37, a day earlier.In the last one year, shares of the company have yielded 50.82% return, outperforming the gain of 9.33% recorded by the Zacks categorized Building Products Wood industry.On Jul 13, Norbord closed its trading session at $32.32 per share, yielding a year-to-date return of roughly 28%. Positive earnings estimate revisions for 2017 as well as solid future prospects indicate the stock’s potential for further price appreciation.Growth DriversWe believe that Norbord is committed toward expanding and modernizing its existing Oriented Strand Board (OSB  -  Free Report) mills and hence, improving its overall operations and profitability going forward. For instance, the company plans to invest roughly $135 million for the development of its Inverness, Scotland OSB mill. Also, it is working on a plan for upgrading its Chambord, Quebec OSB mill. In Jun 2017, the company secured wood allocation for its Chambord mill.In addition, Norbord prefers rewarding its shareholders through healthy dividend payments. In May 2017, the company tripled its quarterly dividend rate to C$0.30 per share. The hike was primarily driven by its healthy cash flow position and fall in net debt-to-capitalization ratio.  Going forward, improving housing market conditions in the U.S. will likely drive Norbord’s results. Per the consensus forecast from U.S. housing economists, housing starts will likely improve 8% year over year to 1.26 million in 2017. Also, the company is seeing strong product demand from prime customers, better pricing and lower supply chain inventories, which is likely to drive its results in second-quarter 2017. Results is slated to be released on Jul 28, before the market opens. We believe that Norbord’s solid prospects have led to the positive revisions in earnings estimates. Over the last 60 days, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate increased 16% to $3.26 for 2017. Also, the company has an Earnings ESP of +13.50% for 2017.

144,WY,"Housing starts made a comeback in May 2018, after falling 3.7% in April, reaching the highest level since 2007. However, housing permits fell further in May, following a decline of 1.8% in April.Per the latest jointly-released report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, housing starts increased 5% to 1.35 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in May from the previous month. The figure also improved 20.3% on a year-over-year basis.What Led to the Surge in Starts?Single-family and multi-family starts surged in May. Single-family homes starts, which are of higher importance, rose 3.9% from the prior month and improved 18.3% year over year. Multi-family starts increased 11.3% from the prior month and rose 27.4% from the prior year.Specifically, a 62.2% rise in new residential construction activity in Midwest boosted overall housing starts. However, construction slumped in the Northeast, South and West regions.What Does the Drop in Permits Signify?Residential building permits, an indicator of upcoming construction activity, dropped 4.6% in May to an annualized rate of 1.3 million units from April. Single-family home permits dipped 2.2% and the same for construction of multi-family homes declined 8.5%.  This signifies that construction activity can mellow down in the upcoming months to some extent.Nevertheless, on a year-over-year basis, permits rose 8% with single-family homes increasing 7.7% and multi-family homes increasing 9.1%.  Housing Industry’s Current PositionRecently, a rise in interest rate last week dented investors’ optimism in the housing space. The rise in interest rates came at a time when home prices are increasing, thanks to supply constraints and increased raw materials costs. Builders are unnerved by higher aluminum and steel costs due to the newly-imposed tariffs. This along with increased lumber prices from an import tariff is denting builders’ margins, compelling them to hike prices. Further, troubles like labor shortage, limited land availability and apprehension of two more hikes in 2018 along with three in 2019 continue to make things difficult.Evidently, homebuilder sentiment slid in June from the previous month, to the lowest level this year and below its six-month average of 70. According to Associated Builders and Contractors, construction material prices increased 2.2% in May from the prior month, representing the largest monthly increase since May 2008. On a year-over-year basis, the price of construction materials rose 8.8%.Should You Buy Housing Stocks Now?Though myriad problems have been denting the homebuilding industry of late, evident from the 18.8% year-to-date decline against a 3.5% rise of the broader index, the larger picture is convincingly strong.Consumer demand is robust considering the solid economic scenario, backed by low unemployment and solid wage growth. The solid economic growth is expected to continue with Federal Reserve expecting economic growth of 2.8% for 2018, highlighting an increase of 0.1 percentage point from the estimates issued in March 2018. Fed also expects the rate of unemployment rate at 3.6% in 2018, down from the previous expectation of 3.8%.Top Choices from Top IndustriesAs the solid momentum is expected to continue in the rest of 2018, investors can bet on these stocks from the broader construction sector.

145,WY,"Universal Forest Products, Inc. (UFPI  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that one of its subsidiaries has successfully completed the acquisition of majority assets of Marietta, GA-based North American Container Corporation. Financial consideration of the buyout, originally announced on Mar 27, has not been disclosed.Concurrently, the company announced that it now holds the 610th position on the Fortune 1000 list for 2018. Details of BuyoutNorth American Container Corporation specializes in making structural packaging products — including wood/corrugated, laminated bulk boxes, wood replacement, recyclable and reusable packaging products. Its nine production facilities in Wisconsin, South Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia enable it to meet customers’ demand effectively. Founded in 1967, North American Container’s revenues in 2017 totaled $71 million.As noted, the addition of North American Container’s assets will strengthen Universal Forest’s product portfolio and customer base by bringing corrugated, steel and hardwood packaging solutions under one roof. Also, the buyout will enable the company to leverage benefits by penetrating into growth markets as well as enhancing its technological expertise.North American Container will be integrated with Universal Forest’s Industrial segment. In 2017, the company generated roughly 33.3% of its gross sales (summation of segmental sales) from this segment. On a year-over-year basis, the segment’s sales grew 35% in 2017.Snapshot of Universal Forest’s Inorganic InitiativesWe believe that the above-mentioned transaction is consistent with Universal Forest’s policy of acquiring meaningful businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines.Prior to this buyout, the company acquired Spinner Wood Products and Great Northern Lumber in January 2018. Also, it added Expert Packaging and Fontana Wood Products to its portfolio in April 2018. These buyouts are anticipated to collectively generate revenues of $50 million annually.Universal Forest also believes in disposing of non-core assets. In January 2018, it sold its Medley, FL-based property to improve its operational efficiency and optimize the use of its resources.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksWith a market capitalization of nearly $2.3 billion, Universal Forest currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.57 per share for 2018 and $2.94 per share for 2019, reflecting growth of 9.4% and 7.3% from the respective 60-day-ago tallies. Also, estimates for 2018 and 2019 reflect year-over-year growth of 39.7% and 14.4%, respectively.Universal Forest Products, Inc. Price and Consensus  Universal Forest Products, Inc.

146,WY,"We issued an updated research report on Weyerhaeuser Company (WY  -  Free Report) on Jun 4.With approximately $28.5-billion market capitalization, this building products company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s earnings are projected to grow 5% in the next three to five years.Let’s delve deeper and discuss why investors should consider adding Weyerhaeuser’s stock to their portfolio.Financial & Share Price Performances, Earnings Estimate Revision: Of the last four quarters, Weyerhaeuser delivered better-than-expected results in three while lagging estimates in one. Average earnings surprise was a positive 2.76%. Notably, in the first quarter of 2018, the company pulled off an earnings and sales surprise of 9.1% and 4.2%, respectively. Also, its earnings surged 63.6% on a year-over-year basis.Solid financial results have been one of the reasons for the company’s stock-price rally of 10.8% in the last three months. Though it marginally outpaced 10.3% increase recorded by the industry, this return comfortably surpassed 0.8% growth recorded by the Zacks Construction sector.Also, in the last 60 days, the company’s earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have been increased by three and two brokerage firms, respectively. The stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.46 for 2018 and $1.49 for 2019, representing growth of 7.4% and 8% from their respective tallies, 60 days ago.Favorable Operating Conditions: We believe that strengthening U.S. economy and healthy growth prospects of the global market will create favorable operating conditions for companies that are operating in the building products industry. Considering the housing market of the United States, increase in housing starts, as well as higher demand for repair and remodeling activities, will spur demand for building products.Notably, Weyerhaeuser anticipates housing starts for a single family to increased 10% to approximately 1.3 million in 2018. It’s worth mentioning here that the company predicts earnings in the Wood Products segment to grow higher sequentially in the second quarter of 2018. Also, earnings in the Timberlands segment are anticipated to improve substantially on a year-over-year basis.Strategic Decisions to Drive Profitability: Over time, Weyerhaeuser has undertaken a number of strategic decisions that have helped in augmenting its market reach, strengthened its product portfolio and augmented its profitability.The company undertook several acquisitions between 2013 and 2017. It acquired Longview Timber in July 2013 while divesting WRECO in May 2014, Cellulose Fibers pulp mills in December 2016, timberlands and manufacturing operations in Uruguay in September 2017, and its 21% equity interest in Twin Creeks Timber in October 2017. In addition to these, merger with Plum Creek Timber in February 2016 enabled Weyerhaeuser to benefit from strengthening housing-market conditions in the United States as well as offer better products and services to its customers.Moreover, the company’s initiatives aimed at operational excellence yielded benefits of $172 million for the Timberlands and $327 million for the Wood Products segments between 2014 and 2017. These initiatives are anticipated to yield a benefit of $40-$50 million for the Timberlands segment and $40-$60 million for the Wood Products segment in 2018.Dividend Payments: Weyerhaeuser is an ardent believer of rewarding shareholders handsomely, especially through dividend payments. Over the last five years, its annual dividend rate has grown from 81 cents in 2013 to $1.25 in 2017. After 3.5% hike in quarterly dividend rate announced in November 2017, the company’s annual dividend rate stands at $1.28. Moreover, the company’s dividend payout rate has grown from 70.4% in 2013 to 108.7% in 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the industry are Boise Cascade Company (BCC  -  Free Report), Norbord Inc. (OSB  -  Free Report) and Trex Company, Inc. (TREX  -  Free Report). While both Boise Cascade and Norbord sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Trex Company carries a Zacks Rank #2.

154,WY,"Weyerhaeuser Company (WY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the market opens.The wood-based building products manufacturer delivered better-than-expected results in three of the last four reported quarters while lagged in one. Average earnings surprise was a positive 6.04%. Notably, in the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of 31 cents per share came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents.In the last month, the company’s shares have yielded 4.8% return, outperforming the gain of 4.1% recorded by the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for Weyerhaeuser prior to this earnings announcement. Factors Influencing Q1 ResultsWe believe that operating conditions for companies like Weyerhaeuser have been quite favorable for the past few months. Particularly, the housing market in the United States strengthened in the first quarter of 2018, evident from roughly 4.9% sequential growth in housing starts. These along with the demand for repair and remodeling activities, as well as growing domestic and world economy, will be beneficial for the company’s Timberlands and Wood Products segments.Weyerhaeuser’s expectation for the full year will give a rough idea of the factors that might have influenced the quarter’s result. For 2018, it anticipates housing starts (single-family) to increase 10% over the previous year to approximately 1.3 million. Also, anti-dumping duties levied on Canadian softwood lumber producers must be seen positively. Furthermore, efforts to drive operation excellence are predicted to yield benefits of $40-$50 million in 2018 for the Timberlands segment and roughly $40-$60 million for the Wood Products segment.For first-quarter 2018, higher log sales realization and lower fee harvest volume will influence Timberland’s results in the West while higher trucking expenses, flat realizations and lower fee harvest volumes will influence results in the South. Earnings and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are predicted to be comparable with the previous quarter.Softness in sales in Real Estate business and fall in royalties, derived from the Energy and Natural Resources businesses, will impact results for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment in the first quarter. Earnings and adjusted EBITDA is predicted to be lower sequentially.Improvement in operating rates, volumes and sales realizations will influence Wood Products segment’s lumber business while weakness in sales realizations will impact oriented strand board business. Earnings and adjusted EBITDA are predicted to be comparable with the previous quarter.Other concerning factors include industry competition, high debt levels, labor constraints and lack of suitable lot.Earnings WhisperOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

The company anticipates solid housing starts to be roughly 1.3 million in 2018. Also, the improving demand for repair and remodeling activities will propel demand for building products.Strategic Initiatives: Weyerhaeuser’s focus on operational excellence has been advantageous over time. The company reaped benefits of $172 million between 2014 and 2017 from its Timberlands segment while predicting to achieve additional $40-$50 million in 2018. These initiatives yielded benefits of $327 million between 2014 and 2017, from the Wood Products segment.

156,WY,"Blazing threats of global warming have raised panic alarms across the globe, leading to greater consciousness toward building up forestry. Probably this is why a single day has been accommodated since March 21, 2013, to honor the worth of forest reservation.Agreed, it is a socially-conscious idea, but the investing world has a lot to benefit from forestry.  Many companies are engaged in the timber industry. The industry has a low or negative correlation with traditional asset classes. Including this asset class in one’s portfolio provides excellent portfolio diversification, resulting in low volatility of portfolio returns.Investors might be surprised to know that timber ETFs like iShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD  -  Free Report) have easily surpassed broader market indices like the S&P 500 this year. The fund has gained more than 37% in the last one year (as of Mar 20, 2018).Inside the Outperformance Lumber prices have been benefiting from the supply crunch (due to last year’s wildfires in Canada’s British Columbia, the world’s top exporter of softwood lumber) and strained trade relations between Canada and the United States. Last April, President Donald Trump announced a tariff of up to 24% on imports from the Canadian softwood lumber industry.Amid rising prices, U.S. builders are reported to be hoarding lumber ‘for what is expected to be one of the busiest construction seasons in years,’ according to Wall Street Journal. Agreed, housing starts slipped 7.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.236 million units in February, but single-family projects rose for the second consecutive month.Single-family housing units under construction witnessed the highest number in February since June 2008. With single-family homebuilding making up the largest pie of the housing market, the timber industry definitely has a reason see price escalation.Moreover, profits from harvesting wood are subject to low-taxed capital gains.This makes shareholders in forest-product companies organized as REITs enjoy higher current income. Weyerhaeuser Company REIT (WY  -  Free Report) yields about 3.60% annually while Catchmark Timber Trust Inc’s (CTT  -  Free Report) dividend yield is 4.24% (as of Mar 20, 2018).Stock PicksGiven this upbeat backdrop, we have highlighted a few timber-related stocks that investors could consider for a greener portfolio.

157,WY,"Premium engineering and construction firm, Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 72 cents, reflecting a beat of 22%. Overall, Fluor has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 9.9% in the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayFluor’s market diversity remains a key strength that helps it mitigate the cyclicality of markets in which it operates. The company’s strategy of maintaining a good business portfolio mix permits it to focus on the more stable business markets as well as capitalize on developing the cyclical markets at suitable times. The long-term prospects of the company also remain strong with existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for existing coal-fired power plants.The company is poised to grow on the back of its strong track record of receiving awards. The management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in future as well, which is expected to prove conducive to bottom-line growth in the to-be reported quarter as well. The company continues to receive awards for FEED and pre-FEED work for gold, bauxite and copper projects. Based on the present trends, Fluor remains confident that it will secure two major EPC mining projects in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, the company’s continuous focus on cost controls enables it deliver the performance requirements specified by its clients as well as their budgetary needs. Fluor’s current focus on transforming its EPC model into one integrated solution is likely to expand its scope of work on a project, improve client satisfaction and provide an opportunity to generate greater returns.Despite these positives, the fact remains that the widespread macroeconomic challenges have severely restricted the company’s performance for the past several quarters. Sluggish backlog conversion problem has been a persistent crisis in this sector, mainly attributable to uncertain macroeconomic conditions. These conditions are likely to hinder growth to a large extent.This apart, the company bears significant cost overruns risk as the price of several of its contracts is fixed. It may experience reduced profits if costs increase above its estimates, which might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Further, volatility in commodity prices and cyclical nature of the company’s commodity-based business lines, poses significant challenges for Fluor in the upcoming quarters. Other major headwinds include uncertain award timings, weak spending on the part of the clients, intense competition. Also, foreign currency volatility along with complex stick built and construction projects are likely to add to the company’s woes.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Fluor this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +3.19% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Fluor has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.90% and a Zacks Rank #1.

161,WY,"Weyerhaeuser Company (WY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 2, before the market opens.The company delivered better-than-expected results in three of the last four quarters while lagged in one. Average earnings surprise was a positive 7.23%. Notably, last quarter, the company’s earnings of 34 cents per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.68%.In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 2.8% return, underperforming the gain of 6.5% recorded by the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for Weyerhaeuser prior to this earnings announcement. Factors Influencing Q4 ResultsWeyerhaeuser’s businesses, especially its Timberlands and Wood Products operations, are highly dependent on the housing market in the United States.We believe that healthy growth in the U.S. housing market in the fourth quarter must have benefited the company’s quarterly operations. On a month-over-month basis, housing starts increased in October and November but slipped 8.2% in December. Overall, housing starts in the October-December quarter were up roughly 6.7% from the previous quarter. Favorable population and robust labor market will support new construction activities while aging of existing construction will raise demand for repair and remodelling services. Moreover, higher lumber prices are likely to boost sales realization in the quarter.However, high debt levels, industry competition and lack of suitable lot might keep the momentum at bay. Moreover, a drastic fall in demand from China and Japan will prove detrimental to the company’s export businesses.For the fourth quarter, Weyerhaeuser anticipates sequentially higher earnings and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the Timberland and Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources segments.In addition, the company’s ongoing operational initiatives are anticipated to support its results in 2017. It aims to reap a benefit of $40-$50 million in the Timberlands segment and $55-$75 million in the Wood Products segment.

163,WY,"Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report), a preeminent company in the field of high performing building solutions, finalized its acquisition of International Barrier Technology Inc., a company known for manufacturing fire retardant coating used in engineered wood products.On Oct 13, 2017, shares of Louisiana-Pacific gained 0.1% to end at $28.32.Deal DetailsLouisiana-Pacific had planned the purchase of Barrier Technology in July 2017. The agreement finally closed for $22 million, making Barrier Technology a wholly own subsidiary of Louisiana-Pacific.Notably, the buyout will not dishonor Barrier Technology’s current contracts and its service to customers.Will the Buyout Help Louisiana-Pacific?Louisiana-Pacific has been focused on driving its top line by providing quality engineered wood building products that ensure maximum consumer satisfaction. To improve the quality of its engineered wood building products, Louisiana-Pacific saw immense potential in Barrier Technology’s branded product — LP FlameBlock Fire-Rated OSB Sheathing and Blazeguard FR Deck Panel. This particular product is used to make engineered wood fire resistant. In fact, Louisiana-Pacific had already licensed and adopted Barrier Technology’s FlameBlock products at its Clarke County Alabama mill.In the view of increasing demand for fire resistance products in residential and commercial buildings, the Barrier Technology buyout is expected to prove beneficial for the company.Notably, Barrier Technology will operate as part of Louisiana-Pacific’s Oriented Strand Board or OSB business. The OSB segment, constituting 58% of Louisiana-Pacific’s total revenue, is focused on diversification of specialty products. In fact, OSB recorded the best earnings performance in the last quarter after 2006.Moreover, in the last reported quarter, sales at the OSB segment increased 28.6% year over year to $325 million. However, sales volume remained flat year over year, while sales prices increased 26%.In order to drive sales volume in the segment, the company is taking various initiatives to strengthen its product pipeline. In fact, the Barrier Technology acquisition is likely to drive sales at the OSB segment. As per the company, this acquisition will ensure long-term support to Louisiana-Pacific in terms of investments in FlameBlock market development and product sales.Share Price MovementShares of Louisiana-Pacific have outperformed its industry year to date. The stock has gained 49.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 20.6%.The company has witnessed a northward movement in current quarter and year earnings estimate revisions.

164,WY,"We issued an updated research report on Weyerhaeuser Company (WY  -  Free Report) on Jan 2. Strengthening timber, land and forest products business as well as the company’s efforts to improve operational efficiency and provide healthy return to shareholders adds to its advantages. However, the growth momentum might get restricted by headwinds rising from international exposure, global uncertainties and rising costs and debts.Weyerhaeuser currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $26.6 billion.Below we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring WeyerhaeuserStrategic Initiatives Drive Growth Opportunities: Over time, Weyerhaeuser has undertaken some strategic decisions to help it concentrate on its core timber, land and forest products business. In this regard, divestment of liquid packaging board business, printing papers company (North Pacific Paper Company) and Cellulose Fibers pulp mills in 2016 are worth mentioning. Also, the company continued with its efforts in 2017, having divested its timberlands and manufacturing operations in Uruguay to a consortium led by BTG Pactual's Timberland Investment Group in September. Also, the company sold its 21% equity interest in Twin Creeks Timber in October.In addition, Weyerhaeuser’s merger with Plum Creek Timber has enabled it to leverage benefits from the gradually improving housing market in the United States. Housing starts in the country are expected to be roughly 1.2 million in 2017.Attractive Shareholders’ Return: Weyerhaeuser has a sound track record of rewarding its shareholders through lucrative dividend payments. Notably, the company paid dividends of $699 million in the first nine months of 2017, of which roughly $233 million was distributed in the third quarter. In November, the company gifted its shareholders a 3.2% hike in the quarterly dividend rate.We believe such disbursements are reflective of its strong cash position and capital allocation policy. In the long run, the company aims to achieve dividend payout of up to 75% of funds available for distribution.Operational Excellence & Impressive Guidance: We believe that Weyerhaeuser’s ongoing operational initiatives are anticipated to support its results in 2017 (results not yet released). It aims to reap a benefit of $40-$50 million in the Timberlands segment, driven by these initiatives. Benefits of $55-$75 million are expected in the Wood Products segment, including improvement of $20-$25 million in oriented strand board, $20-$25 million in lumber, $10-$15 million in engineered wood products and $5-$10 million in distribution.Weyerhaeuser anticipates sequentially higher earnings and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization from the Timberland segment. Likewise, results in the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segments are predicted to improve sequentially. Also, the company anticipates spending approximately $300 million as capital expenditure for the Wood Products segment while $135 million has been allocated for the Timberlands segment.Factors Working Against WeyerhaeuserPoor Share Price Performance & Valuation: In the last three months, Weyerhaeuser’s shares have yielded 3.3% return, underperforming 5.6% growth of the industry.Also, on a P/E (TTM) basis, Weyerhaeuser looks overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 36x and 28.9x in the last three-month period. This makes us cautious on the stock.Increasing Costs and Huge Debt Levels: Weyerhaeuser is suffering from the risks of escalated costs and expenses. In the first nine months of 2017, the company’s cost of sales increased 7.6% year over year. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses can hurt its margins in the quarters ahead.Also, a high-debt level can lead to heightened financial obligations, posing serious threats to the company’s financial health. Exiting the third quarter, its long-term debt was approximately $5.9 billion.Challenges Arising From Global Uncertainties: Weyerhaeuser’s businesses are highly dependent on the housing market in the United States. Lower level of housing activities and difficult financial conditions in the home country as well as other countries where the company operates will adversely hurt its sales, earnings and cash flow.In addition, business expansion in foreign nations has exposed Weyerhaeuser to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geo-political issues.Earnings Estimates & Stocks to ConsiderWeyerhaeuser’s earnings estimates for 2017 (results not yet released) and 2018 improved in the last 60 days. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.20 for 2017 and $1.31 for 2018, representing growth of 2.6% and 0.8% from their respective tallies 60 days ago.Some stocks worth considering in the industry are Boise Cascade, L.L.C. (BCC  -  Free Report), Rayonier Inc. (RYN  -  Free Report) and Potlatch Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company also communicated the signing of an agreement to dispose 100,000 acres of Southern Timberlands to Twin Creeks.

Additionally, the company became the manager of timberland assets owned by Twin Creeks.Now, Weyerhaeuser has exited as the stakeholder in Twin Creeks for $107.5 million in cash and has agreed on selling 100,000 acres of Southern Timberlands to the latter for $202.5 million cash. The to-be-disposed timberland includes 80,000 acres in Mississippi and 20,000 acres in Georgia. The company anticipates closing its timberland disposition deal by the end of 2017.

166,WY,"Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY  -  Free Report) successfully divested its Uruguay-based timberlands and manufacturing business to a consortium led by BTG Pactual's Timberland Investment Group (“TIG”) on Sep 1. The company secured $402.5-million cash on the closure of the deal and anticipates to incur minimal taxable expenses for the transaction.  Per the deal, Weyerhaeuser has divested more than 300,000 acres of timberlands in North central and Northeastern Uruguay. Moreover, a cogeneration facility, veneer manufacturing plant and a seedling nursery have been sold under this deal.We believe that such diligent spin-off moves will likely strengthen Weyerhaeuser’s inorganic growth trajectory. Over the past few quarters, the company has undertaken a number of strategic decisions to help it concentrate on its core timber, land and forest products business. For instance, it divested its liquid packaging board business, printing papers company (North Pacific Paper Company) and Cellulose Fibers pulp mills in 2016.However, we believe that intense competition from the North American and global producers will mar this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s near-term prospects. In addition, Weyerhaeuser’s Timberlands and Wood Products segments are highly dependent on the U.S. housing market. Thus, any untoward situation influencing the construction and housing sectors will impact the company's financials. Also, increasing debt remains a major concern.Weyerhaeuser’s shares have lost 2%, wider than the loss of 0.4% incurred by the industry, in a month’s time.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:Potlatch Corporation’s (PCH  -  Free Report) earnings are anticipated to grow 5% in the next three to five years.

167,WY,"We issued an updated research report on Universal Forest Products Inc. (UFPI  -  Free Report) on Dec 18. We believe that a diversified business structure, initiatives to return higher value to shareholders and inorganic activities make this stock an attractive choice for investors seeking exposure in the building products space.It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its investment appeal is further accentuated by a favorable VGM Score of B.Universal Forest’s earnings are projected to grow 10% in the next three to five years. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.87 for 2017 and $2.19 for 2018, representing year-over-year growth of 13.3% and 17.1%, respectively.Also, market sentiments have been positive for Universal Forest, with the stock yielding 25% return in the last three months. This gain is above 8.7% growth of the industry it belongs to.Below we discuss why investors should consider buying Universal Forest’s stock.Business Diversification a Boon: Universal Forest — a leading manufacturer and distributor of wood and wood-alternative products — serves retailers, distributors, builders of single and multifamily homes, and others customers in various end markets including retail building material, construction and industrial end markets. Such diversification prevents the company from losses in the event of loss of business from any particular customer.Furthermore, international diversity has played a major role in Universal Forest’s profitability over time. It operates through its subsidiaries in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Strengthening international presence remains a priority for the company.Inorganic Initiatives Drive Growth Opportunities: Acquired assets have over time contributed to Universal Forest’s expansion. Notably, acquired assets contributed roughly 15% to year-over-year sales growth in third-quarter 2017.In May 2017, the company acquired Go Boy Pallets, LLC — engaged in manufacturing and distributing industrial pallets and packaging in Georgia and North Carolina. This buyout has been strengthening the company’s industrial packaging business. Moreover, in March, the company acquired Robbins Manufacturing Company and Quality Hardwood Sales, LLC. These assets have fortified the company’s position in the hardwood products market.Attractive Shareholders’ Return: Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders for Universal Forest. Notably, shares worth $13 million were repurchased while dividend of $9.2 million was distributed in the nine months ended September 2017.In October, the company announced a 13.3% increase in semi-annual dividend rate while it paid stock dividend by issuing two additional common shares for each common share held by the shareholders in November.Solid Near-Term Prospects and Long-Term Targets: Universal Forest is poised to gain from strengthening demand in the U.S. construction market. Also, addition of new customers, new product launches and synergistic benefits from acquired assets are other factors favoring the company. In 2017, the company anticipates generating revenues of $365 million from new products.Over the long term, the company aims to grow sales roughly 4-6% above GDP growth. New product sales are anticipated to constitute at least 10% of total sales while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization growth will exceed unit sales growth. Also, the company anticipates offering high-quality products to its customers, having started new development and testing facilities.Other Stocks to ConsiderUniversal Forest currently carries a market capitalization of $2.3 billion. We believe that the above-mentioned positives clearly justify the stock’s current ranking.Some other stocks worth considering in the industry are Rayonier Inc. (RYN  -  Free Report), Norbord Inc. (OSB  -  Free Report) and Weyerhaeuser Company (WY  -  Free Report). While both Rayonier and Norbord sport a Zacks Rank #1, Weyerhaeuser carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

171,WY,"EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report) has been enjoying solid momentum in non-residential construction demand, along with strong project execution, which has shored up its earnings in recent quarters. In fact, the company has consistently grown its earnings faster than revenues through efficient cost-control measures, over the past couple of years. This has resulted in margin expansion and improving profitability over time.We believe the company has several growth drivers in place and enjoys a robust foothold in its served markets, which will likely help it maintain the growth momentum in the times to come.Investors also seem to think the same, as they have favored this stock in recent times. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has outperformed the industry over the past year, having appreciated 12.1% compared to the industry’s scanty gain of 3.9%.Let’s discuss some of these growth drivers and also shed light on some of the risks that the company is vulnerable to.EMCOR’s revenue growth has been driven by sound performance from the combined U.S. Construction segments, along with solid contribution from the recent acquisitions. In fact, the company posted record gross profit, operating income and net income from continuing operations levels in the recently-reported quarterly results. The company’s earnings beat estimates by a whopping 32.9% and rose an impressive 28.2% year over year.Particularly, the U.S. Mechanical construction segment has been witnessing robust execution. In the third-quarter results, this segment witnessed revenue growth of 7.3%. The U.S. Construction segment sustained its robust momentum and grew 5.9% year over year, while the U.S. Building Services business rose 5.1% year over year.Encouraged by its accretive acquisitions and increasing traction in the U.S. construction space, EMCOR’s management had raised its earnings guidance for 2017 to a range of $3.70-$3.80 (up from previous projections of $3.40-$3.60).Further, EMCOR’s acquisition strategies have been lending momentum to the company’s operations as well. Over time, these buyouts have fortified EMCOR’s market-leading position in electrical construction and services, and expanded its capabilities in the energy and industrial sectors.We are highly optimistic about EMCOR’s recent acquisition of Ardent, which will solidify the company’s position in electrical construction and services, and expand its capabilities in the energy and industrial sectors, particularly in the gulf coast, western and mid-continent regions. The company anticipates the Ardent buyout to be accretive to its 2017 earnings by at least 10 cents per share. This will likely provide a robust boost to the company’s numbers.Furthermore, the executive order signed by Trump last month to accelerate approvals of permits for highways, bridges and other major building efforts (as part of his proposal to spend $1 trillion to fix aging U.S. infrastructure) will provide a boost to EMCOR’s operations.However, the company has been facing headwinds in its U.S. Industrial Services segment, which has been hit by Hurricane Harvey and continues to be vulnerable to the volatility in oil and gas prices. Harvey resulted in lower field service activities as it impacted EMCOR’s customers' facilities in the Texas Louisiana Gulf Coast region. It also led to the previously scheduled maintenance turnaround work being delayed or deferred. The impact of the disruption caused by the tropical storm will likely be seen in the coming couple of quarters as well.However, we believe the company’s diversified business structure, along with its concerted efforts to explore beyond traditional shop-related operations for tapping other profitable areas like food processing and power, will drive long-term growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome top-ranked stocks in the broader space are MasTec, Inc. (MTZ  -  Free Report), Weyerhaeuser Company (WY  -  Free Report) and Sterling Construction Company Inc (STRL  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.MasTec generated four outstanding beats over the trailing four quarters, for an impressive average positive surprise of 28.1%.Weyerhaeuser has beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, and generated an average positive surprise of 7.2% during the same period.Sterling Construction has a striking earnings surprise history for the same time frame, having beaten estimates thrice for an average beat of 65.2%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

175,WY,"With the Q2 earnings season taking center stage, investors are all eagerly waiting to note the daily beats and misses of mega companies.Our latest Earnings Trend reveals that 117 S&P 500 companies (accounting for 44.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) have reported earnings till Jul 26, with 78.9% topping earnings per share estimates and 70.8% coming in ahead of top-line expectations.Overall performance of the Q2 reporting cycle has been fairly good till now. The broad-based momentum has been stemmed by the better-than-expected results of companies reporting earnings in recent days.  We currently anticipate that earnings and revenues of all the S&P 500 stocks would increase 8.7% and 4.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.While reckoning the performance of wood stocks, we believe that the improving U.S. housing market scenario would likely boost results in the second quarter. Tailwinds like an improved job market picture and upbeat consumer confidence are recovering housing market conditions in the country.Zacks CounselAccording to the Zacks Industry classification, wood stocks are broadly grouped under the construction sector, one of the 16 Zacks sectors.Our latest Earnings Trend (dated Jul 26, 2017) states that roughly 46.2% of the Construction stocks in the S&P 500 Group have reported results for this quarter, recording 9.8% rise in earnings and 15.2% upside in revenues on a year-over-year basis.We project that both earnings and revenues of all the construction stocks in the S&P 500 Group would increase 17% and 9.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.What's in the Cards for these 2 Wood Stocks?Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results, before the market opens. The company’s average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 1.28%. However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Weyerhaeuser will likely beat estimates in this quarter.

176,WY,"Weyerhaeuser Company (WY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28, before the market opens.The company’s financial performance in the last four quarters was mixed, surpassing estimates in two and lagging in others. Average earnings surprise was a positive 1.28%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of 22 cents per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.2%.We believe that sound financial performance and growth prospects lifted investor sentiments for the company. In the last one month, the company’s shares have yielded 3.87% return, outperforming the gain of 2.17% recorded by the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for Weyerhaeuser prior to this earnings announcement.Factors Influencing Q2 ResultsWe believe that Weyerhaeuser is likely to benefit from improving housing market conditions in the U.S. Notably, the U.S. Census Bureau report revealed 8.3% month-over-month increase in housing starts in Jun 2017. The improvement was primarily driven by higher housing starts in the Northeast, the Midwest and the West. Also, housing completions in the month grew 5.2%. For 2017, housing starts in the U.S. is anticipated to be within 1.25−1.3 million. Single-family starts will be over 10%.  For the second quarter, the company predicts sequentially higher earnings for the Wood Products segment on the back of higher sales volumes and average sales realizations. Also, it anticipates realizing operating expenses benefits from the Timberland and Wood Products segments.Anticipated realizations of synergistic benefits from the merger with Plum Creek Timber will likely drive Weyerhaeuser’s results in the quarter. Also, the company made strategic divestments of liquid packaging board business, printing papers company and Cellulose Fibers pulp mills in the past few quarters. These, as well as pending disposal of Uruguay-based timberlands and manufacturing business will help it concentrate on its core timber, land and forest products business. This, in turn, will lead to rise in the company’s profitability.On the flip side, headwinds like skilled labor shortages, lack of suitable lot and mortgage availability, high debt levels, unfavorable foreign currency movements and industry competition might limit growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show that Weyerhaeuser will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely earnings beat. This is not the case here as elaborated below:(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.) Zacks ESP: Weyerhaeuser currently has an Earnings ESP of -7.41% for the quarter. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 25 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.Weyerhaeuser Company Price and EPS Surprise  Weyerhaeuser Company Price and EPS Surprise | Weyerhaeuser Company QuoteZacks Rank: Weyerhaeuser’s Zacks Rank #2 when combined with a negative ESP makes an earnings beat prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the industry you may want to consider, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  TRI Pointe Group, Inc. (TPH  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.JELD-WEN Holding, Inc. (JELD  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #2.Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +3.28% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.   See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

The growth was primarily triggered by synergistic benefits from acquisition of idX Corporation (closed in Sep 2016) as well as healthy businesses from new and existing customers.Housing and Construction sales (27.1%) were $295.2 million, up 17% year over year due to impressive businesses from residential construction, manufactured housing and commercial customers.MarginsUniversal Forest Products’ margin profile suffered from higher costs and expenses.

Going by the Zacks model, companies sporting a Zacks Rank #1 have strong chances of outperforming the broader market.Year to date, Weyerhaeuser’s shares have yielded nearly 11% return, outperforming the gain of 9.01% recorded by the Zacks categorized Building Products industry.   Why the Upgrade?We believe that Weyerhaeuser stands to benefit from an improving housing market in the U.S. For 2017, the company projects housing starts to be roughly 1.25−1.30 million. To better serve its customers through improved products and services, it has planned capital spending of approximately $435 million for 2017.

In 2016, the company divested its liquid packaging board business, printing papers company (North Pacific Paper Company) and Cellulose Fibers pulp mills. It continued its efforts in 2017 as well. In June, it signed a deal to divest its Uruguay-based timberlands and manufacturing business, including more than 300,000 acres of timberlands in north central and northeastern Uruguay, co-generation facility, plywood and veneer manufacturing facility, and a seedling nursery.In addition, Weyerhaeuser’s cost-savings measures are likely to yield benefits of $95−$125 million in 2017. On a segmental basis, operating expense benefits will likely be in a $40−$50 million range for the Timberland segment, $55−$75 million for the Wood Products segment, including roughly $20−$25 million in OSB, $20−$25 million in lumber, $10−$15 million in engineered wood products and $5−$10 million in distribution.  Over the last 60 days, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate increased 1% to $1.02 for 2017.

179,WY,"Investors interested in Building Products - Wood stocks are likely familiar with Louisiana-Pacific (LPX  -  Free Report) and Weyerhaeuser (WY  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Louisiana-Pacific and Weyerhaeuser are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.LPX currently has a forward P/E ratio of 9.49, while WY has a forward P/E of 24.78. We also note that LPX has a PEG ratio of 1.90. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. WY currently has a PEG ratio of 4.96.Another notable valuation metric for LPX is its P/B ratio of 2.42. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.
