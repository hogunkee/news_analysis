Also understand that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one.

Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran.

Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE).

Shares of Nike leapt 11% Friday, hitting a new high.Harley-Davidson faced a double-whammy in the past week, first getting hit with a 25% tariff from the European Union, then getting slammed by President Trump for waving the ""white flag."" The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%.

Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion.

22,CCL,"Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Broadcom (AVGO) are three stocks that show why $1.7 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) is smart for using two oars rather than just one.The fund's management is divvied up between two teams, one tilting toward value-oriented stock, the other toward growth stocks. Last year, when the postelection Trump Bump lifted value-oriented stocks like energy and financials, bets in those sectors boosted the fund's value-oriented sleeve. This year it's the growth sleeve's turn to shine brighter.And with year-to-date gains of 34% for both Amazon and Facebook and 39% for Broadcom going into Thursday, those stocks have added octane to the growth sleeve's fuel. So have consumer discretionary names like Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH). And likewise for health care names like Hologic (HOLX) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The fund aims for a 60%-40% split in assets between its growth and value sleeves. ""That split makes sense in achieving a core fund experience for our shareholders,"" said USAA's Wasif Latif, who oversees the teams running the two sleeves. Subadvisors from Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss run the value sleeve. An in-house team from USAA mans the growth sleeve.Most of the fund's dividend comes from the Barrow Hanley sleeve.The tandem arrangement has resulted in a 23.46% return over the 12 months going into Thursday, topping 95% of its large-cap-blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500 was up 19.06%.So far this year, the fund is up 9.74% vs. 8.82% for its peer group and 9.86% for the big-cap bogey.John Jares, who runs the growth sleeve along with John Toohey, likes Amazon's strength in retail and web services. ""It's referred to as Hurricane Amazon because it's so disruptive,"" he said. Amazon Web Services' operating margin soared to 24.3% as of the first quarter, up from 3.8% in 2014. It's expected to hit 29% by the end of 2017, he says. With AWS' profit growing much faster than the overall company's, the overall company's operating margin will be pulled up by AWS, Jares adds. And its rapidly growing free cash flow will give the company ""more ammunition to invest against any of its competitors,"" he said.He's less enthused about Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), wondering what role it will play in Amazon's future.His team is crunching numbers to decide whether investors have oversold other grocery chains. The fund also owns Kroger (KR).Jares likes the way Facebook has become a magnet for advertising dollars, largely by providing advertisers with sharper targeting of consumers. ""They can see the effectiveness of ad campaigns,"" Jares said. And Facebook can post additional ads at minimal cost. ""That's what attracted us to the stock,"" he said.The stock is trading around 153. Jares says 200 is not out of the range of possibility.A third cruise ship line that the fund owns is Carnival (CCL). ""The cruise lines have been on a tear this year,"" he said, referring to all three of his cruise ship stocks. ""Because of improved demand, they've had better pricing. Last year, there were problems from terrorism in Europe, fears about the Zika virus. With the improvement in employment and the future economic outlook of the U.S., cruise lines have seen rising demand. Plus, they've enjoyed easy comps (earnings comparisons) from last year.""Royal Caribbean is up 39% so far this year. Earnings per share grew 13%, 31% and 74% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Royal Caribbean ranks No. 3 in the Leisure-Services industry group. It has four straight years of annual earnings per share growth. Norwegian ranks No. 6 in the group. You can compare the two stocks fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy to use Stock Checkup tool.Norwegian, trading around 55, is up 29% this year. The stock is within its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.In health care, Jares says his team likes Hologic because relatively new CEO Stephen MacMillan is shifting the company to a faster growth profile serving female health, diagnostics and aesthetics.The team's view of UnitedHealth is that investors have underappreciated its Optum division, which includes a number of fast-growing ancillary businesses that improve the effectiveness of their standard insurance business.Building materials maker Owens Corning (OC), in the Barrow Hanley sleeve, is up 30% this year. EPS grew 9% and 60% the past two quarters. The stock has been driven by the housing rebound and strength in the U.S. economy.Michael Nayfa, a manager of the Barrow Hanley sleeve, said, ""Underlying fundamentals remain strong in the roofing and composite businesses, and the insulation business looks set to recover in 2017 as housing starts remain below normal and pricing is picking up. OC remains an attractive value trading at 14 times normalized earnings with a 1.2% dividend yield.""RELATED: Microsoft would surpass Amazon Web ServicesUSAA Growth & Income Fund Shows Two Heads Are Better Than OneHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

The tweet asserted the shutdown was due to the service's lack of policing of negative content.Shares of both Sina (an IBD 50 stock) and Weibo are in four- to five-week-long shallow consolidations, following breakouts in mid-May. Neither suffered any real chart damage, holding well above their 10-week moving averages following Thursday's early decline.Staples (SPLS) leapt 5% following news reports late Wednesday that private equity firm Sycamore Partners was in late-stage talks to acquire the office products retailer. A deal could top $6 billion, reports said, and could be announced as early as next week.Window wall maker Apogee Enterprises climbed 2% at the start of trade after reporting narrow beats in its fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings, and raising full-year earnings guidance to well above analyst targets.  The stock remained just below a 58.73 cup-with-handle buy point.Steel products maker Commercial Metals (CMC) rolled out a 4% gain at the open, after reporting a solid sales and earnings beat in its fiscal third-quarter results.

24,CCL,"Carnival (CCL) shares were up incrementally on a solid beat-and-raise quarter from the cruise-ship operator.Earnings dipped 3% to 38 cents a share — notching a lighter fall than expected — as analysts were expecting 35 cents in per-share profit. Revenue grew 4% to $3.79 billion, topping forecasts for $3.78 billion. Shares were up 0.7% to 59.26 at the close.""Our performance was driven by increased demand, particularly for our core Caribbean itineraries, leading to higher year-over-year ticket prices which enabled us to overcome the significant negative impact of both fuel and currency to exceed the high end of our guidance range,"" said Carnival Chief Executive Arnold Donald in a statement.The company's peak booking period was ""strong,"" he said, ""leaving us well positioned with bookings at considerably higher prices and with less inventory remaining for sale in 2017 compared to the prior year, resulting in increased earnings guidance.""For fiscal 2017, Carnival now expects 3% in constant-currency net revenue yields, up from December guidance of 2.5%, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.50-$3.70, up from prior outlook for $3.30-$3.60. That exceeds current Wall Street forecasts for earnings of $3.61 a share for the year.Carnival defines the ""net revenue yield"" metric as net revenue per available berth day, minus airfare costs and travel agent fees.For the current quarter, the company expects 2.5%-3.5% net revenue yields and earnings of 43-47 cents a share, the midpoint of which is a little lighter than views for 46 cents a share.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) climbed 0.6% to 51.30.

29,CCL,"Planet Fitness (PLNT) has bulked up since its August 2015 initial public offering, thanks to a $10 per month fee, along with a catchy slogan that promises members a judgment-free setting with what it likes to call ""no gymtimidation.""It's a formula that seems to be working, as the chain boasts more than 8.7 million members and 1,200 facilities as of the third quarter.Macquarie analyst Matthew Brooks calls Planet Fitness the Domino's Pizza (DPZ) of gyms, lamenting that he doesn't own a franchise in a Jan. 10 research report. Buy like you would a pizza franchise, he suggests.""The biggest pushback on Planet Fitness is the gym business 'sucks,'"" he wrote. ""We get the comments from investors with experience but who are basing their comments more on what other listed gyms have done and not after going through the Planet Fitness model.""And therein lies the difference: ""Planet Fitness is not a gym,"" Brooks said.It's a franchise with 1,242 facilities as of Sept. 30, the day Planet Fitness wrapped up its third quarter. The number of facilities grew 22% year-over-year during that three-month period with membership running up 21%.Brooks says there is ""clear evidence"" the Planet Fitness model works. Low cost plus a judgment-free environment equals share gain.Investors seem to agree. Planet Fitness stock finished 2016 up 44% and shares have climbed nearly 7% year-to-date. Shares have been creating a flat base with a 22.17 entry point since mid-November. The stock inched down 4 cents Monday to close at 21.45.To that end, Planet Fitness stock has easily outperformed Investor's Business Daily's 31-company Leisure-Services industry group which ended 2016 up 4.4%. Shares for the group are up nearly 6% since New Year's Day. The group includes the likes of Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Six Flags Entertainment (SIX).But there is only one other gym in the group, Town Sports International (CLUB), which owns New York Sports Club and Boston Sports Club. Town Sports's $76 million market cap pales in comparison with Planet Fitness' $1.1 billion. Town Sports shares are up 14% for the year, but that's partly because the stock is trading below 3.Planet Fitness was established in 1992 when former Chief Executive Michael Grondahl acquired a struggling gym and reduced prices to compete with bigger box gyms, according to Entrepreneur.com. Grondahl grew the business by focusing on first-time gym patrons.Since then, Planet Fitness has expanded nationwide and is dabbling with facilities in Canada and the Dominican Republic via a franchise program that began in 2003. Each gym is considered a ""judgment-free zone"" and even has a ""lunk alarm"" to discourage grunting and dropping weights.""It doesn't matter if your legs have never seen a squat machine before,"" according to Planet Fitness' website. ""We believe no one should ever feel Gymtimidated by Lunky behavior and that everyone should feel at ease in our gyms, no matter what his or her workout goals are.""Grondahl stepped down in 2013 after most of Planet Fitness was sold to investment firm TSG Consumer Partners. Chris Rondeau, a 20-year veteran of the company, was named CEO. TSG sold 4 million shares during the company's IPO in 2015 and held several major sales last year.As of November, records show TSG holds 31.3% of the stock.It has been Rondeau who maintained Planet Fitness' ""no gymtimidation"" standard and $10 monthly fee amid its far-reaching expansion.Jefferies analyst Randal Konik is bullish that Planet Fitness can expand to 4,000 U.S. stores and sees ""strong potential for other areas of growth."" Planet Fitness management has said it's now looking at expanding in Europe and South America where it will likely have to license the business.On the third-quarter conference call with analysts, Rondeau said competitors are struggling to match Planet Fitness. Rivals who encroached on Planet Fitness' turf five years ago with 10-20 stores are now ""looking for a way out because they just can't compete with us in our space.""IBD'S TAKE: Analysts are calling for newbie IPO Planet Fitness to deliver 216% earnings growth in the fourth quarter when the company issues its quarterly report in March. But Planet Fitness isn't alone in major stock and earnings performance following its IPO. Check out IBD Stock Analysis for other big ideas.Konik noted as much in a Jan. 10 report. No rival seems able to keep up with Planet Fitness' vigorous expansion. With more than 1,000 facilities already committed to be built by franchisees, competitors are left lagging, he wrote.""Planet Fitness' scale, reach, size and value are proving impossible to replicate and the moat widens with each new mound of dirt that is moved to build a new unit in the solar system,"" he wrote. ""The competition just can't keep up.""On a year-over-year basis, Planet Fitness' sales grew 38.5% to $87.01 million in third quarter, and 16 cents earnings per share minus items was up 60%. But that was the first period those metrics could be measured vs. the year before. Sequentially, sales and earnings per share haven't been as smooth, with both dipping in the third quarter and the first.Still, Guggenheim analyst John Heinbockel is encouraged by Planet Fitness' ability to generate free cash flow. In November, Planet Fitness used $150 million on adjusted earnings and $17 million on capital expenditures to give shareholders a $275 million special dividend.By mid-2018, Planet Fitness should be a similar position to return some cash to shareholders, Heinbockel wrote in a Dec. 30 report. He rates Planet Fitness stock with a buy and has a 24 price target. He expects Planet Fitness to smartly leverage its $40 million ad fund, which is growing 20% annually.The monthly fee remains a predictable $10, but Planet Fitness could bump its annual fee above $39 — after all, it was once $29, Macquarie's Brooks wrote. Still, the company is likely to keep members coming in with monthly pizza nights, bagel mornings and Tootsie Rolls on demand.If that's not enough, the laid-back attitude might be. Heinbockel notes a new ad campaign likely to resonate well after a particularly divisive presidential election. The ad, combined with a compelling $1 joining fee in January, likely boosted first-quarter sales, he said.The new slogan? ""The world judges. We don't. At Planet Fitness, be free.""RELATEDWhich 3 New IPOs Show Superior Return On Equity?How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food

30,CCL,"LAS VEGAS — Cruise line operator Carnival (CCL) soon will demonstrate what's possible with wireless mobile identification technologies using the closed environments of its ocean cruise ships.On Thursday, during the first official day of the annual CES consumer technology trade show, Carnival CEO Arnold Donald announced that his vacation company will deploy wireless technology and associated interactive display screens on its more than 100 ships to personalize the cruise experience for passengers. Company shares moved back into the buy zone on Thursday as well.Each passenger will receive a small medallion that they can wear on a wristband or necklace. The medallion uses Bluetooth and near-field communications (NFC) wireless technology to open stateroom doors, make payments and be quickly identified by restaurant staff and other crew members.Carnival CEO Donald was seen as an odd choice for the CES opening-day keynote slot, but the applications it plans to roll out for its customers mirror what many other consumer-facing companies are working to provide.IBD'S TAKE: What stocks are rising or falling fast at any given time? IBD's Stocks on the Move provides timely information on heavy institutional buying or selling.Carnival said it will go live with its medallion service, called Ocean (One Cruise Experience Access Network), on its Regal Princess ship on Nov. 13. It will be followed by Royal Princess and Caribbean Princess in early 2018. Carnival plans to roll out the service across its entire Princess Cruises fleet over several years.""We are innovating for a better customer experience,"" Donald said. He said the Ocean Medallion service ""will redefine travel as we know it.""Cruise ship passengers will only need their medallion wristband or necklace on board. It acts as their ID, credit card and access pass. They can use it to interact with ship displays for personalized information and recommendations.The quarter-sized, 1.8-ounce disc has no on-off button and needs no charging. On board Carnival cruise ships, the medallions interact with a network of sensors and computing devices.The medallions are sent to cruise passengers ahead of their trips so they can customize their preferences on them.Carnival stock rose 1.7% to 53.71 on the stock market today, hitting a nearly one-year high. Shares were back in a buy zone from a 53.40 buy point first touched on Nov. 29, out of a cup base.

31,CCL,"Fresh from a holiday season that saw 4K ultra-HD TVs and Amazon (AMZN) Echo smart speakers among the hot-selling items, the consumer electronics industry is about to make its annual splash to show off its candidates for the Next Big Thing.At CES 2017, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and voice-controlled technology are expected to be among the hot topics of conversation.The annual consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas officially runs Jan. 5 — 8, but preshow events start Tuesday.Produced by the Consumer Technology Association, CES will be celebrating its 50th anniversary with the 2017 show.The CTA expects the massive industry confab to draw more than 165,000 attendees and over 3,800 exhibitors covering more than 2.5 million net square feet of floor space. But the association is known for providing conservative guidance. CES 2016 reached a new attendance record, attracting 177,393 industry professionals from 158 countries. Organizers have been working to limit overall attendance to keep the show more manageable.CES 2016 played host to 3,886 exhibiting companies, and they took up nearly 2.5 million net square feet of exhibit space.CES 2017 will feature a diverse set of keynote speakers including the chief executives of cruise line operator Carnival (CCL), sports apparel maker Under Armour (UA) and graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).IBD'S TAKE: Has Nvidia peaked? The graphics and automotive chipmaker had its biggest decline of the year on Wednesday and continued falling Thursday. Even with that, though, shares have tripled this year and it remains No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks, a feature that should be on your regular checklist.At CES 2016, fitness wearables, drones, virtual reality, self-driving cars and hoverboards were headliners.The latest advancements of those technologies will be on display at CES 2017, but the tech press always gravitates to the next shiny new thing. After all, what's new is the nature of the news business.Six years ago, CES exhibitors en masse started labeling all their products as smart because they included a processor and connected to the internet. This year, companies are marketing their products as having artificial intelligence, or AI.Among the products at the show being promoted as having AI include cameras, drones, robots, autonomous cars, and even toothbrushes and patio umbrellas.""Artificial intelligence has the potential to be the story of the show,"" John Curran, managing director of Accenture's (ACN) Communications, Media and Technology business told IBD. ""It could be the golden thread that weaves together so much of what's happening at the show.""AI looks to be a core piece of many product categories, combining Big Data analytics, machine learning and natural language processing, he said. AI allows for easy access to information and device controls as well as predictive capabilities for personalized experiences, Curran said.Another big theme of CES 2017 is expected to be products with voice controls and virtual personal assistants.Amazon is poised to dominate the show with its Alexa voice-response technology, which powers its Echo smart speakers. Amazon is working to make Alexa a standard interface across a range of consumer electronics devices.Companies at CES will be demonstrating Alexa voice controls in such products as air purifiers, smartwatches, speakers and sprinkler systems.Amazon is even hosting a series of educational sessions at CES on building next-generation voice interfaces with Alexa.Rival voice-based digital butlers, such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home and Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana also will be making their presence felt at the show.""One of the stories to watch at CES will be the platform aspects of these intelligent assistants,"" Curran said.Expect to hear about a lot of product partnerships using intelligent assistants from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and possibly Apple's (AAPL) Siri as those platforms seek to become standards in the home.""This has the potential to be a game changer and unlock a wave of innovation,"" Curran said.Intelligent assistants could spur sales of smart home devices and appliances such as connected thermostats, lighting and home security, he said.Augmented reality systems will be on display at CES 2017 for smartphones, smart glasses, toys, automotive head-up displays and other gadgets. Augmented reality overlays digitally created content into the user's real-world environment.""There's going to be a lot of virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality"" at CES 2017, Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News told IBD. ""There are going to be 360-degree cameras so people can create their own content (for VR headsets).""Major chip companies, which provide enabling technologies for consumer electronics, will be touting their latest advances at the show. Intel (INTC), Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM) are among those planning a big presence at the CES 2017.Major car companies including Ford (F), Honda (HMC), Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) also are exhibiting at the show, as are auto tech suppliers such as Mobileye (MBLY), Continental and Valeo (VLEEY).As usual, there are some big no-shows among exhibitors at CES, including Apple and Microsoft, which prefer to do their own product events.Big-screen TVs will remain a staple of the show, with major vendors expected to show off super-crisp OLED TVs and lower-priced 4K TVs with high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging.RELATED:Amazon Gets Big Boost For Echo As Microsoft Readies A Rival DeviceThe Top Selling Products On Amazon Over Holidays Came From ...

33,CCL,"In an era when more than 80% of the active managers fail to beat their benchmark index, finding a mutual fund that consistently achieves the elusive element of alpha is akin to finding the Holy Grail.USAA Growth Fund (USAAX) is one of those funds. This portfolio of large-cap growth stocks has beaten its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. year to date, as well as in the past one, three, five and 10 years. And it has beaten the S&P 500 stock index in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2015, it returned 5.63% vs. the S&P's 1.38%.Lately much of its outperformance has been driven by such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alibaba (BABA).The portfolio managers are Michael Schroer of Renaissance Investment Management and Aziz Hamzaogullari of Loomis Sayles. They each separately manage half the portfolio. Schroer has been with the fund since 1991 and Hamzaogullari since 2010.The fund's strategy is to look for high-quality companies that can generate sustainable and profitable growth. When the managers see stocks selling at a significant discount to their estimate of intrinsic value, they snap them up. This leads to a small portfolio of just 92 companies. The fund also has a very long-term investment horizon, seen in its 31% portfolio turnover rate.Still, even a fund that consistently outperforms has moments when it doesn't. So far this year, it's underperforming the S&P 500 5.90% to 6.61%.""We favor companies that are high quality growth selling at a reasonable valuation,"" said Schroer. ""In the first half of the year lower P/E growth didn't do well. Higher P/E companies led the market, but by the later part of the year that reversed and lower P/E companies are doing better and we've benefited from that. We're in the sweet spot for the market where lower P/E, higher quality are doing better.""Another part of the strategy, this one favored by the Loomis Sayles team, is described as high ""active share."" Active share is a way of measuring how much a portfolio differs from its benchmark index. ""Our active share has been at or above 80%,"" Hamzaogullari told IBD late last year. ""While it does not ensure outperformance, we believe it is a necessary condition for generating alpha and outperforming the benchmark, net of fees, over the long term.""U.S. stocks make up 90% of the fund, with the rest in foreign equities. Technology makes up 27% of the portfolio.Amazon as of July 31 stood as USAA Growth's largest holding, at about 4% of assets. The stock made up the entire retail-internet segment of the fund. Amazon is up 21% this year, sitting just above support at its 50-day moving average after pulling back 3% from its all time high set Oct. 6. Analysts expect Amazon to post Q3 earnings 371% higher than a year earlier when it reports results Thursday.Facebook is the No. 2 holding also at about 4% of assets. The social networking and media leader is up 24% year to date near the 28.43 buy point of a flat base. Fiscal Q1 earnings are expected to rise 70% from a year earlier when results are reported, expected Nov. 2 after the market's close.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giants and another top fund holding, is up 28% so far this year. The stock has found support at its 50-day moving average, 6% below its 52-week high. The company is expect to show a fiscal Q2 earnings increase of 23% when it reports Tuesday.Not all USAA Growth top holdings have been barn burners. Database bellwether Oracle (ORCL) is up 5% this year. It's been in the fund since 2007.The rest of the top 10 holdings and their percentages are: Cisco Systems (CSCO), 3.24%; Visa (V), 3.11%; Qualcomm (QCOM), 2.89%; Monster Beverage (MNST), 2.52%; Alphabet (GOOGL), 2.48%; United Parcel Services (UPS), 2.37%.""We think technology and consumer discretionary look attractive,"" said Schroer. ""Health care still looks attractive. Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) still look very cheap. In this market there are still high quality companies.""Schroer likes Foot Locker (FL). The athletic shoe retailer posted very good second-quarter sales and still trades at a ""very reasonable multiple of 14."" The stock is up only 4.4% this year.""Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) and both are doing well over the last several months,"" said Schroer. ""They had sold off on fears of the Zika virus hurting tourism, but they didn't suffer too much. Now bookings for next year are running high and multiples are very attractive, Royal's trailing P-E is 13 and Carnival's is 14.""We've taken some things off the table, but we still think there are selective opportunities in this market,"" he said. ""We've gone through six quarters of negative earnings growth and we're watching this quarter carefully for signs of a rebound. So far, so good.""RELATED:Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On Facebook And Other Stock LeadersChinese, Other Foreign Stocks Drove Top Q3 Fund PerformersAlibaba Sets Stage For Big Online Shopping Spree

Bats operates one of the largest electronic stock exchanges in the U.S.Bats shares fell 3.5% in heavy volume. The stock remains above the 29.11 buy point of a breakout Friday, when word of the deal first started to filter out. With an acquisition agreement in place, Bats shares may not move much more in either direction. CBOE shares fell 3% below the 69.58 buy point of a cup with handle.Twitter (TWTR) slipped 3% in busy trading, as the stock gave back a modest portion of Friday's 21% surge.

"
39,CCL,"Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) on Tuesday slashed its earnings forecast for this year and said it would miss its profit target for next year, partly due to ""continued weak demand"" for European travel among core North American consumers and Brexit's impact on the pound.Shares plunged 11.8% to close at 37.91 in the stock market today, a day after the stock had begun to find support at its key 50-day line. Rival cruise line Royal Caribbean (RCL) sank 6.8%, and Carnival (CCL) was underwater by 3%.Norwegian's announcement comes amid more intense global anxiety, with some U.S. consumers thinking twice about traveling following ISIS-inspired violence worldwide over the past year, as well as heightened economic uncertainty and an often unpredictable, vitriolic election season.The cruise service cut its 2016 earnings-per-share outlook to $3.35-$3.45 from an earlier projection of $3.65-$3.85. The new forecast was below analyst expectations for $3.72.The company also cut its full-year forecast for adjusted net yield -- an important metric that gauges sales compared to available ships and space on them -- to around 1% growth. In May, the company had forecast an increase of around 3.5%.""Overall, while investors have been bracing for an ugly guide, this was probably short of even lowered expectations, particularly on the yield front,"" Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Higher fuel costs, fare cuts and travelers' uncertainty over their finances, health and safety could pose considerable headwinds to travel-related stocks. See how other travel names are doing at IBD's Stock Checkup. The company's third-quarter earnings guidance of $1.57-$1.62 a share was also well below views for $1.78.The second quarter, however, wasn't as bad, despite weak travel demand.Earnings per share during the second quarter rose 13% to 85 cents, topping estimates by a penny. Revenue increased 9.3% to $1.186 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts for $1.218 billion.Norwegian said it has tried to keep fare discounting at a minimum, something with which the airline industry has also grappled.""While successive geopolitical events dampened North American consumer demand primarily for our Mediterranean itineraries, our management team worked diligently to identify cost saving opportunities to partially mitigate these impacts and generate solid adjusted (earnings-per-share) growth of 13%,"" Chief Executive Frank Del Rio said in a prepared statement.
"
40,CCL,"The consumer stock sell-off intensified and broadened Tuesday, as bad news from General Motors (GM) added to concerns from McDonald's (MCD), Ford Motor (F) and others.The consumer slide fueled a general market retreat. But it's also a warning for the broader U.S. economy.Recent economic data on consumers have been positive. Consumer spending rose at a robust 4.2% annual rate in the second quarter, with a Tuesday report showing a 0.4% monthly gain in June. But consumers were a rare bright spot, with business investment falling for a third straight quarter and homebuilding spending also falling. If consumer spending falters, the economy may struggle to match its anemic second-quarter growth of 1.2%.General Motors and Ford reported July U.S. sales that fell vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCAU) eked out a gain, but less than expected. Ford had reported weak earnings last week amid rising incentives spending and stalling U.S. demand. It sees U.S. industry sales falling in 2016 and 2017 after years of big gains.General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler shares fell 4.4%, 4.3% and 4%, respectively, on the stock market today.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which has been a top-rated restaurant stock, fell 12.4% Tuesday. The steakhouse chain missed on second-quarter revenue and said same-store sales growth was slowing in the early weeks of the current third quarter. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) dived 5.6%, taking a round trip on its breakout.Those follow weaker demand at McDonald's, which had been a great turnaround story in recent months. But last week McDonald's said U.S. comps in the second quarter fell short of Wall Street forecasts, and cited ""softening industry growth."" Starbucks (SBUX) also reported weak U.S. comps.More generally, analysts have been issuing warnings about the retail sector.McDonald's fell 0.3% Tuesday and Starbucks 1.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Texas Roadhouse and Dave & Buster's have been among the best-rated restaurant stocks in recent weeks. For a complete look at these stocks and other consumer giants, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) cut its 2016 outlook Tuesday, citing higher fuel costs and the weak British pound following the Brexit vote. Royal Caribbean stock sank 6.3% Tuesday. Carnival (CCL) lost 3.1%.Airlines sold off Tuesday as Delta Air Lines (DAL) said unit revenue fell sharply in July. Also hitting the sector: A Zika virus warning for a Miami neighborhood and  German carrier Lufthansa saying that terror attacks and global unease have had a ""tangible"" impact on demand. Delta Air stock fell more than 7% intraday, while American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell 6%.Department stores were among the biggest losers, with Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) down 8% and Nordstrom (JWN) tumbling 7%.Kroger got a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform, citing the deflationary environment for groceries. Shares are off 4.1%, on track for their lowest close since early January 2015. That follows weak same-store sales from natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM).One relative bright spot for consumer stocks has been consumer products producers such as Procter & Gamble (PG). P&G edged past profit views Tuesday, rising 0.4% to 86.78 for a 52-week high. But Procter & Gamble and other consumer- and food-product giants have been relying on cost cuts to offset declining revenue.

41,CCL,"Shares of Carnival (CCL) reported second-quarter results that topped expectations and stuck to its guidance despite rising fuel costs and sinking currencies.The cruise operator's earnings per share during the quarter nearly doubled to 49 cents, beating views by a dime. Revenue rose 3.2% to $3.7 billion, narrowly passing views for $3.68 billion.The results came despite weaker currencies against the dollar and higher fuel prices. Chief Executive Arnold Donald praised the company's attempts to drive demand ""in excess of our measured capacity growth.""The company said that higher demand and growth discipline in a tough environment helped it hold the midpoint of its full-year earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.35 a share, a narrower range than forecast in March but still $3.30 at its midpoint. Analysts expect $3.38.Carnival has tried to tap into an older U.S. population with more time to travel. It has also focused more on China, as the Caribbean becomes jam-packed with rivals.Shares closed up 0.2%, giving up steeper gains, on the stock market today. Royal Caribbean (RCL) dipped 0.5%.

42,CCL,"Delta Air Lines (DAL), Carnival (CCL), Expedia (EXPE) and other travel-related stocks plunged early Friday after a suspected terror attack left more than 80 people dead in southern France, but many pared losses.Delta shares fell 2.4% to 39.98 in the stock market today. The airline has the most exposure to France of any U.S. airline. American Airlines (AAL) stock erased losses and turned up 1 cent. United Continental (UAL) was off just 0.9%. All three carriers are up sharply for the week.Hilton Worldwide (HLT) shares rose 0.3%. Marriott (MAR) dipped 0.35% and Hyatt Hotels (H) turned up 0.3%.Travel booking site Expedia shares edged down 0.4%. Priceline (PCLN) shares fell 1.2%.Among cruise lines, Carnival fell 2.2%, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) 3.7% and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) 2.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Most industry groups in the travel and leisure sector are well off highs, but have mounted a rebound of late. Airlines are back up to early June levels after dipping for much of the last month. Hotels recovered to March levels after a four-month drought. The travel booking sector that includes Priceline and Expedia is back up after a brief, Brexit-inspired sell-off. And cruise lines recently broke out to reach prices not seen since December.The attack in Nice happened late Thursday night as revelers were at a parade celebrating France's Bastille Day. A truck, reportedly filled with weapons and explosives, slammed into the crowd killing at least 84 people and wounding 100 others.The suspected terror attack comes eight months after gunmen opened fire at a Paris nightclub and cafes frequented by tourists.But, like prior attacks, the incident in Nice is unlikely to have long term effects on travel.In an prior interview with IBD, Jack Plunkett, CEO of global market research firm Plunkett Research, said that airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks and the same was true after the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, and the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.

Amazon was well off its Friday intraday high, but still above a 923.82 buy point.Facebook (FB) jumped nearly 2% to a record high after a Needham analyst raised the price target to 165 from 150, saying Facebook is taking market share in the advertising industry faster than initially thought.

68,CCL,"Propelled by the overall market, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds notched a 0.78% gain on average in April. The month's modest gain was far better than the losses of January and February.But it lagged the 1.7% gain by the average U.S. taxable bond fund tracked by Lipper Inc.Going forward, mutual fund managers expect more volatility, and many are looking for stocks with stable earnings growth that can thrive without a tailwind from a robust economy.In the just-completed month, multicap value funds did best among the mutual fund market capitalization and style categories.The key impetus was the Federal Reserve's dovish stance on interest rate hikes.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders In a late March speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank would ""proceed cautiously in adjusting policy"" in 2016. In its April meeting, the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee stuck by Yellen's March outlook and declined again to raise rates.""Economic activity appears to have slowed,"" the FOMC said, adding that household spending had ""moderated.""Those statements told investors that the Fed thinks U.S. economic growth is slower than previously believed. Slower growth and slower rate hikes mean a weaker U.S. dollar.""That helps U.S. exporters, which is good news for many U.S. large-cap stocks,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer of Charles Schwab Investment Management.And a weaker dollar lowers the cost of paying off debt for most emerging markets, making it easier for them buy goods and services from the U.S. and others.Putting it bluntly, the Fed did not want to break a fragile U.S. economy by raising the price of money. ""The more dovish tone by the Fed brought down market volatility and helped support all of the assets that have been hurt in anticipation of Fed rate hikes,"" said Mark Hamilton, chief investment officer for asset allocation at OppenheimerFunds.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance Jittery investors lifted precious metals funds 28.76% in April, best among sectors. Energy funds and natural resources funds, which had lost 41.45% and 20.54% respectively in the two years that ended March 31, were the next-best-performing April sectors, jumping 11.62% and 10.46% last month.World equity funds gained 1.33% in April, led by Latin American funds' 6.59% leap up.Taxable bond funds were paced by high-yield funds' 2.89% advance. With investors willing to take on risk, safe-haven general U.S. Treasury funds slipped 0.33%.""I expect mediocre returns and a fair amount of volatility going forward,"" Hamilton said. When the Fed finally does get around to its next rate hike, volatility is likely to rise, he said.Broadly, he expects the U.S. economy to outperform for several quarters. That should benefit U.S. large caps.James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Funds and manager of $158 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX), expects a reversal of the recent months' rotation into value away from growth.""Materials, energy, industrials and other cyclical sectors are likely to reverse,"" Abate said. ""So we've taken the opportunity to amplify our positions in stable-growth-type companies, Nifty 50 type names. Key stocks for us are names like Amazon (AMZN), PepsiCo (PEP), Exelon (EXC) and Carnival Cruise (CCL). We sold the one energy stock that we held.""Amazon is the epitome of what he's looking for. ""It is strong and has a unique business model that can grow regardless of the economic backdrop,"" he said.Exelon is a utility with low cyclicality, he said. Its current return on equity is about 9%. ""This is roughly half its 15 year median return on equity,"" he said. ""We see incremental ROE moving higher with plenty of room to expand. With the Pepco (acquisition) closing, we see an increased focus on cost-cutting and rate relief in the regulated utility units contributing to profit margin expansion, with a strong balance sheet to allow future dividend hikes and buybacks.""Equally good, the stock is virtually unaffected by economic developments in Japan or Europe, he said.He also likes the idea that Carnival has almost nowhere to go but up from its depressed profit margins and returns on capital.And he adds Merck (MRK), which he calls another low-cyclicality, defensive name. ""It's got a strong drug pipeline,"" he said. ""It's seeing improvements in return on assets. It can be another Nifty 50 name.""Abate has stayed underweight in energy, industrials and financials. ""In materials, our exposure is to companies that are capable of growing and are not dependent on an acceleration in the global economy,"" he said. In that area, his names include Vulcan Materials (VMC) and International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF).Abate says value stocks are unlikely to add a lot to gains they've scored already this year. ""So I'm embracing companies that are more stable and less sensitive to the ups and downs of the economic cycle,"" he said.He also does not rule out a correction of 20% to 25% some time during 2016, and his fund has hedged that possibility with put options.""Profits are disappointing,"" he said. ""Profit margins are decelerating. And there's a poor top-line revenue outlook. It's hard to see price-earnings multiples expand further.""Like Aguilar, Abate expects volatility the rest of this year. The best gains should be confined to a narrow band of stocks, he says. ""With bond yields low and other asset classes disappointing, we'll see a new Nifty 50 do well,"" he said. ""Diversification is good, but over-diversification can be bad. We're down to 52, down from the mid-60s in 2013.""Polaris Capital Management's Bernard Horn, lead or co-manager of five funds totaling $3.4 billion in assets, is concerned about the impact of sluggish economic growth. He used volatility in recent months to buy shares in larger U.S. and foreign banks at depressed prices, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM). ""The valuation became compelling,"" he said.He also added to asset manager Franklin Resources (BEN). ""They have great long-term performance, but have slumped in the last three to five years. We saw an opportunity to buy into a good long-term franchise with a lot of cash on its balance sheet. They have a relatively low tax rate because they have managers who sit offshore, like Mark Mobius,"" who's based in Hong Kong as executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group.Horn also added to Web.com Group (WEB), which creates and maintains websites for small businesses. ""They help small businesses get onto social media sites,"" he said. ""A business they just bought does sophisticated marketing and lead-generation for customers.""Another he added to was electronics and technology distributor Avnet (AVT), a company which also assembles products for customers. ""They've got a good management team that squeezes out free cash flow and value-added services for customers,"" Horn said.In Q1, he added to Thailand-based Siam Commercial Bank. The investment may not ripen quickly, he says. ""The Thai economy is a little soft now, so this may take time to play out,"" he said.

69,CCL,"Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) nearly tripled earnings during the first quarter, prompting the Miami-based company to raise its full-year profit guidance by a similar amount.Excluding items, the cruise operator earned 57 cents a share in Q1, up 185% from a year earlier and 26 cents better than forecasts of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 5.6% to $1.918 billion, roughly in line with views of $1.916 billion, and net yields rose 7% on a constant currency basis.Full-year EPS guidance was raised by 25 cents to a range of $6.15 to $6.35, driven by a more favorable currency environment and strength in North American products and onboard revenue. Analysts expect EPS of $6.09.Shares closed up 1.8% on the stock market today, after rising as much as 4.5% early then turning negative midday.Meanwhile, Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) is scheduled to report Q1 earnings on May 10.

"
70,CCL,"Cruise ship operator stocks gapped higher Wednesday after Carnival (CCL) reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings that nearly doubled as fuel prices remained low and pricing held steady.""All three (major) cruise operators have been doing pretty well,"" said Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz. ""(There's been a) pretty consistent voice across the industry: Nobody wants to bow to discounting right now. All three want to hold firm on pricing.""Carnival shares rose 5.5% to 52.37 on the stock market today, moving past a 50.01 buy point from a cup-with-handle base to a nine-month high. The stock also notched up above its 200-day moving average.Norwegian Cruise Line Holding (NCLH) jumped 5.7% and remains deep inside an area of consolidation that began in October. Royal Caribbean (RCL) leapt 5.65%, giving shares a more definitive boost above the stock's 50-day line. Royal Caribbean plunged over 15% in early February after offering disappointing guidance.Carnival's Q1 per-share profit jumped 95% to 39 cents a share, topping expectations by 7 cents. Revenue grew over 3% to $3.65 billion, slightly above forecasts for $3.63 billion, marking the second straight quarter of earnings and sales acceleration for the cruise ship operator.Gross cruise costs, including fuel, fell 6% during the quarter on changes in fuel costs and currency exchange rates.Carnival said advance bookings for the rest of 2016 are “well ahead of the prior year at slightly higher prices,"" and that since January, booking volumes for the year are ""running ahead of last year's historically high levels at higher prices.""""The risk of having really aggressive discounting come into the picture for them for that big quarter would be much lower than prior to today,"" said Katz, referring to the Q3 peak season, which ends in August. ""We feel like there are a lot of opportunities for the business to grow.""Carnival raised the bottom end of its full-year EPS guidance to $3.20-$3.40, up from a prior outlook for $3.10-$3.40. But the midpoint of the newly updated range still comes in below current expectations for $3.37 a share for the year.It sees Q2 EPS of 34-38 cents vs. views for 38 cents.Certain trends, such as a shift to millennials -- a group that greatly values experiences -- ""bodes very well for travel and leisure companies,"" said Katz, who also highlighted the retiring baby boomer set and an emerging market in China.On March 21, Carnival announced that it had gotten the green light from Cuba to start sailing there, beginning May 1, through its ""impact travel"" brand Fathom. Launched last year, Fathom is part of the new wave of ""voluntourism,"" which allows travelers to sight-see and volunteer at the same time. Its seven-day journeys to Cuba will include a cultural exchange program.Norwegian and Royal Caribbean are said to be expecting to receive approvals in the near future as well.""So far in calendar 2016, pricing trends appear to have remained relatively steady, despite Zika virus headlines and terrorist events in Turkey and Belgium, although the latter may be so recent as to have not yet had any impact on pricing,"" William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia wrote about Carnival on March 23.

The gain hoisted Lululemon stock 6% above a 63.60 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Small-caps and growth stocks generally lagged in Wednesday's early action. Most IBD 50 stocks trended lower, with Store Capital (STOR) and Smith & Wesson Holdings (SWHC) falling around 2%.Store Capital dropped after pricing a 33.3 million-share offering (of shares held by Store Holding Co., a stockholder affiliated with Oaktree Capital Management) at 25.25, almost 3% below Tuesday's closing price.

72,CCL,"United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Priceline (PCLN) and other travel-related stocks dropped Tuesday after terrorist attacks at Brussels' Zaventem airport and a subway station killed more than 30.There weren’t creditable threats to any U.S airport but security was heightened in New York, Washington and other major cities.Some train stations around Brussels reopened late Tuesday but the airport will remain closed until Thursday, as one suspect remains at large. The Islamic State took responsibility for the attacks, which seriously wounded at least three Americans.United said that its flight from Washington Dulles to Brussels deplaned normally at the gate and a second flight from Newark Liberty was rerouted to another location. All remaining flights were canceled.United shares closed down 1.1% in the stock market today, paring back steeper, early losses. American shares fell 1.6%. Travel booking site Priceline lost 2.3%. Cruise lines Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) all sold off 2% or more.Ryanair (RYAAY) canceled all flights to Zaventem, but flights were still operating to Charleroi Airport near Brussels with delays, while Delta Air Lines (DAL) diverted a flight to Amsterdam.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair shares fell 1%. Delta shares dropped 1.5%.Savanthi Syth, a vice president of equity research at Raymond James, said in a note that it was too early to tell the impact the attacks will have on air travel but that the attacks came during peak Easter travel and ahead of summer travel.Syth said Ryanair has the greatest exposure to the Brussels market while United has the largest exposure of U.S. carriers followed by Delta.“While domestic U.S. airlines are not directly exposed, there may be knock-on impacts via code-share partners and potential pressure on domestic pricing from any fall off in connecting demand.”Starwood Hotel (HOT) said all of its hotels in the city were on lockdown. Starwood shares dipped 0.4%.Travel stocks had a similar reaction after the Paris attacks last year. But analysts didn’t expect overall travel demand to take a long-term hit.Airlines were busy again within a few weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the 2002 nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, as well as the transit bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005.Still, the current refugee crisis and ramp-up in the fight against the Islamic State could weigh on travelers’ decisions.

It paid $3 billion for eight small luxury cruise ships as part of its strategy to pursue a higher-end demographic.Two 4,000-passenger vessels for Norwegian — the Getaway and Breakaway — have been big hits with customers.

246,CCL,"Call it the little cruise line that could. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) has built as big or bigger ships than rivals two to four times its size, and with bells and whistles second to none.

"
247,CCL,"Richard Weiss is a key cog in the machinery that outlines how American Century's asset allocation mutual funds play the market in 2015.
"
248,CCL,"He is on the team overseeing the investment strategies for that group of mutual funds.
"
249,CCL,"And he co-manages the firm's nine One Choice target-date funds, its six One Choice target-risk funds, its three Strategic Allocation funds, its Global Allocation Fund and its Multi-Asset Income Fund.
"
250,CCL,"That's $19.6 billion in assets, in addition to his asset-allocation strategy work.
"
251,CCL,"Just before the New Year, IBD asked the 54-year-old El Segundo, Calif.-based Weiss for his thoughts on the best stock investing opportunities in 2015.
"
252,CCL,"IBD: Let's clarify how your fund groups differ from each other, Rich. The One Choice funds whose names include a year, such as $1.5 billion One Choice 2020 Portfolio , are target-date funds, whose mix of stocks and bonds changes as the target date gets near, right?
"
253,CCL,"Weiss: Yes.
"
254,CCL,"IBD: And the One Choice mutual funds whose name includes a description of its investment style are target-risk funds, which some people call lifestyle funds, whose asset mix generally stays the same over time, right?
"
255,CCL,"Weiss: Also correct, with one slight modification. In the target-risk funds, we do make tactical re-allocations from time to time, depending on the intermediate-term outlook.
"
256,CCL,"IBD: And how do the target date and target risk groups differ from the Strategic Allocation funds?
"
257,CCL,"Weiss: The One Choice portfolios are funds of funds. The Strategic Allocation funds invest in individual securities.
"
258,CCL,"IBD: Characterize how all of those portfolios are deployed now, please.
"
259,CCL,"Weiss: In the One Choice and Strategic Allocation portfolios, we have been and remain overweight in equities. At least (in all of 2014).
"
260,CCL,"IBD: How would you describe the stock market's performance in 2014?
"
261,CCL,"Weiss: Without appearing too glib, you can sum up all of 2014 in two letters: U and S. The U.S. dominated, economically and marketwise.
"
262,CCL,"The U.S. showed some of the strongest, if not the strongest, economic growth in 2014 and likely will in 2015 vs. most developed markets and emerging markets.
"
263,CCL,"IBD: What does that tell investors about 2015?
"
264,CCL,"Weiss: We're seeing the bull market get long in the tooth. If you look at sector rotation, the market was led by a handful that are notoriously late-cycle economic sectors. They tend to thrive toward the end of an economic cycle.
"
265,CCL,"IBD: Such as?
"
266,CCL,"Weiss: Utilities, health care, consumer staples. Tech also was strong, but it's a growth sector.
"
267,CCL,"So three of the top four sectors are late-cycle, defensive sectors. Typically, they only lead the market shortly before it turns down.
"
268,CCL,"IBD: Sounds like everyone should dive into the nearest foxhole.
"
269,CCL,"Weiss: We're late (in the) cycle. But the cycle is not over yet.
"
270,CCL,"We remain overweight in equities and in late-cycle growth stocks. We are beginning to diversify and move into more international securities.
"
271,CCL,"U.S. equities outperformed foreign developed markets by about 60 percentage points over the last five years. As a result, U.S. valuations relative to major foreign economies have gotten to historically high levels.
"
272,CCL,"IBD: And what should investors do with that knowledge?
"
273,CCL,"Weiss: I see this as an opportunity to take profits in U.S. equities and diversify into developed foreign markets.
"
274,CCL,"IBD: So which foreign markets appeal to you most?
"
275,CCL,"Weiss: Predominantly in Europe, despite their problems. Even because of their problems.
"
276,CCL,"The valuations metrics are discounting some severe issues in developed markets in the eurozone.
"
277,CCL,"IBD: And which sectors do you prefer?
"
278,CCL,"Weiss: We'd lean to late-cycle growth and utilities. We continue to favor types that did well this year: tech, health care.
"
279,CCL,"Consumer staples are No. 1. We like companies that sell items that consumers need regardless of whether we're headed into a recession or a recovery.
"
280,CCL,"IBD: Do you like some parts of the eurozone better than others?
"
281,CCL,"Weiss: We're staying away from the periphery, where the risks are greatest. We're staying in larger economies — predominantly Germany and France. We also find the U.K. attractive, although it's not formally part of the eurozone.
"
282,CCL,"IBD: Do you like any emerging markets, perhaps some that don't depend on commodity exports?
"
283,CCL,"Weiss: We do have positions in emerging markets in virtually all of our portfolios, but we're not looking to increase those in the near future.
"
284,CCL,"IBD: What about emerging markets that are not big oil exporters?
"
285,CCL,"Weiss: Our stock selection is bottom-up rather than top-down. But we are currently overweight in three countries in our emerging markets funds: China, Peru and Turkey.
"
286,CCL,"IBD: Why is that?
"
287,CCL,"Weiss: We are finding companies in China that benefit from the growth and increasing penetration of modern retail, specifically online retailing.
"
288,CCL,"China also benefits from a loosening of government fiscal policies regarding such things as lending and housing purchases and infrastructure investment.
"
289,CCL,"From an e-tailing perspective, logistics-transportation becomes important too.
"
290,CCL,"We own Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) and Vipshop (VIPS) to name a few that benefit from the above themes.
"
291,CCL,"IBD: What about Peru, please?
"
292,CCL,"WEISS: It's overweight due to one stock: Credicorp (BAP), which is a high-quality, well-managed bank.
"
293,CCL,"It benefits from increasing banking penetration in Peru, as well as a resetting of government policies.
"
294,CCL,"IBD: What do you like in Turkey?
"
295,CCL,"Weiss: We favor Ulker Biskuvi, a chocolate and cookies company; and two transportation stocks — TVA Holdings, an airports' operator, and Pegasus Airlines, a low-cost carrier.
"
296,CCL,"Those stocks benefit from increasing penetration of modern retail and increasing penetration of air travel.
"
297,CCL,"IBD: What are your sector overweights, and why?
"
298,CCL,"Weiss: Our team selects the most attractive stocks around the world. Country and sector weights are a result of that.
"
299,CCL,"In consumer discretionary, (we like) high, visible space growth opportunities like Pandora, the jewelry company, and Inditex (the Spanish fashion retailer, which owns Zara stores).
"
300,CCL,"Airline, hotel and travel companies benefit directly or indirectly from tightening supply-demand, which is helping to drive pricing improvement. (We also like) beneficiaries from lower energy costs — stocks like Whitbread, the U.K. three-star hotel operator; International Airlines Group, which operates British Airways and Iberia airlines; and Carnival (CCL) cruise line.
"
301,CCL,"IBD: Is your team overweight in tech?
"
302,CCL,"Weiss: Yes. In technology (we like) new product cycles such as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6/6+, and the rise of new, lower-cost smartphone original equipment makers focused on growth in emerging markets, like (privately owned handset maker) Xiaomi in China, and chip manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) (TSM), the Taiwan-based foundry company.
"
303,CCL,"The intensifying competition among smartphone and other electronics OEMs is resulting in increasing demand for leading edge semiconductor content. This benefits (Dutch based) ASML Holding (ASML), the largest provider of lithography equipment.
"
304,CCL,"The rising use of e-commerce and the shift to mobile usage is benefiting Alibaba and Japan's Rakuten (which runs the large Ichiba e-commerce site).
"
305,CCL,"The increased use of social media applications, particularly in China, is helping stocks like TenCent.

306,CCL,"And the accelerating trend of advertising dollars shifting from traditional media to digital benefits stocks like Baidu (BIDU), the GoogleGOOGL of China.
"
307,CCL,"IBD: What other sectors?
"
308,CCL,"Weiss: In health care, more efficient spending on R&D, combined with benefits of mapping the human genome, is resulting in accelerating new product launches, driving improved revenue growth for the pharmaceuticals industry.

310,CCL,"Cruising waters are about to get a little more crowded as a new, high-profile cruise line plans to horn in on established Miami-based operators Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH).Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson announced Thursday that his company, with backer Bain Capital, plans to ""shake up the cruise industry"" with the start of Virgin Cruises, to be based out of the Miami/Fort Lauderdale area.Two new cruise ships are planned initially to serve cruise guests who ""deserve something better and different,"" stated Tom McAlpin, who will lead Virgin Cruises as its CEO. He formerly was president of Disney Cruise Line and most recently CEO of The World, Residences at Sea.Should Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian be worried? If they are, they have around three years to strategize over Virgin's move into their turf.That's about how long it would take for a new ship to be delivered, noted Robin Farley, an analyst with UBS.Despite obvious concerns about a new entrant's impact on the cruise market, especially in the crowded Caribbean, Farley says Virgin's entry might actually be a positive. It would attract more attention to the cruise market — and more passengers for everyone, she noted.She pointed out that Disney's entrance into the cruise market years ago was a concern but ended up as ""a big positive for the industry"" because it raised awareness of cruising as a vacation option. That was especially true for first-timers, who were likely to become repeat customers, often on other cruise lines.After first-timers try Virgin, they might want to try a different itinerary next time around — ""which means going to a different brand,"" Farley wrote in a research note Thursday.""While Virgin is not the powerhouse vacation brand that Disney is, we still believe it would attract more attention to the cruise market than the capacity it will represent,"" she said.Carnival, the biggest, is finally on smoother waters after three straight years of falling profit; earnings are expected to grow 19% this year. Norwegian and Royal Caribbean have been doing better. All three stocks have been steaming ahead since mid-October.IBD rates the stock of Norwegian, the smallest cruise operator of the three, the highest, with a Composite Rating of 97 out of 99, based on stock price, earnings and other metrics.

313,CCL,"Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is in buying range after cruise stocks shook off an Ebola scare last month. It's now setting its sights on China.Royal Caribbean is just past a 69.41 buy point of a V-shaped cup base that it cleared earlier this month. The base is a riskier late-stage pattern that began forming in September, after the stock had tripled from a June 2012 low.The left side of the pattern shows a sharp decline coinciding with the spread of Ebola. In mid-October, a lab worker who may have had contact with the Ebola virus was quarantined after boarding a Carnival (CCL) cruise shipRoyal Caribbean has a Composite Rating of 85, sixth best in the 30-stock Leisure-Services industry, which has slipped 30 places to 60th out of 197 as of Thursday's IBD. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) leads the group with a 97 rating.Nevertheless, Royal Caribbean appears poised to benefit as a wealthy baby boomer generation enters retirement and China's middle class ventures abroad in growing numbers.UBS analyst Robin Farley said recently that China could be the next ""major force in cruising"" and that Royal Caribbean is angling for a big piece of the actionRoyal Caribbean's profit growth has been choppy, with a 40% decline in Q1 profit sandwiched in between two periods of triple-digit increases.Profit for the current quarter is seen rising 87% to 43 cents a share. Sales are expected to increase 2% to $1.9 billion, continuing a long string of mostly single-digit gains.Royal Caribbean's breakout came in below-average volume, a bearish sign. But the stock's B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating indicates positive demand for the shares.Institutional investors have increased their holdings for four straight quarters. The A+-rated PRIMECAP Odyssey Aggressive Growth Fund has held the stock for 10 straight quarters.

314,CCL,"Cruise liner stocks dipped slightly in premarket trading after news that a Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital lab supervisor who may have had contact with Ebola specimens from the first U.S. case of the disease is currently aboard a Carnival (CCL) cruise ship.Shares of Carnival have since recovered, up 1.3% to 35.15, while shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), which reports Oct. 23, rose 2% to 57.46. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) shares rose 1.6% to 31.79 in the stock market today.While the unnamed woman has not shown any symptoms of Ebola and did not come into direct contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian national who died at Texas Health Presbyterian last week after contracting the virus, she has been placed in isolation on the ship. The ship is on a weeklong journey through the Caribbean from Galveston, Texas and is due to return Sunday.The CDC informed Carnival on Wednesday that the health worker was on one of its ships. The CDC's updated active-monitoring requirements were announced after she had already left the country, though she has reportedly been self-monitoring since Oct. 6.So far, two health care workers who treated Duncan have been diagnosed with Ebola.Airline stocks had dipped mid-week after it was revealed that the second person to be diagnosed had taken a Frontier Airlines flight from Cleveland to Dallas a day before the diagnosis.RELATED:Hazmat Suit Makers Up, Airlines Fall As Ebola Spreads.

326,CCL,"Forget slow boats to China. The nation could be the next ""major force in cruising"" as new ships from more mature cruising regions head to China to tap into its growing middle-class family-vacation market, said UBS analyst Robin Farley in a research report Thursday.
"
327,CCL,"In addition to satisfying new demand, redeployed ships from North America and Europe could help ease pricing pressures in mature cruise markets such as the Caribbean, she said.
"
328,CCL,"All cruise operators benefit from less capacity in mature markets. But those with the scale to deploy ships to China benefit the most, she wrote, namely Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), both based in Miami.
"
329,CCL,"Royal Caribbean plans to deploy its newest ship, the Quantum of the Seas, to Shanghai year-round starting in May-June, after just six months of initial New York-Caribbean voyages.
"
330,CCL,"China could become a major cruising market just as it has become a major market for the lodging industry, Farley noted. For example, China is the biggest market outside the U.S. for both Marriott (MAR) and Starwood Hotels (HOT), she noted.
"
331,CCL,"Royal Caribbean is the best positioned in the China cruise market, Farley says, due in part to new business ties with Chinese online travel company Ctrip (CTRP), the biggest seller of cruises in China.
"
332,CCL,"Royal Caribbean recently struck a deal with Ctrip for the sale of one its older ships. Under a joint venture, Royal Caribbean will manage the renovated vessel. Ctrip has been Royal's largest cruise agency in China for the last couple of years.
"
333,CCL,"Partnering with Ctrip is a ""pretty good way to learn what the Chinese consumer wants and how to reach them,"" Farley said.
"
334,CCL,"That knowledge will be especially helpful when the 4,180-berth Quantum of the Seas begins service out of Shanghai next year.
"
335,CCL,"Since Royal Caribbean's newest ship has ""cutting-edge amenities"" and would usually ""command the highest price in the Caribbean,"" why put it in China?, Farley asked. Her answer: it'll have ""a first mover advantage in a market that is just learning about the cruise sector and its brands.""
"
336,CCL,"Carnival's Costa brand actually entered China as early as 2006, Farley noted, but with much smaller ships than the Quantum. And the Quantum will sail year-round in China rather than seasonally.
"

338,CCL,"Sending the Quantum to China full-time ""has execution risk,"" given its large size in a new market — ""a bigger ship to fill than anything that market has seen,"" Farley noted. But the nearly $1 billion investment ""can be floated back to North America if China isn't ready for it yet.""Forget slow boats to China. The nation could be the next ""major force in cruising"" as new ships from more mature cruising regions head to China to tap into its growing middle-class family-vacation market, said UBS analyst Robin Farley in a research report Thursday.In addition to satisfying new demand, redeployed ships from North America and Europe could help ease pricing pressures in mature cruise markets such as the Caribbean, she said.All cruise operators benefit from less capacity in mature markets. But those with the scale to deploy ships to China benefit the most, she wrote, namely Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), both based in Miami.Royal Caribbean plans to deploy its newest ship, the Quantum of the Seas, to Shanghai year-round starting in May-June, after just six months of initial New York-Caribbean voyages.China could become a major cruising market just as it has become a major market for the lodging industry, Farley noted. For example, China is the biggest market outside the U.S. for both Marriott (MAR) and Starwood Hotels (HOT), she noted.Royal Caribbean is the best positioned in the China cruise market, Farley says, due in part to new business ties with Chinese online travel company Ctrip (CTRP), the biggest seller of cruises in China.Royal Caribbean recently struck a deal with Ctrip for the sale of one its older ships. Under a joint venture, Royal Caribbean will manage the renovated vessel. Ctrip has been Royal's largest cruise agency in China for the last couple of years.Partnering with Ctrip is a ""pretty good way to learn what the Chinese consumer wants and how to reach them,"" Farley said.That knowledge will be especially helpful when the 4,180-berth Quantum of the Seas begins service out of Shanghai next year.Since Royal Caribbean's newest ship has ""cutting-edge amenities"" and would usually ""command the highest price in the Caribbean,"" why put it in China?, Farley asked. Her answer: it'll have ""a first mover advantage in a market that is just learning about the cruise sector and its brands.""Carnival's Costa brand actually entered China as early as 2006, Farley noted, but with much smaller ships than the Quantum. And the Quantum will sail year-round in China rather than seasonally.Next year, Carnival plans to move its fourth ship to China, the 2,928-berth Costa Serena, which sails in the Mediterranean.Sending the Quantum to China full-time ""has execution risk,"" given its large size in a new market — ""a bigger ship to fill than anything that market has seen,"" Farley noted.

343,CCL,"Michael Kors (KORS) dethroned Coach in recent years as the it handbag, but how is it faring against upstart Kate Spade in the battle for affordable luxury purses and clutches?Last year Kors posted a 72% jump in shares as sales rose $2.2 billion. Kors is slated to report fourth-quarter results May 28. Analysts expect the fashion house to report a 36% jump in earnings to 68 cents per share and sales to rise 37% to $816.7 million.Over the holidays, Kors increased its market share among 18-24-year-old women. According to a Cowen Consumer Tracking Survey, among women 18 to 34 years old, 30% preferred Michael Kors to Coach (COH) in December 2013, up from 24% in November 2013 and 20% in December 2012. For women who buy two to three handbags per year, the preference for Michael Kors hit a new high of 27% in December 2013 vs. 23% in November and 16% in December 2012.Kors handbags tend to sell for $200-$350, a pricey item but less so than an even more upscale Louis Vuitton bag.Kors' stock debut on the NYSE in December 2011, but Michael Kors the designer has been turning heads on runways around the world since 1981 when he launched the Michael Kors women's wear line.Kors is a more mature brand than Kate Spade (KATE) and, like Coach, has learned, older, established brands that don't always do better.In a report last month, Citi said Kors has four times the share of the global handbag market vs. Kate.But as with Kors' leap over Coach, Kate could be the next big thing, say analysts in the Citi report.Last week, Kate reported an adjusted loss from continuing operations of 6 cents per share, up from a loss of 16 cents in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting only a 4-cent loss. But sales jumped 33.5% to $328 million, its best gain in several years, on a 54% jump in its namesake Kate Spade brand as the company sheds its underperforming brands like Juicy Couture and Lucky Brand.Kate is known for its handbags with bright colors and bold stripes. The brand also makes home accessories, an area Coach and Kors don't have a large presence in.The brutal winter and tough economic conditions for consumers hit retailers overall, but luxury brands still seemed to do well during the holidays as shoppers splurged on the it bag of the season.It's debatable if the it bag was Kors or Kate, but it definitely wasn't Coach. In April, Coach reported a 19% drop in Q3 EPS to 68 cents while revenue fell 7.4% to $1.1 billion, and its North American same-store sales fell 21% on weakness in women's bags and accessories.Still, the story isn't over quite yet for Coach. The company is under the direction of a new management team and creative director as it looks to remake itself from something old into something new.Michael Kors shares edged higher in the stock market today.

Moreover the stock has declined 9.9% in a month against the industry’s 3.8% rise. What Caused the DownfallNorwegian Cruise stock decreased yesterday, primarily due to its competitor Carnival Corporation’s (CCL  -  Free Report) announcement of a dismal forecast. The company’s trimmed full-year earnings outlook (mainly due to rising fuel costs and currency-related headwinds) also induced a drop in the share price of another rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report).It is important to note that the cruise industry has been grappling with unfavorable demand-supply conditions and Norwegian Cruise is no exception. Per CNBC reports, high industry supply, slackening yield growth and weakness in the Caribbean and China are causes for concern in the industry.Rising fuel prices are another headwind for the company as well as the entire industry. With fuel prices shooting up, such costs are anticipated to hurt the company’s bottom line in the second quarter of 2018. Notably, high costs have been affecting the company since the past few quarters. Total cruise operating expenses were up 7.5% in 2017.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.95 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.It remains to be seen how the recently released numbers will impact the stock price, and the immediate price movement will reflect how these results and management's commentary on the earnings call help shape expectations for the coming quarter(s).Carnival shares have lost about 4.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3%.What's Next for Carnival?While Carnival has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Carnival was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

393,CCL,"News Corporation (NWSA  -  Free Report), the diversified media conglomerate, is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 10. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether the company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, News Corporation underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16%.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has witnessed a downtrend in the last seven days, and is currently pegged at 8 cents, reflecting a 23.3% decline from the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.11 billion compared with $2.23 billion reported in the prior-year period.News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  News Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | News Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that News Corporation is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.News Corporation has an Earnings ESP of -25.00% as the Most Accurate estimate of 6 cents per share is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. Further, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which combined with a negative ESP erodes chances of a beat.Factors Influencing this QuarterNews Corporation is in a transitionary phase, looking to diversify revenue streams through strategic acquisitions and operational enhancement. The company is expanding digital offerings, along with greater emphasis on real estate businesses.  Further, News Corporation has outperformed the industry in the last one month. The company grew 9.1%, while the industry was up 1.3%.However, foreign currency headwinds and soft print advertising demand continue to weigh upon the  performance.Advertising, which forms a major part of News Corporation’s total revenue (approximately 44% of fiscal 2016 total revenue), remains highly vulnerable to the economic conditions. We believe that the macro-economic factors such as softness in business spending, high unemployment and falling home sales may adversely affect the level of national, retail and classified advertising revenues, as advertisers cut their budget in response to weak economic conditions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Coach Inc.  currently has an ESP of +2.08% and a Zacks Rank #3.

394,CCL,"A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is essential for a better investment decision.Often investors evaluate a company’s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company’s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the role of coverage ratios comes into play — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. And the company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations, and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of “A” or “B” to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which operates as a homebuilding company, has a VGM score of “B” and an expected EPS growth rate of 16.7% for 3–5 years. The stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY  -  Free Report), which owns and operates entertainment and dining venues, has a VGM score of “A” and a Zacks Rank #2.

The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.Time Warner Inc. , which operates as a media and entertainment company, has a VGM score of “B” and an expected EPS growth rate of 9.5% for 3–5 years.

395,CCL,"Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, after the closing bell. Investors are keen to know whether this leading apparel retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. We note that the company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, leading to an average negative surprise of 1.74%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Trending A look at the estimate revision gives us an idea regarding analyst’s expectations before the company releases its earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the second quarter and the fiscal 2017 have remained stable over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents in the said quarter reflects a year-over-year growth of 3.4% and is also within the management’s guided range of 51–54 cents of adjusted earnings. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.97 for fiscal 2017 reflects year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.65 billion for the quarter under review, an increase of 11.7% from the year-ago period.  The same for fiscal 2017 is pegged at $6.5 billion.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hanesbrands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP  Filter.Hanesbrands has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 53 cents. Moreover, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hanesbrands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayHanesbrands has been witnessing lower-than-expected sales for the past few quarters, mainly due to soft sales at its brick-and-mortar stores. In fact, the company’s sales have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 12 of the past 13 quarters. The company projects organic sales for the to-be-reported quarter to decline due to the current retail sales scenario along with a timing shift of back-to-school shipments.Further, the company is witnessing headwinds such as intense competition in its premium brands, adverse foreign currency translations and sluggish traffic at its stores. Such factors have been pulling down the stocks of the company. Its shares have underperformed the broader Consumer Discretionary sector over the past one year.  In the said time frame, Hanesbrands’ shares have declined 10.3% while the sector depicted  growth of 16.9%. Although the company’s recently launched Project Booster Program is expected to drive investment for growth and minimize costs, benefits from the same are not anticipated in the near term.Still Interested in Consumer Discretionary Stocks?

397,CCL,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) posted mixed third-quarter 2017 results wherein earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same. Though strong close-in booking and pricing trends bolstered the quarterly performance, hurricanes had a negative impact on the quarter’s earnings to the tune of 26 cents per share. Meanwhile, solid demand trends and continued cost discipline led the company to successfully complete its Double-Double program. Further, Royal Caribbean its new three-year program designed to drive performance: 20/20 Vision. Adjusted earnings of $3.49 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.43 by 1.8%. The reported figure was also above management’s projected figure of $3.45 per share. Further, earnings increased 9.1% from the year-ago tally of $3.20 on the back of slightly higher revenues and lower fuel costs. Total revenues increased 0.2% year over year to $2.57 billion, driven by higher onboard and other revenues. However, the same slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.58 billion. Per management, the hurricanes had a negative impact on quarterly revenues. Quarter Highlights On a constant currency basis, net yields increased 5.3% year over year better than the guided range of 4-4.5%. The outperformance came on the back of strong booking and pricing trends on China, Europe and North American itineraries. While passenger ticket revenues decreased 0.4% to $1.89 billion, onboard and other revenues increased 1.9% to $676.4 million. Net cruise costs (NCC), excluding fuel, increased 5.7% on a constant currency basis, more than management’s expectation of a 4% increase. Notably, the rise in the costs was mainly owing to reduced capacity due to hurricanes.Excluding the impact of the same, absolute costs for the quarter were lower than expected because of timing. Total cruise operating expenses decreased 1.6% year over year to nearly $1.32 billion, mainly due to a decline in onboard and other expenses, lower fuel, payroll and related as well as other operating costs. This was partly offset by increased food expenses as well as higher commissions, transportation and other costs. 4Q17 Guidance For the fourth quarter, Royal Caribbean expects adjusted earnings per share to come in the range of $1.15 to $1.20.

398,CCL,"Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second quarter of fiscal 2018 results on Jun 25, before the opening bell.The company’s overall top line is likely to witness an uptick in the second quarter, given robust performance across Passenger Tickets business, and Onboard and Other segments. Higher revenues and revenue yields are likely to boost earnings as well.Notably, shares of Carnival have lost 5.2% in the past year against the industry’s growth of 2.8%.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that might have shaped up the company’s second-quarter results.Top Line to Gain From Higher Segmental RevenuesCarnival generates revenues from Passenger Tickets business, Onboard and Other, as well as Tour and Other segments. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter total revenues is pegged at $4.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 9.8% from the year-ago quarter.Also, in the last reported quarter, the company’s top line grew 11.6% year over year, reflecting sales strength across all segments. The upside trend is likely to have continued in the second quarter as well.Passenger Tickets revenues are expected to increase year over year, driven by price improvements in Carnival’s European, Caribbean and Alaska programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $3.2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.1%. In the first quarter, passenger tickets revenues improved 8.3% year over year.Onboard and Other revenues will carry on the momentum of the first quarter (up 7.3% year over year) and are anticipated to further improve in the quarter to be reported. Higher onboard spending by guests and capacity rise in available lower berth days (ALBD) are expected to drive the growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 9.3%.Tour and Other revenues are expected to increase, given robust booking trends. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $43.2 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 16.8%.Meanwhile, per the consensus estimate, net revenue yield is likely to improve 8.1% year over year in the second quarter, following the 3.9% increase in the last reported quarter. The upside trend is attributed to higher net ticket, and net on-board and other yields. The company however expects net revenue yield to improve in the band of 2.5-3.5% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.Top Line to Drive EPS Even though the company anticipates net cruise costs to increase in the range of 4-5% from the prior-year quarter, adjusted earnings per share is still expected within 56-60 cents. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 60 cents for the to-be-reported quarter, mirroring 15.4% year-over-year growth. The improvement is expected to be driven primarily by higher revenues and an increase in net ticket, and on-board and other yields.Our Model Doesn’t Suggest a BeatAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) stocks are best avoided, especially if they have a negative Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Carnival has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.80%, a combination that does not suggest an earnings beat.Carnival Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Carnival Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Carnival Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some leisure stocks that according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their respective quarters to be reported.Live Nation Entertainment (LYV  -  Free Report), Norwegian Cruise (NCLH  -  Free Report) and Cinemark (CNK  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #3, have Earnings ESP of +25.58%, +0.36% and +1.88%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

399,CCL,"Rising demand for cruise travel, the addition of new ships to its fleet and solid booking trends bode well for Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report). Also, the company delivered better-than-expected earnings for the tenth successive quarter, when it reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.However, shares of Carnival witnessed a sharp decline following the quarterly results. This downturn can be attributed to the company’s trimmed earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. The stock has also underperformed the industry in a year’s time. While Carnival has declined 10%, the industry increased 0.1%. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystsCarnival is the historically the most profitable cruise operator in the world. Its cruise brands are well diversified across diverse geographies, including Asia and Europe, and strategically positioned at various price points within the larger North American cruise market. This enables the company to cater to passengers in various geographic regions as well as within the contemporary, premium and luxury cruise segments.Moreover, the company continues to introduce flagships to create demand. In June 2017, its Germany-based AIDA Cruises brand launched AIDAperla — one of the world's most eco-friendly and technologically advanced ships. Carnival also launched Majestic Princess from Princess Cruises in March, which is the world's first cruise ship built specifically for the Chinese market. This cruise ship has been very well received by its guests.During the second quarter of 2018, the company launched Carnival Horizon (belonging to Carnival Cruise Line brand) and Seabourn Ovation (Seabourn). Further, AIDAnova (AIDA Cruises) and ms Nieuw Statendam (Holland America Line) are slated for a December launch. Notably, Carnival has 18 new ships scheduled to be included in its portfolio of leading global cruise brands between 2018 and 2022.Meanwhile, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company believes that it is well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength in bookings particularly in Caribbean, Alaska, Europe, Asia and Australia along with pricing trends for 2018. In fact, management noted that booking trends for third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 have been better than the last year at basically higher prices. Also, cumulative bookings for 2018 are still well ahead of the prior-year’s figure on both press and occupancy at this point in time. As a result, Carnival expects revenue yields (in constant dollars) to continue improving in fiscal 2018 driven by marketing initiatives and a better booking environment. ConcernsCarnival lowered fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance to the band of $4.15-$4.25 from the previously guided range of $4.20-$4.40 due to higher fuel costs. During the second quarter, net cruise costs (in constant dollar) per available lower berth day (ALBD), excluding fuel, increased 3.6% and were better than the March guided range of 4-5% rise. Gross cruise costs (including fuel) per ALBD in current dollars improved 8.8% as well.Negative currency translation also remains an added concern for Carnival. With a major portion of its revenues coming from Asia and Europe, the company is highly exposed to the impact of negative currency translation. Thus, continual strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of the company’s foreign operations is likely to adversely impact its results.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the leisure space include Lindblad Expeditions (LIND  -  Free Report), Town Sports International Holdings, Inc.

Also, Norwegian Cruise Line’ssecond-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. The bottom line improved substantially on a year-over-year basis.Revenues came in at $1,344 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,309 million. Also, the top line increased 13.2% from the year-ago figure.However, this Miami-based company is likely to face turbulence in the quarter. Evidently, multiple headwinds including the back-to-back hurricanes have hurt travel-focused stocks including cruise line companies. In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings has moved down 2.7% over the last 90 days.Also, the stock has struggled of late underperforming the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry over the last six months. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line have declined 0.2%, as against the industry’s rally of 4.9%.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Norwegian Cruise Line’s third-quarter results.Norwegian Cruise Line like its fellow cruise line operators — Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL  -  Free Report) and Carnival Corp (CCL  -  Free Report) — had to call off voyages and re-route ships to avoid stops at islands affected by the hurricanes. In fact, hurricane Irma forced Norwegian Cruise Line to bring back two of its Miami-based ships. The cancellations/ rerouting are likely to adversely impact the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite the headwinds, the company is expected to benefit from robust marketing initiatives and impressive booking environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter passenger ticket revenues is pegged at $1,188 million, higher than $938 million reported in the second quarter of 2017.Notably, Norwegian Cruise Line was recently included in the S&P 500 Index. It expects earnings per share (excluding special items) of approximately $1.83 in the third quarter of 2017. Fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, is projected at $455. Also, we expect the companyto provide a subdued fourth-quarter guidance due to hurricanes.What Does Our Model SayOur proven model does not show conclusively that Norwegian Cruise Linewill beat earnings in the third quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks Rank: Norwegian Cruise Line carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Norwegian Cruise Line has an Earnings ESP of -1.02% as the Most Accurate estimate of 2 cents is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.82 per share. The negative Earnings ESP combined with the Zacks Rank leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive.

401,CCL,"The Q3 earning season is in its tail end and the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector has grabbed attention.Per the latest Earnings Preview, revenues are expected to rise 2.8% in Q3. However, the sector’s earnings are projected to record a decline of 1.2%.Leisure Stocks in FocusThe performance of the leisure companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been impressive so far this earnings season. Notably, leisure stocks mostly perform well during spring and summer.  Among the leisure stocks that have already reported, Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report), Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report), Polaris Industries Inc. (PII  -  Free Report) and International Speedway Corporation (ISCA  -  Free Report) have delivered strong results, with their bottom and top lines outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Let’s take a look at two key leisure stocks that are set to report their third-quarter results on Nov 7. Will these companies manage to put up a decent performance?Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) came up with a positive earnings surprise of 10.78% last quarter. In fact, the company’s earnings have been surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate consistently in the last 14 quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.33% in the trailing four.Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise  Marriott International Price and EPS Surprise | Marriott International QuoteOur proven model also shows that an earnings beat is likely for Marriott this time around. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Given Marriott’s increased scale and distribution post Starwood purchase, its top line is likely get a boost in the to-be-reported quarter. This, in turn, is expected to drive the bottom line and aid in keeping the earnings streak alive. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 98 cents and nearly $5 billion, respectively.Moreover, the company has been witnessing increased revenue per available room (RevPAR) in most markets around the world over the last few quarters. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter as well. However, lingering global uncertainties, competition in domestic market along with negative currency translation might somewhat dent results (read more: Can Marriott Keep its Earnings Streak Alive in Q3?).Global cruise vacation company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.40% in the previous quarter. Also, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.52%.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. QuoteThis Zacks Rank #3 company has an Earnings ESP of -1.10%, which makes surprise prediction difficult in this quarter.Yet, strong booking and demand trends along with various profit-generating initiatives (particularly its Double-Double program) are expected to drive the quarter’s top and bottom-line performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the third quarter is pegged at $3.43, reflecting an increase of 7.1% over the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the quarter’s revenues are anticipated to improve 0.5% year over year to $2.58 billion.Meanwhile, higher-than-anticipated load factors, timing and investment in revenue-generating activities are adding to the company’s costs. Net cruise costs (NCC), excluding fuel, are also likely to be up about 4% to 4.5%. This increase in the cost metric primarily implies a year-over-year capacity reduction. The consensus estimate for the same also reflects a rise of 4% (read more: What to Expect From Royal Caribbean in Q3 Earnings?).Stay tuned!

402,CCL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Carnival Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.0, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.1. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Carnival Corporation’s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 19.3) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Carnival Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Carnival Corporation’s stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Carnival Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 2.5. This is noticeably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Carnival Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CCL a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Carnival Corporation is just 1.0, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.3, which is slightly better than the industry average of 9.6. Clearly, CCL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Carnival Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F. This gives CCL a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days, compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen three upward and two downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen 1.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dipped 0.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Carnival Corporation Price and Consensus  Carnival Corporation Price and Consensus | Carnival Corporation QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCarnival Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a good industry rank (top 41% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

403,CCL,"Per the 2018 outlook by Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the cruise industry is steadily treading on a growth trajectory, with 27.2 million passengers expected to set sail in 2018. In 2017, approximately 25.8 million passengers cruised compared with 24.7 million in 2016. The upside in demand for cruises is largely backed by a favorable economy, exhibiting increased consumer demand for goods and services.According to the Fed’s latest forecast, the economy will grow at a reasonable rate of 2.7% in 2018. Moreover, high real disposable income and low inflation are resulting in higher purchasing behavior. Additionally, a strong economy and increased consumer confidence have driven demand for both leisure and business travel.In line with the industry’s growth, leading U.S. cruise companies — Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) — are trying out different strategies to rake in profits. The companies are also leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the profitable opportunities that the current industry holds.With both the companies carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let’s find out which one is placed better with respect to other parameters.Price Performance and ValuationWhile the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services Industry has grown 1.1% so far this year, Royal Caribbean has lost 1.1%. Carnival’s gain of 1.4% has surpassed the industry.Meanwhile, a look at the EV/EBIT ratio shows that the valuation of the companies looks stretched. The most suitable ratio to evaluate these cruise lines is EV/EBIT. This ratio is also preferred over EBITDA because of the wide difference in the companies’ asset financing patterns.For the industry as a whole, the EV/EBIT ratio stands at 12.43, slightly undervalued than the S&P 500’s value of 15x. The cruise lines are overvalued compared with the broader industry. However, here Carnival has an edge with a lower EV/EBIT value of 14.1 compared with Royal Caribbean’s figure of 18.2x.Earnings History and Projected GrowthBoth Royal Caribbean and Carnival have beaten earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters. While Royal Caribbean has an average positive earnings surprise of 7.34%, Carnival’s average is 15.42%. For the current year, Royal Caribbean’s earnings are expected to grow 17.9%, higher than Carnival’s projected EPS growth of 14.9%.Debt Ratio Since the sector has high financial leverage, the debt-to-asset ratio comes into the picture. This measures the ability of a company to service long-term debt. Hospitality stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios, implying a higher proportion of the company’s assets over the long term. Here, Carnival is at an advantage with a debt ratio of 23.1% compared with Royal Caribbean’s 36.8%. The industry average for the same is 28.3%.Net MarginTraditionally, gross margin for the cruise companies is comparatively higher, as majority of the expenses comes from the cost of operations and not cost of goods sold. However, the sector’s profits are not very high, which is best captured by net profit margin or net margin.The industry’s trailing 12-month net margin is 10.3, while that of Carnival and Royal Caribbean is 14.7% and 18.5%, respectively. It is to be noted that Royal Caribbean’s profit-driving initiatives have helped it in driving margins higher than Carnival.Our TakeOur comparative analysis shows that although Carnival has an edge over Royal Caribbean in terms of share price appreciation and valuation, the higher projected EPS growth puts Royal Caribbean in the lead. Also, in terms of margins, Royal Caribbean has clearly outperformed Carnival.Stocks to ConsiderTwo better-ranked stocks in the industry are Lindblad Expeditions (LIND  -  Free Report) and Six Flags Entertainment (SIX  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.While Lindblad Expeditions’ current year earnings are expected to grow 155.6%, Six Flags Entertainment’s 2018 EPS is projected to improve 33.8%.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

405,CCL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Carnival Tops Q3 Earnings & Revenues, Ups FY17 GuidanceCarnival reported its third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In fact, this Miami-based cruise company’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.29 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20 by 4.1% and surpassed the guided range of $2.16 to $2.20. The bottom line also increased 19.3% year over year. It is to be noted that the company’s quarterly earnings exclude net unrealized losses on fuel derivatives. Total revenue increased about 8% year over year to $5.5 billion on the back of Carnival’s efforts to drive demand. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.4 billion. Net revenue yields (in constant currency) increased 5.1% year over year, higher than the roughly 4% growth projected in June. Meanwhile, gross revenue yields increased 5.5%.Segment RevenuesCarnival earns revenues from its Passenger Tickets business, Onboard and Other as well as Tour and Other segments. Passenger Tickets: Passenger Tickets revenues increased 8.8% year over year to $4.14 billion. Onboard and Other: Onboard and Other revenues were $1.22 billion, up 6.7% year over year. Tour and Other: Revenues from this segment increased 4.1% year over year to $154 million. Expenses Net cruise costs (in constant dollar) per available lower berth day (ALBD), excluding fuel and impairments, inched up 0.2%, almost in line with the June guidance of approximately flat. Also, gross cruise costs (including fuel) per ALBD in current dollars, increased 12.4%. Fourth-Quarter Fiscal 2017 View Fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 net revenue yields in constant dollars are expected to increase in the band of 1.5-2.5% year over year. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, are anticipated to rise in the range of 6-7% from the prior year figure, on a constant dollar basis. Based on the above factors, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 44 to 50 cents. Disruptions related to the series of storms are likely to reduce EPS by 10-12 cents in the fiscal fourth quarter. Fiscal 2017 Guidance The company anticipates fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.64 to $3.70 (previous projection was in the range of $3.60 to $3.70). Based on current booking trends, the company expects fiscal 2017 net revenue yields in constant currency to be up approximately 4% (higher than previous expectation of 3.5%). Also, the company continues to expect net cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, on a constant currency basis for fiscal 2017, to be up nearly 2.5% (higher than previous expectation of 1.5%). Management noted that cumulative advance bookings for the first half of next year are well ahead of the year-ago level at significantly higher prices.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to four lower. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 20.2% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Carnival's stock has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.

406,CCL,"Shares of swimming pool and lifestyle product maker, Pool Corporation (POOL  -  Free Report) were up over 5% in yesterday’s trading session, after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results.Quarter DiscussionPool’s third-quarter earnings of $1.16 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 by 1.8%.

Continued increases in swimming pool repair and remodel activities including major pool refurbishment and replacement of key pool equipment, led to the improvement in sales. As a result, sales outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $728 million by over 2%.The recent weather events negatively impacted the quarter’s earnings and sales by roughly 2 cents and $4 million, respectively.Behind the Headline NumbersPool reports operations under two segments, the Base Business segment (constituting majority portion of the business) and the Excluded segment (sale centers excluded from base business).The Base business segment witnessed sales growth of 6% year over year, given the resiliency and favorable characteristics inherent to its business and consistent market share gains.Gross profit increased 9% year over year to a record of $216.6 million, with base business gross profit increasing 7%.

407,CCL,"Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 7.9%. Extended Stay surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, the average being a positive 14.2%.Let’s discuss the factors that will likely influence the company’s fourth-quarter results:The transformational initiatives undertaken by the company are expected to continue driving RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) as hotels that have been renovated are witnessing increased Average Daily Rate (ADR) and occupancy levels. For the fourth quarter, the company expects comparable RevPAR growth between 0% and 2%.Additionally, various sales and marketing initiatives, and limited exposure to inbound international travel are likely to drive the top line. Also, franchise sales in the quarter might add to revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $301.06 million, implying a 1.8% decline. However, we note that the company’s lack of exposure to emerging markets might limit its revenue growth potential. That said, the same also limits its exposure to volatile oil markets and unfavorable currency impact, which may boost results.The company’s expense containment and cost-saving measures have been supporting margins. In the first nine months of 2017, operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 55.7%. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, the company incurred approximately $0.3 million in expenses in the prior quarter owing to the post-hurricane maintenance efforts. The company anticipates to incur the same amount in the fourth quarter mainly for landscaping.The company expects adjusted EBITDA between $127 million and $132 million in the fourth quarter, lower than the prior-year quarter. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at 17 cents, implying 15% a year-over-year decline.Quantitative Model PredictionOur quantitative model shows that Extended Stay America does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — that are needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: Extended Stay America has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Extended Stay America carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Extended Stay America, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Extended Stay America, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Extended Stay America, Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the Consumer Discretionary sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and a Zacks Rank #3.

408,CCL,"On Oct 18, we issued an updated research report on cruise and vacation company Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report).Last month, the company posted better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, Carnival anticipates fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.64 to $3.70 (previous projection was in the range of $3.60 to $3.70).In fact, the company continues to reflect strength in several areas and is thus expected to continue performing well in the quarters ahead.Key Growth DriversOf late, Carnival has been continually introducing new flagships to formulate measured capacity growth over time. This also allows its global fleet to meet escalating demand for cruise vacations in every region of the world. In fact, the company currently has 18 new ships planned to be delivered between 2018 and 2022.We note that the launch of new ships is also a part of the company’s long-term strategy to build state-of-the-art vessels that aid in providing guests with a remarkable vacation experience at an exceptional value. Given burgeoning demand for cruise travel, the addition of ships to its fleet bodes well.Meanwhile, Carnival continues to drive revenue yield growth by creating demand in excess of measured capacity growth through its ongoing guest experience, marketing and public relations effort.The company is particularly positive on its recent innovations like the transformational new ocean experience platform, featuring Ocean Medallion, a guest experience platform; PlayOcean, a proprietary mobile gaming portfolio and OceanView, a proprietary digital streaming network. These new offerings are anticipated to accelerate and expand engagement and step up the company’s already high guest experience delivery by leveraging its industry-leading scale.Carnival also believes that it is well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength in its bookings. In fact, management noted that cumulative bookings for the first half of 2018 are still well ahead of the prior year at higher prices, at this point in time. It thus expects revenue yields (in constant dollars) to continue improving in fiscal 2018 backed by marketing initiatives and a better booking environment.Markedly, Carnival has adopted a strategy to grow beyond its familiar itineraries and capitalize on new markets. The Asian source market for cruises is expected to continue growing significantly as it becomes more consumer-driven. Going forward, the company expects to continue profitably growing its presence in China and throughout Asia. Carnival is especially optimistic about growth prospects of the Japanese and Australian markets.  In the meantime, the company continues to lookout for sailing to new destinations in order to drive demand for cruising. Already, Carnival had sailed to markets like Cuba, Mexico and Bermuda in fiscal 2016, where demand is expected to ramp up and boost revenues, significantly.Bottom LineDoes this mean that the company has been lying on a bed of roses? Well, not really!Continual strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of the company’s foreign operations is likely to adversely impact the company’s results. Moreover, an increase in fuel prices may further prove detrimental to the company’s earnings growth.Lingering global uncertainties in certain international markets has also been keeping growth at check. Meanwhile, increased investments in advertising, TV programming and other revenue generating opportunities might put pressure on near-term margins and earnings.In addition, the company faces competition from other cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report).However, notwithstanding the headwinds, Carnival is well poised for growth given its global leader position in the cruise industry and an expected increase in demand for cruise travel, going forward.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

409,CCL,"Premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017) results on Aug 24, before the market opens.In the trailing four quarters, the company has delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 0.79%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to PlayIn the last three months, Hormel Foods’ shares lost 3.6%, as against 7.9% gain incurred by the industry.Fall in turkey prices, extensive competition and increase in overall operating expenses have weighed on the Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store business segment’s performance in the preceding two quarters. The company perceives these headwinds to persist and in turn depress the top and bottom-line performance even in the second half of the fiscal year.Moreover, other adverse headwinds such as a stronger U.S. currency, price inflation of major inputs (such as beef, pork and poultry) or outbreak of any livestock disease are likely to weigh over its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarters.However, amid the aforementioned negativities, Hormel Foods is poised to boost its near-term revenues on the back of stronger demand for popular brands like Skippy and Justin's. Moreover, the company’s ongoing $190 million capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2017 is likely to generate benefits moving ahead.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hormel Foods is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Hormel Foods currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock of 37 cents per share is in line with the Most Accurate estimate.Hormel Foods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Hormel Foods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Hormel Foods Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Hormel Foods’ unfavorable Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), when combined with a 0.00% ESP; makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Key PicksHere are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.

410,CCL,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) posted solid second-quarter 2017 results with both earnings and revenues topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong close-in demand for cruise bolstered the quarterly performance.In fact, solid demand trends and continued cost discipline, resulted in the highest second-quarter earnings in the company’s history. Royal Caribbean thus remains positioned to witness another record year and achieve its targets under the Double-Double program.Adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share were 2.4% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 as well as above the management’s guided range of $1.60 to $1.65. Further, earnings jumped a significant 56.9% from the year-ago tally of $1.09, owing to higher revenues and lower expenses.Total revenue increased 4.3% year over year to $2.195 billion, driven by higher passenger ticket revenues as well as better onboard spending. However, revenues slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.191 billion.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. QuoteQuarter HighlightsOn a constant currency basis, net yields increased 11.5% year over year, better than the guided range of 10-10.5%. The outperformance came on the back of strong close-in demand, which in turn, drove higher pricing and occupancy.Both passenger ticket revenues as well as onboard and other revenues increased 4.3% to $1.58 billion and $613.9 million, respectively.Net cruise costs (NCC), excluding fuel, decreased 0.9% on a constant currency basis, lower than management’s guidance of a decline of about 2%.Also, total cruise operating expenses decreased 4.1% year over year to nearly $1.26 billion, mainly due to a decline in onboard and other expenses, lower food, fuel, payroll and related as well as other operating costs. The decrease was partly offset by higher commissions, transportation and other costs.3Q17 GuidanceFor the third quarter, Royal Caribbean expects adjusted earnings per share to come in at $3.45. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.29 per share is pegged below the guidance.Constant-currency net yields are projected to increase in the range of 4-4.5%. Notably, solid demand trends for Europe and North America products are driving improvement over an already strong previous year.  NCC, excluding fuel, are likely to be up about 4% at constant currency.2017 Guidance UpdatedFor full-year 2017, the company now anticipates earnings in the band of $7.35 to $7.45 per share, up from the earlier guided range of $7–$7.20. Better-than-expected performance in the quarter along with favorable booking trends led to the improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at $7.24.The company expects net yields to increase in the range of 5.5% to 6%, on a constant currency basis, up slightly from the prior guidance of an increase in the range of 4.5-6%, given better results in the second quarter as well as stronger trends for the rest of the year.NCC, excluding fuel, on a constant currency basis, are expected to be up roughly 1%. Previously, the company expected the same to be flat to up slightly.The company stated that bookings continue to be very robust. In fact, its booked position for the rest of 2017 continues to set new records. Moreover, Royal Caribbean booked position for the next 12 months is also strong, and ahead of the same time last year, in both rate and volume.Other Cruise OperatorsCruise and vacation company Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results in June, with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Another cruise-line operator, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

411,CCL,"SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (SEAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 17.95%. SeaWorld surpassed expectations in only one of the last four quarters, the average being a positive 38.39% owing to a strong second-quarter 2017 beat.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to influence the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results.Historically, the first and the fourth quarters of each year are seasonally weak for SeaWorld. During the first nine months of 2017, the company’s revenues declined 7% from the prior-year period. The trend is expected to persist in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $260.7 million, implying a 2.6% decline from the year-ago quarter. Additionally, costs related to marketing and reputation campaigns as well as investments in new attractions might hurt profits. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company is anticipated to report a loss of 18 cents, showing a deterioration of 28.6% year over year.Moreover, SeaWorld’s total revenue per capita has been under pressure primarily due to lower attendance. Attendance in the first nine months of 2017 declined approximately 1.1 million guests, thanks to lower domestic and international attendance. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, we are optimistic about the company’s sincere efforts to control costs without denting efficiency and improve financial standing through debt refinancing. These factors are expected to drive upcoming results to some extent.Quantitative Model PredictionOur quantitative model predicts that SeaWorld does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: SeaWorld has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: SeaWorld carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

412,CCL,"Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp. (VAC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, this vacation ownership company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23.7%. Moreover, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is 14.5%.Let’s discuss how the company’s top and bottom line will shape up in the fourth-quarter 2017.Hurricane Impact to ContinueIn spite of continuous momentum in marketing platforms and sales distributions, the adverse impact of the hurricanes that took place in the third quarter is expected to mar Marriott Vacations’ fourth-quarter revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $497 million, implying 11.9% decline. In fact, the company anticipates a negative impact of $20 million on full-year contract sales due to the hurricanes.Increased Expenses to Dent ProfitThe company’s increased marketing expenses might pressurize margins as it is extensively marketing-oriented and relies heavily on sales initiatives to attract customers. Additionally, management expects that the utilization of rental availability for preview room nights to increase tours can dent rental margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, for the fourth quarter, the company expects adjusted EBITDA in the range of $64 million and $69 million. This compares unfavorably with the prior-year quarter, due to the change in the company’s reporting calendar. Since the first three quarters of 2017 benefited from an additional 22 days of operating results, the offset was noticed in the fourth quarter with 20 days less of operating results compared to 2016.These might have an adverse impact on the company’s profits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.16, implying 36.6% decrease.Our Quantitative Model Suggests a MissConsidering the headwinds, our quantitative model predicts that Marriott Vacations does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. Zacks ESP: Marriott Vacations has an Earnings ESP of -1.30%.

414,CCL,"Shares of cruise line companies surged on Tuesday after Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and signaled that the recent wave of tropical storms in the Caribbean didn’t destroy its bottom line.Carnival reported earnings of $2.29 per share (excluding $0.46 in non-recurring items), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.20 per share. The company also beat sales expectations, with $5.52 billion in revenues topping our estimate of $5.39 billion. Carnival’s quarterly revenues popped 8.2% and increased for the seventh straight quarter.What investors might appreciate even more is the fact that the string of powerful hurricanes in the Caribbean, including Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, did not greatly impact Carnival.The storm’s devastation would likely not have affected the company in its third quarter, but Carnival said that it expects to continue full-speed ahead during the holiday travel season, having avoided any major impact from the storms.""Many people throughout these areas have been impacted and several ports are temporarily unavailable,” Carnival President and CEO Arnold Donald said in a statement. “Fortunately, our owned destinations including Amber Cove, Dominican Republic; Cozumel, Mexico; Mahogany Bay, Honduras; Half Moon Cay and Princess Cays, Bahamas, as well as more than 40 other ports, plus all those in Mexico, are fully operational and welcoming guests.""The tropical storms did force Carnival to lower its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings and revenue projections slightly, but these estimates are still calling for year-over-year growth and are higher than previously anticipated.The company now expects full-year 2017 net revenues to climb 4%, which is up from its June guidance. Carnival projects to post fourth-quarter earnings between $0.44 and $0.50 per share and full-year earnings in the range of $3.64 to $3.70 a share.On top of this, Carnival's cumulative bookings for the first half of next year are ahead of last year’s rates. The company has also been able to boost its on-ship experiences, which helped it raise overall ticket prices 5%.Shares of Carnival climbed over 4% in morning trading to hit $66.25 per share, which is roughly $3.50 below its 52-week high. Carnival stock has already gained 40.53% year-to-date, blowing away the S&P 500 average of 10.18%.Rest of Industry Aside from the very real and devastating impact on homes, property, infrastructure, and peoples’ safety and lives, it seems that the string of Caribbean hurricanes have not really hurt the cruise industry.Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH  -  Free Report) popped over 2.75% on Tuesday, while Royal Caribbean (RCL  -  Free Report) saw its stock price jump over 3%.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

Revenues of $4.4 billion outpaced the consensus mark by $4.3 billion and increased 4.8% year over year. This year-over-year growth in revenues is driven by strength in passenger tickets, onboard and other, as well as tour and other businesses.Net revenue yields rose 4.8% year over year on a constant-currency basis.

417,CCL,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 22, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.2%. Norwegian Cruise Line has also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 3.8%.Notably, the stock’s impressive earnings history is well reflected in its robust price performance in a year's time. While the company has gained 24.7%, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry rallied 20.5%.Things look rosy for the company in the soon-to-be reported quarter as well. Strong passenger ticket revenues are likely to boost results.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings has remained stable at 63 cents per share over the last 30 days. However, this reflects a year-over-year improvement of 12.5%. The consensus mark for sales of $1.26 billion also indicates a 11.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.We expect Norwegian Cruise Line’s top line in the fourth quarter to be aided by increased ticket revenues. Additionally, improved pricing and an increase in Capacity Days should aid the company’s revenues. The impressive demand for cruise travel also seems to bode well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger ticket revenues in the quarter is pegged at $841 million, above $759 million reported by the company in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Additionally, Capacity Days are projected to increase approximately 9% year over year. Gross yield is anticipated to be higher on a year-over-year basis.Furthermore, the company is expected to benefit from robust marketing initiatives in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, we expect high costs to limit Norwegian Cruise Line’s bottom-line growth in the quarter. Investments undertaken by the company to upgrade the facilities for travel are also pushing up costs. Moreover, an increase in fuel prices is further likely to prove detrimental to the company’s earnings growth.What Does Our Model Indicate?Our proven model shows that Norwegian Cruise Line is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the stock has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Norwegian Cruise Line has an Earnings ESP of +0.32%.

418,CCL,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Carnival Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Carnival Corporation’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Carnival Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Carnival Corporation stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Carnival Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 2.9. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.6 right now. As we can see in the chart below, this is just marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.CCL is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Carnival Corporation currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Carnival Corporation a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Carnival Corporation is just 1.2, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.5. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.0, which is better than the industry average of 10.2. Clearly, CCL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Carnival Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B. This gives CCL a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current fiscal quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower, while the fiscal full year estimate has seen four upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current fiscal quarter consensus estimate has fallen by 8.7% in the past two months, while the fiscal full year estimate has inched up by 0.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Carnival Corporation Price and Consensus  Carnival Corporation Price and Consensus | Carnival Corporation QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCarnival Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 48% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. In fact, over the past three years, the industry has outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

419,CCL,"The market was up and down all week as investors remained uncertain exactly how to react to the continued trade war dispute between the U.S. and China. But there is no rest for the weary because remaining aware of what to expect from stocks ahead of earnings is still as important as ever.Tech giant Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and grocery power Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) both posted strong quarterly results this week.

This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’re giving investors a look ahead at some of next week’s biggest reports by using our Earnings Calendar. So let’s jump into what to expect from a few big-name companies set to report during the week of June 25.1. Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report)Shares of Carnival are down roughly 5% over the last year, including a dip of 2.7% during the last four weeks. Yet, one of the largest cruise companies in the world is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system and an overall “B” VGM score.Investors might also be pleased to note that the company is projected to see its quarterly revenues pop by 9.84% to hit $4.33 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. At the other end of the income statement, the company’s adjusted earnings are projected to reach $0.60 per share, which would mark a 15.38% surge from the year-ago period. Carnival is set to release its second-quarter financial results before the opening bell on Monday, June 25.2. Accenture PLC (ACN  -  Free Report)Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Accenture’s quarterly earnings to climb by 12.5% to reach $1.71 per share. Meanwhile, the company’s revenues are projected to hit $10.02 billion, representing a solid 12.97% gain from the year-ago period. Shares the professional services and management consulting firm have also trended in the right direction, up 31% over the last year.However, ACN is currently a Zacks Ranks #4 (Sell) based mostly on the fact that its quarterly earnings picture has trended in the wrong direction recently—with the most recent analyst estimates coming in slightly below our current $1.71 per share consensus. But this picture could change as we approach the release of Accenture’s Q3 financial results, which are due to be released before the market opens on Thursday, June 28.3. Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report)Shares of Paychex, which is a management solutions company for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services, have climbed 17% over the last year and 13% over the last 12 weeks.

Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted quarterly EPS figure is expected to surge by nearly 13% to touch $0.61 per share, with its full-year earnings projected to expand by 11.82% to hit $2.46 per share.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

420,CCL,"As the Q4 earnings season is ramping up, multiple reports will be flowing in this week. So far, the earnings picture looks encouraging. Per the Earnings Outlook  as of Jan 19, out of the 53 S&P 500 members that have posted their quarterly results so far, 81.1% surpassed earnings estimates, 75.5% beat revenues and 62.3% outpaced both earnings and sales.Further, total earnings for these companies have increased 11.7% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues. The report projects a 10.3% year-over-year rise in earnings for the S&P 500 companies with total revenues likely to increase 7.1%.A Mixed Bag for Consumer DiscretionaryWhile a few sectors are expected to put up a stellar show in Q4 earnings, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to post mixed results.Total earnings for the sector are likely to decline 2.4% year over year. Earnings in the last reported quarter grew 0.9% year over year. Total revenues are projected to grow 3.5% year over year in Q4, remaining flat with the prior quarter growth.Gaming Industry to See GrowthThe Gaming Industry, under Consumer Discretionary, has performed remarkably well in the past year. The industry has gained 39.4%, outpacing the S&P 500’s 26.3%.We expect the industry to have grown in the fourth quarter on increasing demand for gaming services and rapid expansion of these service providers.Reflecting the bullishness, casino giant Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected results for fourth-quarter 2017, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Moving on,Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Jan 24, after market close. Given the ongoing recovery in gaming revenues in Macao and continued improvement in the Las Vegas business, the stock is expected to perform well in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 77 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 24.2%. It is attributable to the company’s continuous improvement in margins which is driving earnings. While some companies in the leisure industry are grappling with margin pressure, Las Vegas Sands’ EBITDA margins have been consistently improving on continued focus on mass and non-gaming segments that carry higher margins.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,205 million, up from $3,075 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate also portrays sequential growth of 0.2% on the company’s solid business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets and attractive property locations. Additionally, a few planned entertainment offerings in the pipeline are expected to deliver profitable results across the company’s properties in the fourth quarter.

(RCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Jan 24, before the bell.Royal Caribbean’s top line is expected to be significantly driven by solid onboard revenues, strong performance of joint ventures and a decent book position. Subsequently, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.98 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 3.4%.The consensus estimate for EPS stands at $1.20, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 2.4% owing to rising costs. Royal Caribbean expects net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be up roughly 8.5%. Planned investments and revenue generating activities will further drive costs.

421,CCL,"Carnival Corporation’s (CCL  -  Free Report) continual expansion efforts and other revenue yielding strategies seem encouraging. However, higher costs along with negative currency translation continue to be potent headwinds.Last month, Carnival reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Earnings of 63 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents but were down 6.3% year over year. Revenues of $4.3 billion beat the consensus mark by $108 million and rose 8.2% year over year.Earnings also surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 12.33%.We observe that over the past year, the company’s shares have rallied 23%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20%.Launches & Expansion to Drive Demand & SalesCarnival continues to introduce flagships to drive demand. With frequent launches, the company aims to build capacity growth that allows its global fleet to meet escalating demand for cruise vacations around the world.In a recent press release, Carnival announced plans of launching four cruise ships this year as part of its current fleet enhancement strategy. While Carnival Horizon (belonging to Carnival Cruise Line brand) and Seabourn Ovation (Seabourn) will be launched in April and May, respectively, AIDAnova (AIDA Cruises) and ms Nieuw Statendam (Holland America Line) are slated for a December launch. Carnival has 18 new ships scheduled to be included in its portfolio of leading global cruise brands between 2018 and 2022.In fact, launching ships is part of the company’s long-term strategy to build state-of-the-art vessels which would help the company drive guest traffic. Moreover, Carnival continues to invest in its fleet to enhance guest experience.The leading cruise company is focused on growing beyond its familiar itineraries and capitalizing on new markets. The Asian source market for cruises is expected to grow significantly as it is becoming more consumer-driven. Carnival is especially optimistic about the prospects in China, Japan and Australia.Further, the company forayed into the markets of Cuba, Mexico and Bermuda where demand is expected to ramp up and boost revenues significantly. In fact, Carnival Cruise Line’s Carnival Paradise is the largest ship sailing from the United States to Havana and is capturing attractive ticket price premium. Carnival has more sailing scheduled to Cuba than any other major U.S. operator. This should help meet increased demand.The company is also focusing on port development to make use of its industry-leading scales to create better guest experiences. In this regard, the company recently signed a deal to construct a cruise port facility on the Grand Bahama Island.Strategic Initiatives Boost RevenuesCarnival continues to drive revenue growth by creating more demand than the estimated capacity growth through improved guest experience. In fiscal 2017, Carnival’s ticket prices increased 4.5%.The company is particularly positive on recent innovation like the transformational new ocean experience platform, featuring: Ocean Medallion, a guest experience platform, PlayOcean, a proprietary mobile gaming portfolio, and OceanView, a proprietary digital streaming network. These offerings are anticipated to enhance guest experience further by leveraging on its industry-leading scale.Meanwhile, the company believes it is well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength in bookings, particularly in Caribbean, Alaska, Europe, Asia and Australia. In fact, management noted that since November, booking volumes for 2018 have been exceeding that of last year at higher prices. Moreover, cumulative bookings for 2018 are well ahead of last year on both price and occupancy. Banking on its yield management system, the company expects revenue yields (in constant dollars) to continue improving in fiscal 2018.Moreover, to improve brand perception, Carnival is promoting its brands through documentaries, television programs, motion pictures and digital initiatives. Recently, the company created four original TV programs in order to engage viewers.High Costs & Other Macro WoesCarnival aims to make additional investments this year as its brands have identified more revenue generating opportunities. Though these efforts are expected to benefit the company over the long run, these would put pressure on near-term margins and earnings. Also, increased investments in advertising and TV programming are driving costs.Moreover, with a major portion of its revenues coming from Asia and Europe, the company is exposed to the impact of negative currency translation. Continual strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of the company’s foreign operations is likely to impact results. Additionally, higher fuel prices are likely to impede earnings growth.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCarnival has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector  are Clarus Corporation (CLAR  -  Free Report), Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report).

Meanwhile, gross revenue yields increased 5.5%. Carnival Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Carnival Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Carnival Corporation QuoteSegment Revenues Carnival earns revenues from its Passenger Tickets business, Onboard and Other as well as Tour and Other segments. Passenger Tickets: Passenger Tickets revenues increased 8.8% year over year to $4.14 billion. Onboard and Other: Onboard and Other revenues were $1.22 billion, up 6.7% year over year. Tour and Other: Revenues from this segment increased 4.1% year over year to $154 million. Expenses Net cruise costs (in constant dollar) per available lower berth day (ALBD), excluding fuel and impairments, inched up 0.2%, almost in line with the June guidance of approximately flat.

424,CCL,"Looking for economic data? You’ve come to the right week. Only trouble is, most of it is coming out after the opening bell today and beyond — which means, by definition, after the Ahead of Wall Street column is published. August New Home Sales and September Consumer Confidence reports come out at 10am ET. Also, Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks this afternoon, as do other Fed players — specifically Lael Brainard, Loretta Mester and Raphael Bostic. After today’s closing bell, we will see fiscal Q1 2018 earnings results from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Ahead of today’s start to normal-day trading, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index report came in slightly better than expected: 5.9% versus 5.7% for the month of July. Yes, this data is from the middle of summer, but is considered to be the most accurate of all metrics regarding U.S. home pricing. This is something the Fed should be happy to see — that real estate price growth is higher than analysts were anticipating — because this lends itself to increased inflation, which will help the Fed (finally) see its 2% goal. Even if this takes longer than expected, increased home pricing is better than a decrease.The other side of the Fed’s dual mandate, apart from 2% inflation, is job growth. This has been solid for the past year and even previously. What has puzzled economists is the lack of wage growth, and on this issue, a new report released by The Hamilton Project, headed by a Brookings Institute fellow, indicates we have seen 0.2% wage growth over the past year. This report, which looks at more than four decades’ worth of data, tracks how productivity and wage growth has decoupled.From 1947 through roughly 1977, wage growth and productivity were in-line with one another. By the late 1990s, productivity had zoomed past wage growth. It flattened during the Great Recession in the last decade, and has been up only gradually ever since. But productivity is still far above wage growth in 2017.Companies like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) independently raising its minimum wage — reported on here by Zacks’ Maddy Johnson — should help a bit, but only if all other retailers, restaurants, etc. follow suit. One company is not enough to create wage growth pressure, which is exactly what is needed for that inflation metric to hit the Fed’s goals.As mentioned above, we expect some interesting statements from Fed Chair Yellen and other members of the Federal Reserve today. Perhaps markets will take direction from these statements later today and for the rest of the week.Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) CEO Richard Smith is stepping down from his post effective today, a couple weeks after news that 143 million Americans’ data has been compromised by a breach at the company. The stock has fallen precipitously since this news report, and looks to open lower again today.Finally, Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL  -  Free Report) has beaten earnings estimates for at least the fifth consecutive quarter, topping fiscal Q3 2017 estimates by 9 cents per share and coming out ahead of revenue estimates as well. The company did report it expects hurricane and damages in the Caribbean to have a negative effect on Q4 results, but shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.

425,CCL,"Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, has arrived at an agreement to acquire TWC Enterprises Limited's White Pass & Yukon Route (WP&YR) division. WP&YR comprises White Pass' port, railroad and retail operations in Skagway, AK. Subject to customary conditions, the transaction is slated to close on Jul 31.Along with the merger agreement, Holland America Princess Alaska Tours also implemented a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Survey Point Holdings, Inc. Under the MOU, Survey Point will be jointly managing the acquired division. The agreement is finalized on the condition that Survey Point and its affiliate will own a majority stake in the company while Carnival will retain a minority position.Strategic Initiatives to Capitalize on Opportunities in AlaskaThe move underscores Carnival’s strategic initiatives to market itself and enhance its booking environment in Alaska. By keeping the Skagway port locally owned and independently operated, the company remains committed to the continued development in Alaska, which is already a popular tourism destination. By making investments in Skagway and the surrounding regions, Carnival aims to accelerate economic development and job growth, which will have a positive impact on the local economy and further benefit the Alaska tourism industry.Meanwhile, the company believes that it is well positioned for continued earnings growth, given the current strength in its bookings, particularly in Caribbea, Alaska, Europe, Asia and Australia, along with pricing trends for 2018. In fact, management noted that since November, booking volumes for 2018 have been better than the last year at relatively higher prices. Moreover, cumulative bookings for 2018 are still well ahead of the prior year on both press and occupancy at this point of time. It thus expects revenue yields (in constant dollars) to continue improving in fiscal 2018, backed by marketing initiatives and a better booking environment.Share Price MovementThe company’s shares have lost 8.1% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 8.7%. However, we believe that strategic initiatives to expand the cruise’s capacity by upgrading current ships, increasing the fleet and attracting greater number of leisure travelers will help the stock to gain in the near term.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Carnival carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the leisure space include Lindblad Expeditions (LIND  -  Free Report), Six Flags Entertainment (SIX  -  Free Report) and RCI Hospitality (RICK  -  Free Report).

426,CCL,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for a short horizon investor to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage”, which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of “A” or “B” to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of ‘A’ or ‘B’ when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), which operates as a homebuilding company, has a VGM score of “A” and an expected EPS growth rate of 16.7% for 3–5 years. The stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV  -  Free Report), which operates a passenger airline, has a VGM score of “A” and an expected EPS growth rate of 10.2% for 3–5 years. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the designing, building, overhauling and repairing of ships, has a VGM score of “B” and an expected EPS growth rate 15% for 3–5 years.

427,CCL,"With more than 25 million passengers expected to sail this year, as per Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), 2017 might just prove to be the year for the cruise ships.In fact, the industry as a whole continues to respond to the desires of today’s travelers through technological advancements as well as via deployment of new ships to new ports and destinations around the world. This, in turn, is resulting in steady growth and strong economic impact around the world. Evidently, 26 new ships have been announced to debut in 2017 for a total investment of more than $6.8 billion in new ocean vessels, as of Dec 2016.Industry insiders too expect demand for cruise ships to remain strong throughout this year, thereby making it the right time to add a few cruise companies to your portfolio. Miami-based, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report), one of the major players in the cruise segment, is one stock which is worth considering.What Makes Norwegian Cruise Line a Solid Pick?Stock Price Movement: Norwegian Cruise Line shares have rallied 17% in the last six months outperforming the Zacks categorized Leisure and Recreation Services industry’s gain of 15.8%.  Given increasing demand for business and leisure travel, along with the current strength in its bookings and capacity growth, the stock should keep performing well in the quarters ahead.Earnings & Revenue Growth: Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company in question.While Norwegian Cruise Line has a historical earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 17.8%, investors should really focus on its projected growth. Here, the company is looking to grow at a rate of 22%, higher than the industry average of 14.3%.Propelling the earnings forward is the company’s solid revenue growth story. Evidently, its last five years revenue growth is 21.9% better than the industry’s average of 5.3%. Moreover, projected sales growth for the current year is 8.7%, which is higher than the broader industry’s estimate of 5%.Favorable ROE: Norwegian Cruise Line’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Also, the company’s ROE of 16.76% has increased over the years. Further, it compares favorably with the Zacks categorized Leisure and Recreation Services industry’s ROE of 12.10%, reflecting the fact that it is efficient in using shareholders’ funds.Positive Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Norwegian Cruise Line’s current quarter earnings has moved up over 1%, reflecting one upward revision versus none downward, over the last 60 days. Also, current year’s earnings estimates have climbed 0.3%, on the back of one upward revision versus no downward revision. All these positive earnings estimates revision testifies the unwavering confidence that analysts have in the company and substantiate the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock.

Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth, and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 make solid investment choices.Bottom LineAdverse forex translations, an increase in fuel prices, along with lingering global uncertainties in certain international markets may prove detrimental to the company’s growth prospects. Besides, Norwegian Cruise Line also faces competition from other large cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) and Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report).Nonetheless, given the company’s strong fundamentals, strong bookings trend and burgeoning demand for cruise travel in 2017, the stock should keep performing well in the near term, thereby making it a top investment choice.Another top-ranked stock in the same sector is Cedar Fair, L.P. (FUN  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cedar Fair’s current quarter earnings moved up nearly 1%, over the past 60 days. Further, for 2017, its EPS is expected to grow 12.7%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Revenues of $4.3 billion beat the consensus mark by $108 million and surged 8.2% year over year.

429,CCL,"Shares of Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) jumped on Tuesday morning after the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 earnings, helping lift the rest of the cruise industry, including Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH  -  Free Report) and Royal Caribbean (RCL  -  Free Report).Carnival reported adjusted Q4 earnings of $0.63 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.50 per share. The company also topped sales expectations and posted revenues of $4.26 billion, which marked over an 8% year-over-year climb.The most recent quarter also marked the eighth consecutive period that Carnival posted a sales increase. The cruise operator beat full-year revenue and earnings expectations, and the company’s solid fourth-quarter comes after a series of devastating hurricanes wreaked havoc on a many cruise ship hubs and routes.Carnival’s strong year stems in part from the fact it was able to raise its prices. In fiscal 2017, the cruise company’s ticket prices rose by 4.5%.Looking ahead, the company noted its prices will be on the rise again in 2018. Furthermore, Carnival announced that its cumulative advanced bookings for 2018 are ahead of the prior year, “at higher prices.”""Despite booking disruptions from this year's multiple hurricanes, we are still heading into 2018 with a stronger base of business and higher prices than last year,” CEO Arnold Donald said in a statement.“We have numerous efforts underway to keep the momentum going in 2018 and beyond, from our innovative approaches to increase consideration for cruising, including our recently announced partnership with Univision, to the further roll-out of our state-of-the-art revenue management system.”What’s more, Carnival announced that it expects to post first-quarter 2018 EPS in the range of $0.37 to $0.41.

430,CCL,"Tuesday, September 26, 2017Looking for economic data? You’ve come to the right week. Only trouble is, most of it is coming out after the opening bell today and beyond — which means, by definition, after the Ahead of Wall Street column is published. August New Home Sales and September Consumer Confidence reports come out at 10am ET. Also, Fed Chair Janet Yellen speaks this afternoon, as do other Fed players — specifically Lael Brainard, Loretta Mester and Raphael Bostic. After today’s closing bell, we will see fiscal Q1 2018 earnings results from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Ahead of today’s start to normal-day trading, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index report came in slightly better than expected: 5.9% versus 5.7% for the month of July. Yes, this data is from the middle of summer, but is considered to be the most accurate of all metrics regarding U.S. home pricing. This is something the Fed should be happy to see — that real estate price growth is higher than analysts were anticipating — because this lends itself to increased inflation, which will help the Fed (finally) see its 2% goal. Even if this takes longer than expected, increased home pricing is better than a decrease.The other side of the Fed’s dual mandate, apart from 2% inflation, is job growth. This has been solid for the past year and even previously. What has puzzled economists is the lack of wage growth, and on this issue, a new report released by The Hamilton Project, headed by a Brookings Institute fellow, indicates we have seen 0.2% wage growth over the past year. This report, which looks at more than four decades’ worth of data, tracks how productivity and wage growth has decoupled.From 1947 through roughly 1977, wage growth and productivity were in-line with one another. By the late 1990s, productivity had zoomed past wage growth. It flattened during the Great Recession in the last decade, and has been up only gradually ever since. But productivity is still far above wage growth in 2017.Companies like Target (TGT  -  Free Report) independently raising its minimum wage — reported on here by Zacks’ Maddy Johnson — should help a bit, but only if all other retailers, restaurants, etc. follow suit. One company is not enough to create wage growth pressure, which is exactly what is needed for that inflation metric to hit the Fed’s goals.As mentioned above, we expect some interesting statements from Fed Chair Yellen and other members of the Federal Reserve today. Perhaps markets will take direction from these statements later today and for the rest of the week.Equifax (EFX  -  Free Report) CEO Richard Smith is stepping down from his post effective today, a couple weeks after news that 143 million Americans’ data has been compromised by a breach at the company. The stock has fallen precipitously since this news report, and looks to open lower again today.Finally, Carnival Cruise Lines (CCL  -  Free Report) has beaten earnings estimates for at least the fifth consecutive quarter, topping fiscal Q3 2017 estimates by 9 cents per share and coming out ahead of revenue estimates as well. The company did report it expects hurricane and damages in the Caribbean to have a negative effect on Q4 results, but shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

431,CCL,"Headquartered in Miami, FL, Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) operates as a cruise and vacation company. Notably, Carnival’s cruise ships offer various itineraries to passengers under leading cruise brands through its four primary segments — North America cruise brands, EAA cruise brands, Cruise Support and Tour and Other. Carnival has adopted a strategy to grow beyond its familiar itineraries and capitalize on Asian opportunities.

432,CCL,"SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 numbers on May 5, before the opening bell.This Israel-based manufacturer of household soda witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 44.87% last quarter, recording an average beat of 40.40% in the last four quarters.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up for the first quarter —SodaStream banks heavily on the growing demand for its sparkling water. The company’s cost-effective beverage carbonation systems help consumers transform ordinary tap water into soft drinks and sparkling water, providing a healthier alternative to carbonated sugary drinks. Owing to a shift in consumer preference toward healthier sparkling water, SodaStream repositioned itself in the United States to capitalize on this.In 2017, the sparkling water maker’s unit sales increased 24%, while its gas refill units surged 11% year over year. We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 revenues is pegged at $131.9 million, reflecting 14.4% year-over-year growth.Cost savings and product margin expansions realized from the consolidation of its manufacturing and logistics operations, along with optimization efforts related to expense and inventory management, bode well.However, the company intends to increase investment in capacity expansion and improved production processes in 2018, which will obviously lead to increased costs. Therefore, the consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 66 cents, flat year over year.Also, owing to SodaStream’s extensive international presence, negative currency translation poses a threat.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model shows that SodaStream is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: SodaStream has an Earnings ESP of +6.06%.

434,CCL,"According to a report by Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association (FCCA), 2017 has been a prosperous year for the cruise industry. In line with the industry’s growth, leading U.S. cruise companies — Carnival Corp. (CCL  -  Free Report) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) — are trying out different strategies to drive growth. The companies are also leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the lucrative opportunities in China.By 2020, China’s cruise market is projected to grow to 4.5 million passengers, up from 1 million in 2015, per data by the Chinese Ministry of Transport. To tap into the prospects, Royal Caribbean is directing its technologically advanced ships to the rapidly growing cruise market of the country. Meanwhile, Carnival has entered into a joint venture with China’s largest shipbuilder — China State Shipbuilding Corp. — to place an order for two cruise ships.With both the companies carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), let’s find out which company is placed better with respect to other parameters.Price Performance and ValuationWhile the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services Industry has gained 25.8% so far this year, Royal Caribbean has rallied 52.4%. Carnival’s gain of 26.6% has also surpassed that of the industry. Meanwhile, a look at the EV/EBIT ratio shows that the valuation of the companies is stretched.The most suitable ratio to evaluate these cruise lines is EV/EBIT. This metric is commonly used for several media sub groups as well as chemicals, gaming, bus and rail industries. This ratio is also preferred over EBITDA because of the wide difference in the companies’ asset financing patterns.We note that for the industry as a whole, the EV/EBIT ratio stands at 13.53, slightly undervalued when compared to the S&P 500’s 14.6x.The cruise lines are overvalued when compared with the broader industry. However, Carnival has an edge here with a lower EV/EBIT value of 14.7, compared to Royal Caribbean’s 19.8x. Debt Ratio Since the sector has high financial leverage, the debt-to-asset ratio comes into the picture. This measures the ability of a company to service long-term debt. Hospitality stocks should ideally have lower debt ratios, implying higher proportion of the company’s assets over the long term.Here, Carnival is at an advantage with a debt ratio of 22.6% compared with Royal Caribbean’s 34.4%. The industry average for the same is 28.5%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionRoyal Caribbean and Carnival have beat earnings in each of the last four quarters. While Royal Caribbean has an average positive earnings surprise of 3.15%, Carnival’s average is 9.71%. However, Royal Caribbean’s Earnings ESPof +0.18% lends it an edge over Carnival, which has an Earnings ESP of -4.48%.For the current year, Royal Caribbean’s earnings are expected to grow 21.6%, higher than Carnival’s projected EPS growth of 7.2%.Looking at earnings estimate revisions, Royal Caribbean and Carnival have unchanged revisions over the past month.Net MarginTraditionally, gross margin for cruise companies is comparatively higher as majority of the expenses comes from cost of operations and not cost of goods sold. However, the sector’s profits are not very high which is best captured by net profit margin or net margin. The industry’s trailing twelve-month net margin is 12.6, while that for Carnival and Royal Caribbean are 18.4% and 15.5%, respectively. It is to be noted that Royal Caribbean’s profit-driving initiatives have helped the company drive margins higher than Carnival.Final ThoughtsOur comparative analysis shows that although Carnival has an edge over Royal Caribbean, debt ratio and higher projected EPS growth put Royal Caribbean in the lead. Also, in terms of margins and share price movement, Royal Caribbean has clearly outperformed Carnival.Stocks to ConsiderTwo better-ranked stocks in the industry are H.I.S.

435,CCL,"Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) is slated to release fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 results on Dec 19, before the market opens.Carnival’s revenues are expected to perform strongly in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis. However, earnings are likely to be hurt by continuous investments and ongoing impacts of hurricanes and typhoons.Notably, shares of Carnival have rallied 26.6% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 25.8%.Here are the expectations in detail.All Revenue Segments to Grow on Carnival’s Efforts to Drive DemandCarnival earns revenues from its Passenger Tickets business, Onboard and Other as well as Tour and Other segments, all of which are expected to perform strongly in the to-be-reported quarter on a year-over-year basis.Passenger Tickets revenues are expected to increase year over year driven by strong pricing on closing bookings on both sides of the Atlantic. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $3.04 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6%. In the third quarter, passenger tickets revenues increased 8.8% year over year.Tour and Other revenues are likely to improve driven by the current strength in bookings, particularly in the Caribbean, Alaska, Europe, Asia and Australia along with favorable pricing trends. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s revenues is pegged at $41.4 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 23.9%. Revenues from this segment increased 4.1% year over year in the third quarter.Onboard and Other revenues will carry on the momentum of the third quarter (up 6.7% year over year), the segment is anticipated to record improvement in the quarter. Growth will be driven by the company’s ongoing initiatives to increase revenues.These include offering all-inclusive spa packages, beverage packages, and specialty restaurants and strengthening onboard bar and casino programs along with using various marketing and promotional tools. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for onboard and other segment revenues is pegged at $1.09 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.2%.Strength across all segments will contribute significantly toward year-over-year growth of Carnival’s total revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for which is currently pegged at $4.15 billion, representing an increase of 5.8%.Carnival Corporation Revenue (TTM) Carnival Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Carnival Corporation QuoteNet Revenue Yields to Benefit from Higher Net ticket, Net On-board and Other YieldsWhile ticket yields are likely to be driven by the Carnival’s deployment of North American brands in Caribbean, Europe and Alaska; net on-board and other yields will see strengths on both sides of the Atlantic.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net revenue yields is pegged at $165 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 3.8%. This metric increased 5.1% year over year in the third quarter.Occupancy Percentage to be Driven by Improved Guest ExperiencesThis metric is antcipated to go up on year-over-year basis driven by the increasing efforts to improve guest experiences and global consideration of cruise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 104%, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1%. This metric stayed more or less flat year over year in the third quarter.Investments and Weather Impacts to Hurt EPSThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pegged at 50 cents, reflecting year-over-year decrease by 16% year over year. The expected decrease can be attributable to increased investments in environmental and other areas, higher operating cost in Australia, rise in net cruise cost excluding fuel and additional expenses resulting from cancelled voyages due to hurricanes and typhoons.In the third quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings per share increased 20% year over year.Our Model Doesn’t Suggest a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

437,CCL,"As Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) approaches the end of its Double-Double program, bookings are at record levels, dividends are at an all-time high, costs have been well managed and guest satisfaction has improved significantly.Consequently, the company’s shares have rallied 51.9% in the past year, as against the industry’s growth of 25.1%.The company has thus once again developed a multi-year period program named — 20/20 Vision — that leverages the culture and the discipline instilled by the Double-Double program while including a broader set of goals.Meanwhile, Royal Caribbean posted mixed third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues lagged the same. Though strong close-in booking and pricing trends bolstered the quarterly performance, hurricanes had a negative impact on the same.In fact, the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Key Growth DriversGiven the strength and diversity of its brands and itineraries, the company has successfully captured potential and repeat cruise vacationers and enjoys immense popularity among cruisers.We note that Royal Caribbean’s Asia-Pacific itineraries have been mostly performing strongly over the past few quarters. Though the China market has been recently experiencing bumps in the road, it is poised to be a long-term growth driver. Per data from the Chinese Ministry of Transport, China’s cruise market is projected to grow to 4.5 million passengers, up from 1 million in 2015. Also, the country is expected to become the world's second-largest cruise market by 2030, after the United States.Demand for European sailings, both in the Mediterranean and Baltics, has been particularly strong from North America. Meanwhile, although demand for Caribbean sailings softened as the recent hurricanes moved to the Caribbean and Gulf beginning in late August, virtually all its bookings in the region are back to pre-storm levels.In fact, the company stated that bookings continue to be very robust. Booking volumes have been up more for sailings that are further out, given the ongoing extension of the booking window. Management noted that they are experiencing strong early booking trends for 2018. Notably, Royal Caribbean is benefiting from its global sourcing model, revenue management strategies and the price integrity program.Given the consistent increase in bookings, the company is required to increase its capacity. Notably, with upcoming fleet launches like Symphony of the Seas — arriving in spring of 2018 — and Celebrity Edge that debuts in the fall of 2018, it expects to meet this requirement comfortably. Also, Royal Caribbean recently announced that Azamara Pursuit will join Azamara Club Cruises brand, which increases the company’s capacity there and upgrades its capabilities.Over the next three years, 20/20 Vision is expected to serve as a guiding light for the organization and build on its proven formula for success of modest yield and capacity growth, strong cost control along with efforts to enhance customer advocacy and employee engagement.Going forward, Royal Caribbean aims to improve its already excellent guest satisfaction and employee engagement while delivering its environmental commitments, under 20/20 Vision program. These operational drivers are expected to aid in further improving its double-digit return profile and deliver double-digit earnings per share by the end of 2020.Bottom LineDoes this mean that the company has been lying on a bed of roses? Well, not really!Adverse forex translations, a potential rise in fuel prices and lingering global uncertainties in certain international markets might continue to keep growth at check.Royal Caribbean as well as the other cruise operators is experiencing a decrease in demand for their China sailings due to restrictions on travel to South Korea, given the recent dispute between Chinese-Korean governments. This, in turn, is resulting in less-than-ideal itineraries and lower pricing. Consequently, the company’s business might suffer due to the volatility of the overall Chinese tourism industry.Furthermore, higher-than-anticipated load factors, timing and investment in revenue-generating activities are adding to the company’s costs. In fact, Royal Caribbean expects net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be up about 8.5% year over year in fourth quarter on a constant-currency basis. This increase in the cost metric is anticipated to be driven by planned sales and marketing investments, timing of third quarter costs and lower-than-expected Available Passenger Cruise Days (APCD) due to the recent hurricanes.The company also faces competition from other cruise operators including Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report).Despite the headwinds, Royal Caribbean is well poised for growth given its strong fundamentals, strong bookings trend, various strategic initiatives and an expected increase in demand for cruise travel, going forward.Royal Caribbean currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the industry is Vail Resorts, Inc. (MTN  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For fiscal 2018, Vail Resorts’ EPS is expected to grow 18.8%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Revenues of $4.2 billion outpaced the consensus mark by $120.9 million and increased 11.6% year over year. This top-line growth year over year was driven by strength across passenger tickets, onboard and other, and tour and other businesses.Net revenue yields rose 3.9% year over year on a constant-currency basis. The upswing can be attributed to higher net ticket, and net on-board and other yields that increased 4% and 3.9%, respectively, in constant currency.In the reported quarter, the company benefited from ongoing guest experience efforts along with marketing and public relations programs that drove cruise ticket prices.Notably, shares of Carnival have rallied 5.8% in the past six months, slightly outperforming the industry’s gain of 5.7%. Let’s delve deeper into the numbers.Revenues by SegmentsCarnival generates revenues from its Passenger Tickets business, Onboard and Other as well as Tour and Other segments.

Net cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, are anticipated to rise in the range of 4-5% from the prior year figure, on a constant-dollar basis.Based on the above factors, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of 56-60 cents. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 50 cents per share.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceThe company raised its fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.20-$4.40, up from the previously guided range of $4.00-$4.30.Based on current booking trends, the company expects fiscal 2018 net revenue yields, in constant currency, to be up approximately 2.5% compared with the previous year.

439,CCL,"Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the market opens.In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.9%. Norwegian Cruise Line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of approximately 5.9%.However, things do not look rosy for the company in the soon-to-be reported quarter. High costs owing to the upsurge in fuel prices are likely to hurt results.In fact, the stock has been grappling with high operating expenses for quite some time. This is evident from the company’s disappointing price movement in a year’s time. While the stock has shed  2.9% of its value, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry gained 0.8%.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.We expect high costs to limit bottom-line growth at Norwegian Cruise Line in the first quarter of 2018. In the last reported quarter, an increase in cruise operating expenses affected the company’s earnings growth and the first quarter is unlikely to be any different. Rise in fuel costs are primarily responsible for pushing up total expenses. The company expects fuel price per metric ton, net of hedges, to be $450 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Also, oil prices have been on an uptrend lately and were up approximately 8% in the January-to-March period. We note that high oil prices do not bode well for travel-focussed companies like Norwegian Cruise Line as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.This apart, investments undertaken by the company to upgrade the facilities for travel are also pushing up costs, which are likely to hurt the bottom line in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Net Cruise Cost per Capacity Day in the quarter is pegged at $154, above $145 unveiled by the company in the fourth quarter of 2017.Moreover, foul weather, which was prevalent in the January-to-March period, might hurt results as well. In fact, higher marketing and promotional expenses along with increased cruise costs are likely to dent margins.However, increased ticket revenues should boost Norwegian Cruise Line’s top line in the soon-to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for passenger ticket revenues in the first quarter of 2018 stands at $875 million, above $787 million unveiled by the company a year ago.  Additionally, Capacity Days are projected to increase approximately 11% year over year.Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.

440,CCL,"Mohawk Industries, Inc. (MHK  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.7%. Moreover, Mohawk surpassed expectations in all of the last four quarters, the average being 1.6%.Introduction of innovative products across its portfolio is expected to improve segment and boost overall sales, which will be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results. The company has been launching higher value products, adding service centers and unique merchandise. The company’s capital expenditure rose to around $900 million in 2017.The company intends to invest additional $750 million in 2018. Mohawk is expected to benefit in the to-be-reported quarter from the expansion of LVT in the United States and Europe; ceramic capacity increases in the United States, Mexico, Italy, Poland, Bulgaria and Russia; luxury laminate in the United States, Europe and Russia; carpet tile in Europe; sheet vinyl in Russia; countertops in the United States and Europe; and carpet and rugs in the United States.This apart, the company is likely to benefit from its strategy of driving growth through acquisitions, which will be evident in the to-be-reported quarter. Since the beginning of 2017, the company has made four acquisitions. The buyouts have enhanced the company’s product portfolio and expanded geographic footprint and market share. While these acquisitions have contributed to the company’s top line, Mohawk is also undertaking initiatives to improve the performance of the acquired companies. Such measures include the implementation of new strategies and transformation of organizational structures.However, increased raw material costs as well as start-up expenses behind new products and production continue to raise concerns.Taking all these factors into consideration, the company expects first-quarter EPS in the range of $2.93-$3.02 compared with $2.72 reported in the prior-year quarter. Also, earnings will benefit from a stronger euro and reduced global tax rate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.01, reflecting an increase of 10.7% year over year. The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.41 billion, reflecting an increase of 8.7% year over year.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model shows that Mohawk is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Mohawk has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.21%.

442,CCL,"The Q1 reporting cycle is underway with 87 S&P 500 members having released their quarterly numbers (as of Apr 20). Per the latest Earnings Preview, of the 87 S&P 500 companies that have already reported, 82.8% surpassed earnings estimates, 67.8% beat revenue estimates and 62.1% outpaced on both counts. Further, total earnings of these companies increased 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues.The report projects an 18.3% year-over-year rise in earnings for the S&P 500 companies, with total revenues likely to increase 7.7%. This compares favorably with year-over-year increase of 13.4% for earnings in the fourth quarter but unfavorably with 8.6% year-over-year revenue growth in the last reported quarter.Consumer Discretionary Sector Poised for GrowthLike some other sectors, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to put up a stellar show in Q1 earnings.Currently, the domestic economy is favorable for the consumer discretionary sector. The overall economy shows increased consumer demand for goods and services. According to the Fed’s latest forecast, the economy will grow at a reasonable rate of 2.7% in 2018.

447,CCL,"Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (LYV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, after market close. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 3.64%. Live Nation surpassed/met expectations in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being a positive 20.58% owing to a strong second-quarter 2017 beat.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to affect the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results.All segments (Concerts, Advertising and Ticketing), especially the Concerts segment, have been witnessing revenue growth backed by higher ticket sales over the last few quarters. We expect this trend to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Additionally, various digital initiatives undertaken by Live Nation are likely to improve the ticket booking experience and further drive the top line. Meanwhile, its food and beverage initiative at amphitheaters continues to improve on-site experience, consequently driving increased spend per customer. This initiative, coupled with the addition of more points of sale as well as continuous refinement of its product assortment and pricing are anticipated to boost concert business profitability.Moreover, Live Nation's ticketing business that operates under the well-known brand, Ticketmaster, has been posting solid revenues for the last few quarters. Also, the company boasts a significant presence in this high-margin agency business where it charges a fee for selling tickets on behalf of its clients. Thus, we expect the momentum of revenue growth to continue in the Ticketing segment.Meanwhile, its sponsorship & advertising business has been well-balanced between sponsorship and online advertising, with both parts of the business growing revenues and adjusted operating income in double digits through the first nine months of 2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s sales is pegged at $2.06 billion, reflecting an increase of 14.9% year over year.However, the overall macro environment might dent Live Nation’s revenues to some extent. Per management’s last conference call, forex had an adverse impact of 1% on the company’s business in the third quarter but was becoming less of an issue in the quarter under review.That said, the company typically experiences lowest financial performance in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year as its outdoor venues are primarily used and festivals primarily occur during May through October. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company is anticipated to report a loss of $1.08, showing a deterioration of 86.2% year over year.Quantitative Model PredictionOur proven model shows that Live Nation does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat in the fourth quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at -3.06%.Zacks Rank: Live Nation has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

449,CCL,"Hurricane Irma has grown into a massive Category 5 storm that is now surging through the Caribbean towards Florida. Irma’s looming threat to the large tropical island area has already triggered evacuation measures and other hurricane-based precautions. The hurricane also helped to sink stocks with strong ties to the Caribbean tourism industry on Tuesday.Irma UpdateThe National Hurricane Center recently updated its assessment of Hurricane Irma and outlined details of the tropical storm’s likely path though the Caribbean.“Irma is a potentially catastrophic category 5 hurricane and will bring life-threatening wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards to portions of the northeastern Leeward Islands beginning later today and the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico beginning tomorrow,” the NHC said in a statement on Tuesday.The center also issued hurricane watches for a portion of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, the southeastern Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos.

The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Carnival Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.8, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.1. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Carnival Corporation’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 19.7) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Carnival Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 18.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Carnival Corporation’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Carnival Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 3.0. This is slightly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is marginally below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, Carnival Corporation is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Carnival Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CCL a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Carnival Corporation is just 1.4, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.5. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 6.44, which is considerably better than the industry average of 7.9. Clearly, CCL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Carnival Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B. This gives CCL a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The full-year 2017 has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower, while the full-year 2018 estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the full-year 2017 consensus estimate has inched up 0.5% in the past two months, while the full-year 2018 estimate has inched up 0.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Carnival Corporation Price and Consensus  Carnival Corporation Price and Consensus | Carnival Corporation QuoteThis somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineCarnival Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Its strong Zacks Rank also indicates robust growth potential in the near future. However, the company’s prospects might be constrained due to adverse broader factors, as it has a sluggish industry rank (bottom 32% out of more than 250 industries). In fact, over the past two years, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

451,CCL,"Cruise and vacation company, Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report), is expected to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 25, before market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.64%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 9.08%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Carnival Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Carnival Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Carnival Corporation QuoteFactors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsDuring the second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call, the company had issued a guidance of $2.16-$2.20 adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal third quarter. Carnival had factored in year-over-year growth in net revenue yields (constant dollars) of roughly 4% and a flat year-over-year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, while projecting its earnings per share.We are positive on Carnival’s strategy to grow beyond its familiar itineraries and capitalize on new markets. In fact, the company is confident about its fiscal third-quarter results to reflect growth in China and other Asian markets as well as expansion in relatively other untapped markets like Cuba, Bermuda and Mexico.Notably, last year, the company had launched the initial phase of its yield management system, which is expected to aid in driving incremental revenue yields in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, Carnival predicts the quarter’s revenue yields to improve on the back of marketing initiatives, enhancement of guest experiences and a better booking environment.Moreover, the company remains focused on its cost-containment efforts, including decreased fuel consumption that is likely to aid the quarter’s margins.However, higher investment in marketing increased marketing expenses might hamper the quarter’s margins. Higher fuel costs and adverse foreign exchange movements may also weigh on the company’s profits. Meanwhile, macroeconomic issues in key operating regions remain concerns for the company’s top line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Carnival this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Carnival has an Earnings ESP of -0.31%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.19, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $2.20. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Carnival has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Notably, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (VAC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.61% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.V.F. Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.Interface, Inc.

453,CCL,"Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) continues to expand and adopt strategic initiatives to improve performance. Also, the company’s cruise brands are well diversified across diverse geographies, including Asia and Europe, and strategically positioned at various price points within the larger North American cruise market.Consequently, the stock has gained 9.4% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rally of 7.8%. However, in the past three months, the company has lost its momentum and witnessed a decline of 6.4%. Let’s delve deeper to find out the factors influencing the company’s performance.Hidden CatalystsCarnival keeps introducing new flagships to create opportunities for additional demand. In June 2017, the company’s Germany-based AIDA Cruises brand had launched AIDAperla — one of the most environmentally friendly and technologically advanced ships globally. Again, in March, it launched Majestic Princess from Princess Cruises, which is the world's first cruise ship built specifically for the Chinese market.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also declared that it will launch four new cruise ships in 2018 as part of its current fleet enhancement strategy. While Carnival Horizon (belonging to Carnival Cruise Line brand) and Seabourn Ovation (Seabourn) are expected to be launched in mid-2018, AIDAnova (AIDA Cruises) and ms Nieuw Statendam (Holland America Line) are slated for a December launch. Currently, Carnival has 18 new ships listed to be included in its portfolio of leading global cruise brands between 2018 and 2022.Furthermore, Carnival has adopted a strategy to grow beyond its familiar itineraries and capitalize on new markets. In fact, the Asian source market for cruises is expected to continue growing significantly as it becomes more consumer-driven. Carnival is especially optimistic about the growth prospects of the Japanese and Australian markets.These countries boast a rapidly developing cruise market, with passenger numbers soaring over the past few years that is expected to rise further. Notably, growing middle-class with high disposable income makes these markets an attractive bet for Carnival. Moreover, an increasing number of ports and tourist destinations in Asia offer tremendous growth opportunity for the cruise industry. Moving ahead, the company expects to continue growing its presence in China and throughout Asia.By 2020, China’s cruise market is projected to grow to 4.5 million passengers, up from 1 million in 2015, per data from the Chinese Ministry of Transport. Also, by 2030, China is expected to become the world's second largest cruise market, after the United States.ConcernsCarnival intends to make additional investments this year as its brands have identified more revenue generating opportunities. Though these efforts are expected to benefit the company over the long run, these might weigh on near-term margins and earnings. Also, increased investments in advertising and TV programming are driving costs.Moreover, with a major portion of its revenues coming from Asia and Europe, the company is exposed to the impact of negative currency translation. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the functional currencies of the company’s foreign operations is also likely to impact results. Additionally, higher fuel prices are likely to impede earnings growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Royal Caribbean (RCL  -  Free Report), Cedar Fair, L.P. (FUN  -  Free Report) and Marcus Corporation (MCS  -  Free Report). All these stock carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

455,CCL,"Shares of Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report) increased 1% yesterday despite the Dow Jones, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq’s respective decline of 0.9%, 0.6% and 0.4%. This upside follows the company’s addition of shareholder value with a dividend hike. Carnival also approved the share repurchase program by another $1 billion.Notably, the cruise operator increased quarterly dividend by 11% to 50 cents per share. This is the fourth dividend hike since 2015. The increased dividend will be paid on Jun 15, 2018 to shareholders on record as of May 25. Prior to this, the company had been paying a quarterly dividend of 45 cents. The new payout amounts to an annual dividend of $2 per share and represents a yield of 3.1%. In November 2017, this Miami, FL-based company had increased its dividend by 12.5%.In fact, dividend hikes not only enhance shareholder returns but also raise the market value of the stock. Therefore, companies often tend to attract new investors and retain the old ones through this strategy.In case of Carnival, we believe that strong balance sheet and cash flows provide the company with financial flexibility to offer dividend hikes. It expects to generate $6 billion of cash from operations in 2018.Carnival exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $453 million, up from $395 million in the prior quarter. Cash from operations was around $1.06 billion.Stock PerformanceShares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 10.7% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s gain of 8.2%.Moreover, Carnival continues to introduce new flagships to form additional demand creation opportunities.
