But military hardware sales to Turkey are in question as Congress considers blocking the sale of the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 jet.The P-8 is a modified Boeing 737-800ERX, replacing Lockheed's P-3 Orion turboprop. The aircraft uses a high-power radar to scan for ships and submarines and a modified radar from the Boeing EA-18 Growler to scan for targets on land or near the coasts.Once a submarine is spotted, the aircraft can deploy sonobuoys to track and relay information about the location of hostile submarines. Or the plane can launch weapons like the Raytheon (RTN) Mark 54 Lightweight Hybrid Torpedo or Boeing's AGM-84D Harpoon anti-ship missile. Winged torpedoes with a GPS guidance system are in development.Demand for anti-submarine capabilities is rising as China has accelerated its submarine building, increasing tensions in the South China Sea. Russia used submarines to launch strikes in Syria and has increased submarine activity in Europe.But the P-8 also assists in search and rescue efforts. It was involved in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, MH370, in 2014 and Argentina's missing submarine in 2017.The body of the jet is built in Boeing's current 737 production line in Renton, but with some modifications like a thicker skin, stiffer wings and a bomb bay door. Then the jet is flown down the street to the P-8 facility near Boeing Field.There it gets militarized and completes final testing.

22,GPS,"SpyGate: Did the Obama administration spy on the Donald Trump campaign because it feared Russian hacking of the 2016 election? Or was it merely a smokescreen to cover up the real reason: to keep Trump from winning the presidency or take him down if he did?As the saying goes, timing is everything. Recent revelations keep pushing back the beginning of the CIA and FBI investigation into ""Russian hacking"" or ""meddling"" in the 2016 election further and further in time.This is significant, since the farther back in time the actual origin of the spying on Trump, the less likely it is that it had anything to do with Russian involvement in the 2016 elections, but everything to do with stopping the surprising surge of Trump during the GOP primaries and beyond.Increasingly, a political motive seems not only likely, but almost certain.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn a recent piece that warrants a thorough reading, Andrew C. McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney who now writes for the National Review, painstakingly dismantles the multiple lies told about how and when the spying on Trump began.There is what he calls ""The Original Origination Story"" that involves little-known Trump adviser Carter Page. He visited Moscow in July 2016, three months after hooking on to the Trump campaign.According to former MI6 British spy Christopher Steele's now infamous dossier on Trump, Page's trip was when the alleged Trump-Russia plan to hack the Democratic National Committee was born.The only problem is, the Steele dossier has been exposed as a fanciful product of the Clinton campaign and the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which hired Steele. And the main assertions were based on hearsay from Russian officials, and never validated.Even so, the FBI and Justice Department used the dossier to apply to the FISA court to tap Page's communications and, as a result, much of the rest of the Trump campaign.In doing so, the FBI broke its own rules and, worse, the Obama Justice Department withheld the fact from the FISA court that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee were responsible for the dossier.Then there was what McCarthy calls ""Origination Story 2.0.""This involves George Papadopoulos, a young, also little-known Trump aide. At a May 2016 meeting in a London pub, he told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer about an academic named Josef Mifsud with Kremlin ties who told Papadopoulos that the Kremlin had a huge number of emails that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton.Democrats point to this as proof that Trump had colluded to hack the DNC. But as McCarthy notes, there's a major flaw in that logic: ""If Russia already had the emails and was alerting the Trump campaign to that fact, the campaign could not have been involved in the hacking.""Moreover, Democrats insist Mifsud's comments about emails referred to the DNC emails that were, in fact, hacked by Russians.But that's not the case. Papadopoulos has said he thought Mifsud was talking about the more than 30,000 emails that Hillary Clinton ""accidentally"" had deleted from her illegal unsecured home email server.So if those didn't set up the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, what did?In fact, says McCarthy, the real origin of the investigation appears to have been in Spring of 2016, before Papadopoulos' conversation with the Australian ambassador in May and also before Page's visit to Moscow in July.It started with James Comey briefing President Obama's National Security Council about Carter Page, likely sometime in mid-Spring.Why? Well, both Page and Paul Manafort, another Trump adviser, had business ties to Russia, which, perhaps justifiably, concerned the FBI.But rather than telling the Trump campaign about their concerns, or even moving against the Russians, the Justice Department and the FBI starting treating Trump's campaign like a criminal enterprise.Instead of continuing to interview Page, or Manafort, or Papadopoulos, they inserted a spy, Stefan Halper, in the campaign, and tapped its phones. It had the earmarks of a political hit, not an actual investigation.As for the CIA, another line of inquiry finds they also were busy early on pursuing Trump.George Neumayr, writing in The American Spectator, notes that CIA Director John Brennan used the flimsy excuse of a tip from the Estonian intelligence agency that Putin was giving money to the Trump campaign to form an ""inter-agency taskforce"" on supposed Trump-Russia collusion in 2016. It met at CIA headquarters, spy central.The Estonian tip didn't pan out, but the task force remained.""Both before and after the FBI's official probe began in late July 2016,"" wrote Neumayr, ""Brennan was bringing together into the same room at CIA headquarters a cast of Trump haters across the Obama administration whose activities he could direct — from Peter Strzok, the FBI liaison to Brennan, to the doltish (Director of National Intelligence) Jim Clapper, Brennan's errand boy, to an assortment of Brennan's buddies at the Treasury Department, Justice Department, and White House.""It eventually led, on July 31, 2016, to the creation FBI's ""Crossfire Hurricane"" program to spy against the Trump campaign.What we're discovering is that the investigations and spying on the Trump campaign for evidence of possible collusion with Russia appear to have begun well before the CIA and FBI said they did.And it all arose from progressive, pro-Hillary embeds deep within the Deep State and at the top of key Obama agencies, people who could use their positions of supposed Olympian objectivity to mask their political bias — and to ignore years of evidence that Hillary Clinton had colluded with the Russians for her own financial benefit.As McCarthy concluded: ""The Trump-Russia investigation did not originate with Page or Papadopoulos. It originated with the Obama administration.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Russia Investigation: 3 Ways Democrats Confirmed GOP Claims Of AbuseRussia Scandal: Did Hillary Clinton Run FBI's Trump Investigation?Justice, FBI Russia-Trump Investigation Just Got Even More Corrupt — Why Does It Continue?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

He reaffirmed his buy rating and 45 price target.Gap shares fell 5% to 31.61 in the stock market today, falling further below their 50-day moving average, but off session lows of 30.75. Konik called the reaction ""overdone, given the Gap brand is only a small contribution to overall profitability.""""Old Navy remains the powerhouse of GPS in our view, and is well-positioned for continued share gains given its attractive price/value equation for consumers and off-mall real estate profile that helps insulate the concept from mall traffic declines,"" he wrote.Meanwhile, Guess co-founder Paul Marciano has agreed to give up his day-to-day duties at the company while Guess investigates sexual misconduct allegations brought against him by model Kate Upton.""I have pledged my full cooperation to the Company, and I have the utmost confidence in our CEO, Victor Herrero, to continue leading the Company during this time,"" said Marciano in a statement. The company said the same release that it ""takes very seriously any allegations of sexual misconduct."" Marciano has denied the allegations.On Feb. 9, Guess named a special committee to oversee the investigation.Guess shares sank 6.2% to 14.58, closing below their 200-day moving average. The stock plummeted nearly 18% on Feb. 1, slicing its 50-day line, after Upton first indicated via Twitter that Marciano had been inappropriate, nodding at the #MeToo movement.

25,GPS,"Shares of Garmin rallied after this week's earnings report, which saw the company make strides in the popular wearables market.First-quarter sales of $710.9 million increased 11% from a year ago as Garmin's (GRMN) outdoor and fitness markets saw sales jump 24% and 20%, respectively. That helped offset a 9% decline in the auto market, which includes navigation and video accessories. Earnings beat analysts' expectations.In the call with analysts Wednesday, CEO Clifton Pemble said strong demand for wearable devices drove gains. Those are devices that can track heart rates and other physical measurements. Wearables also describes watches for certain outdoor recreation activities such as jogging.In the outdoor market, the launch of the Descent watch for divers has been well-received.

Sales swelled 30%, also thanks largely to demand for wearables.Garmin is a leader in the consumer electronics industry group. It is largest by market cap among 11 companies in the group, at more than $12 billion. Its financial performance has improved. Earning growth accelerated 3%, 11% and 31% the past three quarters while sales climbed 3%, 3% and 11%.At Wednesday's earnings report, the company maintained its 2018 guidance for $3.2 billion in revenue and pro forma earnings of $3.05 a share.The stock jumped on the earnings news, but gave back much of that gain Thursday.The stock is forming a cup-type base with a buy point at 66.06. Most of the pattern has formed below the 50-day moving average, which is a weakness unless it can spend some weeks above the line before the breakout.Despite that Garmin is a leader in some technology fields, the stock has behaved more like an income stock. It's traded basically between 47 and 65 for nearly two years. Investors seeking yields certainly don't mind Garmin's dividend of $2.12 a share for the full year.

26,GPS,"Russia Investigation: We assume it was someone on Robert Mueller's Russia investigation team who leaked to the media a list of dozens of questions that he wants to ask President Trump. The only question is, why?More than four dozen questions were handed over to the New York Times that appear to be questions that Mueller delivered to Trump's lawyers to give the president an idea of what he would face.As the Times notes: ""The open-ended queries appear to be an attempt to penetrate the president's thinking, to get at the motivation behind some of his most combative Twitter posts and to examine his relationships with his family and his closest advisers. They deal chiefly with the president's high-profile firings of the FBI director and his first national security adviser, his treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and a 2016 Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton.""Whew. Quite a bit there. But please notice: Only one of the key topics mentioned involves the alleged Russian-Trump campaign collusion, which many  delusional Democrats insist denied Hillary Clinton the presidency. But that was supposedly the reason for the entire Russia investigation. What gives?Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt shows pretty conclusively that the Mueller investigation, which started out as an attempt to end Russian cyber-meddling in U.S. elections, has now become a fishing expedition — one whose sole purpose seems to be to catch the biggest fish of all, Donald Trump, for doing something, anything, that a special counsel could deem a criminal offense.It also shows desperation. As Thomas Gallatin of the Patriot Post notes, ""This is now the second time the Mueller team has leaked significant information to the press."" The first was in October, when Mueller's team leaked that it would charge several individuals in the investigation with crimes.Trump was, as usual, at his sarcastic best in tweeting a response: ""So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were 'leaked' to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see ... you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice! It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!""What could Mueller and his team be up to? Obviously, they want to keep the dying embers of the investigation alive by focusing on obstruction, rather than the original and entirely spurious allegation of collusion, a crime found nowhere in U.S. law.Famed Harvard legal scholar and trial attorney Alan Dershowitz said Mueller's list looks like it was intended as a trap for the loquacious Trump.""They are really designed to let him ramble and talk, and I suspect that's the strategy of the special counsel because they know that may be President Trump's weakness,"" Dershowitz said on CNN.It's pretty clear this has been a put-up job from the very beginning, with inside operators at both the Obama Justice Department and the Obama FBI assiduously protecting Hillary Clinton from charges for her violations of U.S. law with her unsecured email server, while launching a sleazy internal investigation and counteraction against Donald Trump funded by Democratic operatives and left-wing billionaires.As we've said before, it all has the stink of a Banana Republic to it, the kind of place where the rule of law no longer matters. Venezuela on the Potomac.That could be seen in last week's revelation that the Fusion GPS investigation of Trump, largely based on the ""Trump dossier"" assembled by former British spy Christopher Steele and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee, didn't end after the election. In fact, as the Daily Caller's Chuck Ross reported, ""A group of wealthy donors from New York and California have forked out $50 million to fund a Russia investigation being conducted by Christopher Steele, Fusion GPS and a former staffer for Dianne Feinstein.""That devastating bit of news came from the House Intelligence Committee's recently released report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race.So what is one to make of all this? Clearly, there is a long-standing effort among the Hillary Clinton Democrats and their wealthy progressive allies to sabotage Trump's presidency and to bring a never-ending investigation of all his various affairs, both business and personal.This effort does not come from the highest motives. It is a base effort to overturn the legitimate results of a national presidential election through a nonstop media campaign coupled with continuing investigations on multiple fronts to find something with which to delegitimize Trump and eventually remove him from office. It's about power, not ideals.It is, in short, a kind of bloodless political coup, acted out in slow motion. Its intent is to disenfranchise an entire nation and to cause a permanent, irreparable political split that will lead to turmoil and perhaps even violence.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Russia Scandal: Will Devin Nunes Investigation Prove 'Deep State' Collusion By FBI, DOJ?FBI Scandal: Deep State Corruption Of FBI, Justice Was There From Very Start Of Hillary Email ProbeWhy No Investigation Into FBI, Justice Dept.

27,GPS,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes. He says future inventors will use both the science and the fiction of the past to inspire smart clothing designs.""I think a lot of our movies in the past got the future pretty right. Even with 'Back To The Future,' Nike released self-tying sneakers so that became a reality,"" Clinton said. ""In lots of ways fiction and entertainment inspire entrepreneurs to create the products they think are really cool when they see movies as kids.""As the next generation thinks about what they can build on top of these products, innovation will just compound.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.2 million barrels vs. the drop analysts expected. Domestic production rose to 10.59 million barrels per day, a 46,000 barrel increase. U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $69 a barrel, the highest level since late 2014, but traded little changed for the week.General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) beat quarterly estimates. Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints. Sales of Alexion's blockbuster Soliris missed some estimates, but shares popped on a promising study for new drug ALXN1210. Biogen (BIIB) sales lagged on sluggish Spinraza and multiple sclerosis drug revenue. Prothena (PRTA) tanked 69% on Monday after it scrapped a rare disease drug on a failed Phase 2 study. Eli Lilly (LLY) broadly beat the consensus. Two diabetes drugs and a chemotherapy helped offset short sales of psoriasis drug Taltz. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) sales and adjusted profit lagged. AbbVie (ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) both topped profit views and raised full-year guidance, though Bristol's sales missed some estimates. Shire (SHPG) said it's considering a raised $64 billion takeover bid by Japan's Takeda. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) topped views, though sales declined vs. last year. Vertex said it'll move another triple-pill regimen into Phase 3 studies.Domino's (DPZ) delivered a 59% EPS gain while revenue leapt 26% to $785 million, blowing out views. Shares rose 7.3% on Thursday. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock vaulted 24% to a 10-month high after EPS unexpectedly jumped 33%. Same-store sales also topped. Starbucks (SBUX) was on par on earnings with an 18% EPS rise to 53 cents, though a 14% rise on sales to $6.03 billion outdid analyst predictions.New Oriental Education (EDU) earned 67 cents per share as revenue grew to $618 million. Total student enrollments rose 7.7% year over year to about 861,400. IBD 50 stock TAL Education's (TAL) EPS jumped to 14 cents a share as revenue soared 59% to $504 million. Student enrollments ballooned 96% vs. a year earlier to 2.62 million. New Oriental and TAL shares popped on their respective earnings days, but were slightly lower for the week intraday Friday.PulteGroup (PHM) on Tuesday crushed views with a 111% EPS jump to 59 cents, with home sale revenue leaping 21% to $1.9 billion. Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates. Fifty-two customers now spend over $5 million annually, a metric that is up 108% year over year.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) topped sales and adjusted profit views, but shares tanked as sales of transcatheter heart valve replacements lagged.Illumina (ILMN) beat the consensus. Adjusted profit rose 127% per share as sales swelled 31% to $782 million.Align Technology (ALGN) reported adjusted earnings of $1.17 per share and $436.9 million in revenue, handily beating views for 98 cents and $408 million, respectively.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) delivered impressive Q1 EPS and revenue growth, but fell short of some lofty expectations. Shares fell 4.7% for the week. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) continues to rise after last week's strong results.First Solar (FSLR) hit a six-year high after Q1 earnings topped expectations due to the sale of several solar projects, as it expanded U.S. production.Proofpoint (PFPT), a cybersecurity firm, topped adjusted first-quarter earnings and revenue views, but guided low on Q2 profit. Shares fell 5.2% Friday. In Q1, advanced protection solutions nearly doubled to make up 20% of new and add-on bookings, up from 15% in the prior quarter.

35,GPS,"Russia Scandal: The Democrats' quixotic lawsuit against the Republicans, Russia and WikiLeaks smells like desperation. Is the Democratic Party's ties to its own far-left progressive base really so frayed that it has to resort to farcical legal maneuvers? Apparently so.As any reasonably objective legal expert will tell you, the Democrats' law suit is a mish-mash of finger-pointing and blame backed by virtually no evidence. It asserts a conspiracy of the Republicans, Russians and WikiLeaks to get Donald Trump elected president during the 2016 campaign.Yes, they expect people to believe it.In that respect, it  is a pitiful echo of the Russian investigation launched by the Democrats and ""Never Trumpers"" in Congress to look into allegations of ""collusion"" — which is nowhere, by the way, defined as a crime in the U.S. legal code — between the Trump campaign and Russia.That investigation, headed by Robert Mueller, has netted so far exactly zero public evidence of collusion — even as we near the two-year anniversary of the ongoing investigation.As we've said in this space many times before, the entire Russia investigation had nothing to do with keeping American elections safe from Russian influence, but everything to do with Democrats' scapegoating after losing what for them should have been one of the most winnable elections in recent decades.That Donald Trump, erstwhile real estate magnate, playboy and reality TV star, should have bested the person that many Democrats laughably called ""the most qualified person ever"" for the presidency, shows just how out of touch they are with common Americans.Given that the overwhelming balance of evidence available today suggests that the Democrats, not the Republicans, have colluded with the Russians, this lawsuit is rich in irony. It hasn't escaped notice by others, in particular Republicans.""This is about the extreme left, the socialist left, wanting to never accept that the president of the United States was rightfully and duly elected, carried a number of states that nobody expected him to carry,"" said Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ""So this is a fundraising scheme. It's nothing more, nothing less. It's a fundraising scheme because the Democrats are out of money, and that's what this is about.""President Trump called the DNC lawsuit ""good news"" since it would give him a chance to use the Dems' own suit to get answers about ""the DNC Server that they (Democrats) refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.""Apart from the political tit-for-tat, the Dems' suit is something else: a cover up of Hillary Clinton's massive failure as a candidate, not once but twice. Democrats have been hypnotized by the oft-repeated idea that Clinton is ""inevitable"" as America's first woman president.The American people went to the polls and voted otherwise. And today, a year and a half after that epic election, polls show that Clinton remains a deeply polarizing political figure with high negatives among much of the voting public.A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found Clinton's favorability has plunged since losing in November of 2016, with only 27% having a favorable view of her. Yes, she's lower than Trump, at 35%..And Hillary Clinton steadfastly refuses to even admit that she was rejected, instead opting for increasingly bizarre and paranoid scenarios for why she didn't win — none of them, of course, having to do with her lack of likability and basing her campaign on a far-left political agenda.The fact is, the Democratic Party should be cruising to a victory this year in the House, with some expecting as many as 40 Republican seats to change hands. But that's not a reflection of the Democrats' competence or compelling message. No, it's common in mid-term elections of during a presidency for there to be a big swing. This year is no different.Moreover, the GOP-led Congress, while it did deliver on tax cuts as promised, has failed on a number of other initiatives, in particular its pledge to repeal ObamaCare and to restore effective control over immigration and the border.It's no secret that the Democrats under DNC Chairman Tom Perez have come up short on raising money. While unhappy with Republicans' failure to deliver on all their promises, voters don't seem particularly enamored with the Democrats, either.""Overall, the RNC has raised $171.6 million in the 2018 campaign cycle, where it is expected to pour money into Senate contests against Democratic incumbents and on behalf of Republican House members as Democrats look to retake the chamber in November,"" the Washington Examiner reported recently.While the DNC hasn't yet said what it's raised in March, by the end of February it had just $10 million in cash and was $6 million in debt.They do have a lead in generic preference polls, but that could melt like a snowflake in Death Valley if the public thinks the party's policies are inadequate or too far left. So far, the Democrats seem eager to help the GOP, issuing one of the most extreme, far-left policy papers in the history of mainstream American politics just last weekend. Good luck, Donkey Party.So, yes, this lawsuit is an act of desperation. They hope to get their most ardent supporters whipped up for the mid-term elections, to retake the house and possibly even the Senate. In that, they face an uphill battle.But they also hope to use this lawsuit ju-jitsu to turn Hillary Clinton into a victim of Trump and the Russians, which is the exact opposite of the truth. She and her party spent the eight years of the Obama presidency pushing reset buttons, appeasing and, yes, colluding with the Russians on everything from the civil wars in Libya and Syria to the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine to Hillary's decision to allow the a Russian state-controlled company to own 20% of the U.S. uranium supply.In the meantime, a number of dangers stare the Democrats in the face, including the ongoing investigation into the Hillary Clinton email caper and a complaint filed last year with the Federal Election Commission.The  latter alleges that the Clinton campaign paid for the phony Trump dossier created by Fusion GPS with 37 payments totaling $5.5 million, made through the law firm Perkins Coie. Those payments for the dossier, which was later used to launch extensive FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign team, were illegally classified as ""legal services."" The DNC, likewise, made 345 payments to Perkins Coie during the 2016 election cycle.The point is, the actual evidence points to massive collusion and voter fraud on the part of the Clinton campaign. With their bogus lawsuit, the Democrats are running a national campaign to gaslight  Americans into believing that what they know to be true really isn't. They are desperately trying to push the ""reset button"" on their own failure in 2016. It isn't working.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Russia Scandal: Did Hillary Clinton Run FBI's Trump Investigation?Russia Investigation: 3 Ways Democrats Confirmed GOP Claims Of AbuseRussia Scandal: Will Devin Nunes Investigation Prove 'Deep State' Collusion By FBI, DOJ?

37,GPS,"As the likelihood that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia seems headed toward zero, the likelihood of proof of a different form of collusion seems headed upward toward certainty.The Russia collusion charge had some initial credibility because of businessman Donald Trump's dealings in Russia and candidate Trump's off-putting praise of Vladimir Putin.It was fueled by breathless media coverage of such trivial events as Jeff Sessions' conversation with the Russian ambassador at a Washington reception — and, of course, by the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel. But Mueller's prosecutions of Trump campaign operatives were for misdeeds long before the campaign, and his indictment of 13 Russians specified that no American was a ""knowing participant"" in their work.Now there's talk that Mueller is winding up his investigation. It seems unlikely that whatever he reports will fulfill the daydreams so many liberals have of making Trump go the way of Richard Nixon.Meanwhile, the evidence builds of collusion by Obama administration law enforcement and intelligence personnel in trying to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat and delegitimize Trump in and after the 2016 election.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe investigation of Clinton's illegal email system was conducted with kid gloves. FBI Director James Comey accepted Attorney General Loretta Lynch's order to call it a ""matter"" rather than an ""investigation."" Clinton aides were allowed to keep her emails and destroy 30,000 of them, plus cellphones. They were not subject to grand jury subpoenas, and a potential co-defendant was allowed to claim attorney-client privilege.On June 27, 2016, Lynch clandestinely met with Bill Clinton on his plane at the Phoenix airport — a meeting that became known only thanks to an alert local TV reporter. Lynch supposedly left the decision on prosecution to Comey, who on July 5 announced publicly that Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" but lacked intent to violate the law, even though the statute punishes such violations whether they are intentional or not.Contrast that with the collusion of Obama officials with the Clinton campaign-financed Christophe Steele/Fusion GPS dossier alleging Trump ties with Russians. Comey and the Justice Department used it, without divulging who paid for it, to get a FISA warrant to surveil former Trump campaign operative Carter Page's future and past communications — the ""wiretap"" Trump was derided for mentioning.Similarly, when Comey informed Trump in January 2017 of the contents of the then-unpublished Steele dossier, he didn't reveal that the Clinton campaign had paid for it. Asked on his iatrogenic book tour why not, he blandly said he didn't know. And maybe he doesn't actually realize he was employing J. Edgar Hoover-like tactics to keep his job. Maybe.In any case, after he was fired, he immediately sent four of his internal memos, at least one of them classified, to a law professor friend to leak them to the press, with the intent of getting a special counsel appointed — who turned out to be his longtime friend and ally Robert Mueller. Collusion, anyone?Collusion can get complicated and sometimes fails to produce the intended results. Comey's deputy FBI director, Andrew McCabe, reportedly kept to himself for weeks the discovery that Clinton emails had been transmitted over the home computer of her aide Huma Abedin's then-husband, the disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner. After Comey learned of this, he made his Oct. 28 announcement that the Clinton email investigation was being reopened.Comey and McCabe have produced contradictory accounts of events, and Comey's public praise of McCabe contrasts with his referral of McCabe to Justice's inspector general, who found him guilty of ""lack of candor"" — a fireable offense for which he was indeed fired. Partners in collusion sometimes fall out.Longtime Clinton friend Lanny Davis charges that Comey's statement was responsible for Clinton's defeat, and Comey, on his book tour, admitted that he may have made it only because he assumed Clinton would win.Davis may be right, though no one can prove it. But one could also say that the Democratic Party lost the presidency because it nominated a candidate under investigation for committing a felony. And it seems as certain as these things can be that if Hillary Clinton had followed the law and regulations, there would be today no President Trump, no Attorney General Sessions, no EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, no Justice Neil Gorsuch.The blame ultimately belongs to Barack Obama, who knew of Clinton's private email system and who could have ordered her to follow the law. But that's one bit of collusion that didn't occur.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Russia Scandal: Will Devin Nunes Investigation Prove 'Deep State' Collusion By FBI, DOJ?Think Obama Administration Wasn't Corrupt?

38,GPS,"Clinton Scandal: After months of fruitless investigations of the supposed ""collusion"" between the Trump campaign and Russia, 11 fed-up congressional Republicans have said ""enough."" They want an investigation of the Democrats' collusion with top Justice Department officials and the FBI to ruin Trump in the 2016 election, and after. Get ready for a legal donnybrook.The 11 sent a letter on Wednesday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions seeking criminal investigations of those for whom there's actual evidence of a crime, among them former FBI Director James Comey, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and high-level FBI operatives Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.But this isn't the only iron in the fire, right now.Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has quietly been investigating the entire mare's nest of collusion, lies and political machinations by those surrounding both former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It's now bearing fruit.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNo sooner had the congressional letter landed in Sessions' office than it was revealed late Thursday that Horowitz has already referred McCabe to the U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C. for criminal charges.He's also investigating the FBI's actions during the 2016 presidential campaign, and collusion with the State Department. The next report is due as early as next month.So the criminal cascade of the Democrats' plan to subvert Trump's campaign is beginning. It all started with Hillary Clinton's machinations to win the presidency and discredit Trump with a phony ""dossier"" ginned up by former British spy Christopher Steele, but paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.That dossier was in part used as a pretense for the FBI to spy on the Trump campaign. In effect, the Obama FBI and Justice Department became adjuncts of the Hillary for President campaign. Don't bother looking it up: It's illegal.If McCabe is the first, will Hillary Clinton be next? Or will she avoid charges entirely? After months of denial and obfuscation by Hillary, the FBI, Justice and the former Obama administration, the truth may finally be known. Let's hope so.The congressional letter seeking an official investigation lists a number of ""potential violations of federal statutes"" by former high-level Obama administration appointees.If you read IBD regularly, most of them are pretty well known.They include Comey's botched handling of the Clinton email scandal and leaking of classified information, Clinton's ""disguising payments to Fusion GPS on mandatory disclosures to the Federal Election Commission,"" Lynch's threatening retaliation against a former FBI informant who came forward with information on the Uranium One Deal and McCabe's multiple lies under oath.Also, ""With regard to top counterintelligence FBI agent, Peter Strzok, and senior FBI lawyer Lisa Page, we raise concerns regarding their interference in the Hillary Clinton investigation regarding her use of a personal email server,"" the letter from the congressional 11 said.Any of these, if true, would warrant prosecution.Is this the skeleton key that opens the closet of the Deep State's secrets?The investigation of the Clinton email scandal is of particular interest. It ties together many of the high-powered  people mentioned in the congressional letter.  All of them, it appears, colluded to help Hillary win in 2016 — or, at minimum, to keep Trump from winning. It's a distinction without a difference.Despite reams of evidence, Hillary Clinton has so far skated when it comes to the public investigations of her behavior during the email scandal, the Uranium One scandal, the Benghazi scandal, the Clinton Foundation scandal, and so much else.In effect, Horowitz is doing the job that the Robert Mueller Russian collusion investigation should have been doing from the very start.No doubt, Democrats, Hillary partisans and Never Trumpers will scream that this is all a political witch hunt. It isn't. The evidence is growing that serious crimes were committed by Justice Department and FBI officials seemingly acting in silent collusion with the Clinton campaign.If so, it dwarfs the Watergate scandal in magnitude, and warrants prison terms — not mere slaps on the wrist.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Why No Investigation Into FBI, Justice Dept.

In 2015, it was estimated at $12 billion when Alphabet (GOOGL) and Fidelity Investments invested $1 billion, taking a combined 10% stake.SpaceX is in the midst of a rapid acceleration in the pace of its operations.

41,GPS,"Under Armour (UAA) had a crummy 2017 as the stock lost half its value. Shares have been showing some signs of life in recent weeks, retaking both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. But Under Armour's status as a cool-kid brand isn't doing so hot, particularly with women and teens.B.

That is a ""double negative"" for the brand, since the survey also found that a higher number of women plan to do more shopping for athletic clothes and shoes this year.(Nike has its own problem with women at the moment, and an internal Nike human resources memo, obtained by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, said that the company needs to do better to represent women and people of color at higher levels of the company.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

As a running and casual shoe brand, Under Armour ""dropped significantly"" in the poll, sliding to sixth place from third, which Anderson attributes to Under Armour's lack of casual and retro footwear options.Separately, Susquehanna's Sam Poser reviewed a number of Under Armour's 10-K filings and said Wednesday that he believes that its international business may be growing fast but is ""heading down a similar path as North America given optimistic targets (which were missed in 4Q17), elevated inventory and deteriorating margins.""Poser called Under Armour's brand and inventory position ""precarious."" Trying to sell athletic shoes and clothes in the U.S. and Canada has been a tough business in recent years, and Nike has spent some time tightening its supply to match demand as it sees a reversal of its fortunes in North America.Both Anderson and Poser said Under Armour is losing shelf space at retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS).Under Armour shares fell 2.35% to finish at 17.47 in the stock market today, but are still up sharply this week.

47,GPS,"See if this sounds familiar: Democratic presidential campaign pays international law firm Perkins Coie, which then turns around and pays left-wing opposition research firm Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on the campaign's political opponent.Sounds just like what Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee did in 2016, right?In fact, Hillary was a Janey-come-lately to that ploy. Obama did it first in 2012. Using his Obama for America campaign front, Obama paid Perkins Coie close to a million dollars, which was reportedly used to pay — who else — Fusion GPS to find salacious stuff about Obama's foe in the 2012 election, the ultra-square Mitt Romney.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut, according to a new book by progressive journalists Michael Isikoff and David Corn, ""Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and Donald Trump's Election,"" not only did Fusion do opposition research, something every campaign does, it also did aggressively hostile opposition donor research.""In 2012, then-President Obama had an 'enemies list' on his campaign website with the names of Mitt Romney's biggest donors,"" noted PJ Media's Debra Heine.That enemies list was placed on the Obama campaign's Orwellian ""Truth Team"" web site. The site called them a ""group of wealthy individuals with less-than-reputable records. Quite a few have been on the wrong side of the law, others have made profits at the expense of so many Americans...""That kind of vilification of decent, law-abiding, successful Americans is bad enough. But to drive home the intimidation, each of the names on the list was subsequently tweeted out from the @TruthTeam2012 twitter feed, along with their supposed misdeeds, most of which really amounted merely to tough or unpopular business decisions they had to make.Obama ""relied on a vast grassroots network to coerce, bully, boycott and vilify individuals lawfully taking part in the political process, just as his own donors and supporter are freely allowed to engage,"" wrote the Daily Signal back in 2012.Imagine for a moment the chilling effect that would have on a political foe's campaign — calling those who fund another campaign's candidate ""enemies,"" with all that entails. The IRS, the SEC, the FBI, the Justice Department, all with active prosecution arms, all headed by Obama loyalists. To say it's an act of political and personal intimidation is an understatement.Obama's fingerprints go beyond that, however.The Isikoff-Corn book suggests that the infamous relationship between former British spy Christopher Steele, Fusion GPS and the FBI  was forged by Obama officials at the State Department — in particular former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, who gave permission to the FBI to talk to Steele in London, and former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jonathan Winer, who ""worked as a middleman to bring Mr. Steele together with Sidney Blumenthal, a fierce Hillary Clinton defender. Mr. Winer spoke with Ms. Nuland, who gave a heads up to Secretary of State John Kerry.""How much do you want to bet that Kerry, a cabinet member, reported all this to former President Obama?By the way, both Nuland and Winer worked for Clinton at the State Department, and both have since left. And the notorious Trump dossier that resulted from putting Steele together with the FBI, Fusion and the Clinton campaign led to a wiretap of the Trump campaign and also now serves as the centerpiece of a year-and-a-half long Mueller investigation into Trump — one that has now spilled over its boundaries, looking into things that have nothing to do with Russian meddling in the 2016 election.The genius of it all is that, at the same time they were using spurious Russian contacts to smear Trump's name, they were also launching the FBI investigation into phony allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians in 2016. The only collusion, in short, was between the Clinton campaign, Steele and the Russians.But what we now see clearly is this entire scheme wasn't just cooked up by a Nixonian Hillary Clinton, trying her best to destroy her political foe. No, it was part of a pattern set by President Obama and copied by his able student, Hillary. The Obama-adoring media knew what Obama had done in 2012, but barely bothered to report at the time.This goes beyond mere creepy political collusion, or dirty campaign capers. It suggests a broader Democratic scheme to use government resources to hamstring opposition political campaigns and, now, to destroy a presidency.And this conspiracy spans two presidential campaign cycles and two separate opposition presidential candidates, using remarkably similar tactics and even the same law firm and research operation. With a number of government officials knowingly involved, this, in short, reeks of conspiracy to subvert the election process.You Might Also Like:Will Mueller Ever Admit That There Was No Trump-Russia Collusion?Russia-Trump Investigation: How Did Hillary Clinton Get FBI, FISA To Do Her Political Dirty Work?Why No Investigation Into FBI, Justice Dept.

48,GPS,"Cold War 2.0? To anyone with any sense, it's now painfully obvious that Russian strongman Vladimir Putin isn't merely a pest, but a menace. His government's recent nerve gas attacks on former Russian citizens in Britain and threats over Syria underscore a growing threat.For years, Democrats in the U.S. have refused to take the old USSR or Putin and the ""New Russia"" seriously. From the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's treasonous overture to the former Soviet Union to help undercut and defeat Ronald Reagan, to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's inane ""reset button,"" to President Obama signaling he would be ready to roll over for Russia by telling then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have ""more flexibility"" in dealing with Russia after winning the 2012 election, the donkey party has been an ever-eager appeaser.That is, until recently. Having lost an election, they've tried to sell the idea that it wasn't really their bad policies or unappealing candidates to blame, but rather Russian meddling in the 2016 election. They finagled an investigation into the idea that Donald Trump ""colluded"" with the Russians to get elected — an investigation that, now a year and a half old, looks to be going off the rails.But at least the Democrats could finally say they're tough on Putin.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWell, we'll see. Because following the Russian poisonings of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Britain (Sergei was a former British mole in Russian intelligence) with the Russian nerve-agent Novichok, and the expulsion by British Prime Minister Theresa May of 23 Russian ""diplomats"" in London and the suspension of high-level contacts with Russia, the old Cold War we all thought was over in 1990 may be on again.Former National Security Agency analyst John R. Schindler of the XX Committee website calls it ""Cold War 2.0,"" which he says began four years ago with Russia's seizure of the Crimea.""The greatest concern for the West ought to be the reality that the Putin regime does not feel constrained by the 'Moscow Rules' of the last Cold War,"" Schindler wrote this week in the Observer.The U.S. showed it wasn't going to wait for the same treatment. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley issued an explicit warning this week that Putin might try to use chemical weapons, say, in New York City.""If we don't take immediate concrete measures to address this now, Salisbury (where the attacks took place) will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used,"" she told the U.N. Security Council. She called it a ""defining moment.""But she put it into a much bigger context. Putin has allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad, using chemical weapons to attack Assad's many fundamentalist Islamic enemies, none of whom are very nice people. Still, there are rules and conventions that have been broken — rules and conventions that, frankly, help keep the world from descending into a long, deep twilight of chaos and violence.""Russia failed to ensure Syria destroyed its chemical weapons program,"" Haley noted. ""Russia killed the joint investigative mechanism when it found Assad liable for chemical attacks. Russia used its veto to shield Assad five times last year.""One lesson that the world has learned over and over is that a bully, once emboldened by weakness, doesn't stop — he doubles down on the bullying. Extraterritorial assassinations are minor compared with the mayhem of military-strength chemical attacks, which indiscriminately kill terrorists and innocents alike. Putin is capable of both, and has nuclear weapons.Whether it's conducting chemical warfare in Syria, fomenting trouble in Ukraine, or taking back the Crimea, Putin seems intent on restoring the fallen Soviet Union's lost glory by putting as many pieces of the old empire back together.""Don't waste your time on campaign speeches to discern Putin's direction,"" the American Enterprise Institute's director of Russian studies, Leon Aron, wrote in February. Instead, he said, look at Russia's $324 billion arms program for 2018-27, nearly a third of Russia's entire budget, revealed during a recent four-day conference.""The program's goal, Putin said ... was the 'efficient neutralization' of external threats,"" Aron noted. ""He concluded the meeting by calling on all Russian large enterprises, whether state-owned or private, to be able to 'rapidly increase defense-related production and services at a time of need.' ""So this isn't just about poisoning spies. It's about power. It's about making Russia a player again. It's about maneuvering and intimidation.In response, the U.S., France, Germany and U.K. issued a joint statement condemning the attacks.""This use of a military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, constitutes the first offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War,"" the leaders said. ""It is an assault on U.K. sovereignty, and any such use by a state party is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law. It threatens the security of us all.""Meanwhile, President Trump is playing hardball. As the Associated Press reports, ""the Trump administration accused Moscow on Thursday of a concerted hacking operation targeting the U.S. energy grid, aviation systems and other infrastructure, and also imposed sanctions on Russians for alleged interference in the 2016 election.""""These targeted sanctions are a part of a broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.In all, 19 Russians have been hit with sanctions, along with at least five Russian companies, AP reports, ""including the Internet Research Agency, which is accused of orchestrating a mass online disinformation campaign to affect the presidential election result.""So Trump is ratcheting up the pressure on Putin. Maybe NATO should get in on this.Democrats have claimed Trump is ""soft"" on Russia, which is a joke. Even Trump's energy policy, hysterically opposed by the Democrats, has been a disaster for Putin. But now the question is, will the Democrats, who have used their ""resistance"" as a reason for not cooperating with Trump on anything, support these reasonable steps he is taking to push back against Russia? Will they support him when he goes even further to protect Americans from Putin?Or will they revert to their old form when it comes to Russia — appeasement?YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Obama Administration, Hillary Clinton Covered Up Their Deep, Corrupt Ties To RussiaFusion GPS' 'Fake Investigation' — And Hillary Clinton's Real Russian CollusionSenate Investigates Russia, Hillary Clinton, Obama, Uranium And Bribes — And It's About TimeClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

49,GPS,"Russia Scandal: Former high-level Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, a key cog in the Russia-Trump investigation, didn't let his employer know that his wife was being paid by Fusion GPS, the company that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee paid to dig up dirt on Trump. Nor did he seek a waiver for a possible conflict of interest. What is wrong with this investigation?XIt's yet another indication of rot at the very core of this corrupt investigation whose only real aim has ever been to unseat Trump as president.As the Daily Caller reports, ""The (DNC) ...hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the 'dossier.' Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe media and progressives sneer at the idea of a ""deep state."" But if anything shows its nefariousness, this would be it. At minimum, it appears that Fusion GPS cynically hired Bruce Ohr's wife in order to get access to him and, by extension, to influence the U.S. justice system on behalf of its client, Hillary Clinton.The Justice Department used the tainted information to get a wiretap on a Trump adviser, Carter Page. But it failed to tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that the information came from Trump's 2016 presidential campaign opponent and the Democratic Party, and that they had paid for it.He also continued to meet with former British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Trump Dossier, even after he was fired by the FBI for feeding the media with information from the investigation. The House Intelligence Committee memo released recently quoted Steele as telling Ohr he was ""was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.""These are criminal acts, and provable ones. Ohr lied about his wife's employment. And the Justice Department lied by omission in its application to spy on the Trump campaign. Moreover, Justice and the FBI used what they knew was tainted information to gain a wiretap warrant.Quite simply, these are the tactics of a police state, not a republic where citizens have due process rights.But Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie aren't the only ones. The corruption reaches far deeper, to what American Thinker writer Monica Showalter calls ""Deep State tag-teams"" of inside-the-beltway bureaucratic power couples that used their positions of power for personal gain or political advantage.""This shows the incestuousness of the Deep State, of course,"" Showalter, a former IBD staffer, wrote. ""First, FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe and his wife, then FBI counterintelligence big Peter Strzok and his mistress Lisa page, and now Bruce and Nellie Ohr. ""And what did they all have in common? ""Not a one of them was afraid of the consequences that ordinarily come of blatant conflicts of interest, and some, apparently such as Bruce Ohr, felt they could get away easily with lying.""As we said, the rot at the very center of this investigation gets worse by the week. Despite Robert Mueller's silence, his investigation is now so hopelessly compromised by its political bias and its clear anti-Trump motivation, it should not go on any longer.No American who respects due process and basic constitutional rights can view the results of the Russia-Trump investigation as anything but a thinly veiled political hit job.

50,GPS,"In a New York Times op-ed on Wednesday titled ""The Republicans' Fake Investigations,"" the two founders of Fusion GPS desperately try to clear their names, restore their business' tarnished reputation and revive their sordid Russia collusion tale about Trump to ""correct the record."" They fail on all counts.In their piece, journalists-turned-political investigators Glenn R. Simpson and Peter Fritsch made some interesting assertions about Trump and his supposed collusion with the Russians. But once again, they give no proof for what they call their ""intelligence reports.""X Someone forgot to tell the investigative duo: Intelligence without proof is merely gossip. And that's exactly what they've sold.But what Simpson and Fritsch did do in their defense of Fusion GPS' actions was to confirm the worst fears about the real collusion that took place among the Democrats, Fusion and the Russians.In case you don't remember all the twists and turns of the tale, Fusion was hired in the summer of 2016 to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald Trump. It did so by hiring a former top British spy in Russia, Christopher Steele, whose murky Russian government and espionage ties and even-deeper connections to the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies made him the perfect source.Steele produced 35 pages of  salacious allegations against Trump — including that he cavorted with Russian prostitutes in a bed once used by Barack Obama; that he was offered bribes of more than a billion dollars by the Russian state-controlled oil giant Rosneft to end U.S. trade sanctions on Russia if he won the presidency; and that Trump officials secretly met with Russian officials to collude on ""hacking"" the Democrats during the 2016 election.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveExcept there's no evidence outside of the so-called Steele Dossier to prove any of this. Indeed, after more than 18 months, the Comey-Mueller FBI investigations of alleged Trump collusion with Russia have come up bone dry.It's important to note that the Fusion founders in their op-ed did confirm things that earlier had been reported: Namely, that the anti-Trump research was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, as first reported by the Washington Post on October 24 and subsequently confirmed by Fox News and CNN.As the Post said, ""Marc E. Elias, a lawyer representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, retained Fusion GPS, a Washington firm, to conduct the research ... Elias and his law firm, Perkins Coie, retained the company in April 2016 on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC.""Indeed, the DNC paid for the research all the way until the very end of October, merely days before the election. Fusion GPS delivered Steele's reports and other research to Elias, for use by the Democrats.This is important because as we're now finding out, part of the dossier was also used by the FBI to convince a FISA court to let the FBI spy on Trump campaign officials. So there's a real conflict here: A dossier paid for by one political party and its candidate being used by the government to spy on that candidate's opponent.Yet, Simpson and Fritsch are coy on this and so many other things.They say, for instance, that it was Steele, not they, who gave the information to the FBI. But of course they would say that. How else could they convince future ""clients"" that they wouldn't leak the information they dug up to the government or anyone else?What's more, the dossier was promiscuously shared among reporters and Democratic officials, so much so that it seemed to be an all-but-open secret. They can say Steele, a foreigner, did it, but it was inevitable that the dossier would end up in the hands of the FBI, whose anti-Trump, pro-Clinton director was James Comey.They also go on to write that ""Mr. Steele's sources in Russia (who were not paid) reported on an extensive — and now confirmed — effort by the Kremlin to help elect Mr. Trump president.""First off, as the Washington Times' Rowan Scarborough has reported, some Russian sources were paid. As far as we know, that has never been disproven. And most of  the dossier's ""sources"" — spies and government officials — worked for or previously worked for the Kremlin. That is, Vladimir Putin.Steele himself in the dossier describes those he talked with as  ""a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure,"" ""a senior Russian government official,"" a one-time ""top level Russian intelligence officer active inside the Kremlin,"" and a ""senior Kremlin official.""Aren't these the people Fusion says Trump is colluding with? Why would they say anything?What's more, as we've noted before, it was the Democrats and Hillary Clinton, not Trump, who made use of the information in the Steele Dossier during the campaign, information provided by Russian government officials. So who's really colluding here?The dossier is a mess of unverified charges of criminality against Trump officials, including that they helped coordinate the hacking of Democratic Party computers by the Russian government.Yet, once again in the op-ed, there is no proof given for any of the dossier's most serious assertions of criminal acts. We're supposed to take their word for it. Or rather, Russian government officials' word.It would take a book to dispel all of the half-truths and distortions of Simpson and Fritsch — not to mention the omissions.One major example of the latter: They don't mention meeting with high-level Justice Department official Bruce Ohr during the election campaign, or that Ohr also met with Christopher Steele. Or that Fusion GPS hired Bruce Ohr's  CIA-connected wife, Nellie, to do some digging for them. The obvious conflicts here are just staggering. But Simpson and Fritsch say nothing about it.What's increasingly apparent is that the Robert Mueller investigation, which was kickstarted in 2016 by the Trump Dossier, has turned into a continuation of the Democrats' failed 2016 political campaign against Trump, with vague insinuations of misconduct or outright criminality but never any proof.Maybe proof isn't the idea at all. Rather it's about finding a way to hobble a highly effective conservative president who seems dead set on changing Washington for good and for the better. Talk about a real threat to the progressive Democrats and their allies in the Deep State.RELATED:Deep State Run Amok?

53,GPS,"The American public's first sign that space warfare is being waged won't be giant explosions lighting up the sky or X-Wing fighters crashing to the ground. Instead, everyday conveniences that we take for granted would be disrupted, such as ATMs and streaming videos.X But the world's most powerful military could be crippled if an enemy destroyed or disabled critical space infrastructure as part of a space war. Navigation, guided missiles and missile-warning alerts rely on GPS satellites. Critical intelligence comes from spy satellites. Drones, Navy ships and infantry grunts use communications satellites. And the disruption of your mundane comforts, which increasingly rely on satellite communications, eventually could grind daily life to a halt.""Our entire global economy and our way of life (are) enabled by space capabilities,"" said Col. Shawn Fairhurst, deputy director at Air Force Space Command.Despite the success of American companies like SpaceX in the new space race, the U.S. is more vulnerable than ever to war in space. Russia and China are ramping up their offensive potential. And while the effects of space warfare on worldwide commerce would hurt the U.S. and its adversaries alike, the U.S. military's unmatched global footprint and forward-deployed posture mean it is especially dependent on space-based assets.IBD'S TAKE: A new Space Age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  So what was once a key enabler of U.S. dominance – famously on display during the first Gulf War when precision weapons and space-based imaging left the world awe-struck – is becoming a channel that adversaries can exploit to gain the upper hand.Russia and China ""are building those capabilities to challenge the United States of America, to challenge our allies and to change the balance of power in the world,"" Gen. John Hyten, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in December. ""We cannot allow that to happen.""On Feb. 21, Susan Gordon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence, warned that China and Russia have laser weapons designed to damage space-based sensors. Two days later, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein predicted that it will only be ""a matter of years"" before space warfare is waged.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAmid the growing alarm about a war in space, the Pentagon plans to pour more money into space capabilities. Companies like Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) — which make rockets, satellites and other space assets — are poised to receive those dollars.Space was once seen as a sanctuary from military activity, even as it served as a stage for Cold War bragging rights. The Outer Space Treaty, enacted in 1967, outlaws the use of nuclear weapons in space and prohibits testing weapons or building military bases on the moon or other celestial bodies. Since then, satellites have enveloped the planet, while the International Space Station has been maintained as a sign of global scientific cooperation.But China and Russia have made no secret of their space warfare ambitions and could have anti-satellite weapons ready for combat in the next few years, according to the latest threat assessment report from the U.S. intelligence community, released Feb. 13.The threat has been growing for years. In 2007, China shocked the world when it fired a ground-based missile to destroy an old weather satellite in what was widely seen as a test of an anti-satellite system.Last month's U.S. intelligence report said China has been training with such ground-based anti-satellite missiles, and Russia is developing similar technology.Blowing up a satellite carries risks for the attacker, as it would create a massive debris field of perhaps 10,000 pieces and could put its own satellites in jeopardy too.But the intelligence report noted less blunt methods, such as Russia's ""experiment satellites"" now in orbit. These satellites have official missions like inspection, refueling and repair, but could be turned into weapons that stop short of destroying their targets.China has a satellite with an extendable robotic arm that it says can be used to collect space junk but likely can also be used to cripple working satellites. And Russia reportedly has highly maneuverable satellites secretly launched into orbit in 2015 that can be used to bump into other satellites.The U.S. isn't helpless. It has potentially dual-use technology that could be given offensive missions too. Satellites that can dock with existing satellites to refuel them could be turned into weapons by ordering them to bump enemy satellites out of orbit or equipping them with jammers or lasers, says Theresa Hitchens, senior research associate at the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies. China has been working on similar technology.Northrop also provides anti-jamming capabilities but warns that ""only a very small amount of defense satellite communications are secure and protected against intercept and jamming threats."" The company declined to provide additional information about its anti-jamming and other defense capabilities for military or commercial satellites.Besides active defenses, the U.S. can make individual satellites less appealing as targets during a war in space.One way would be building large satellites used by many nations, so any attack would be seen as aggression against a potential coalition. Another way would be to develop more maneuverable satellites that could avoid collisions from other satellites, missiles or space debris.The military is also looking at deploying greater quantities of smaller satellites that spread out capabilities, instead of the current model of building large satellites that make ""juicy targets,"" according to Hyten.The U.S. can employ ground-based jammers, but they are only effective when the targeted satellite is in range. Lasers could also be used to temporarily blind or permanently disable a satellite, but the technology isn't mature enough yet to be effective against a large satellite.The bottom line is that the U.S. has much more to lose in space combat than its adversaries do.""We don't have good options for fighting back because this is an asymmetrical situation,"" as potential adversaries aren't as reliant on space systems, Hitchens said. ""It's not a tit-for-tat thing like it is for nuclear weapons.""Policymakers are aware of the threat and are working to address it. The National Defense Strategy released in January emphasized the need to ""prioritize investments in resilience, reconstitution, and operations to assure our space capabilities"" as ""attacks against our critical defense, government, and economic infrastructure must be anticipated.""In its fiscal 2019 budget request, the Air Force is seeking an 8% increase in space funding, the second straight year of significant increases to the space portfolio. The budget focuses on building more jam-resistant GPS satellites, while improving systems for missile warnings and situational awareness in space.Perhaps just as important as more funding and hardware is figuring out what kind of response an attack would merit. With no established norms of space warfare, it may be difficult to prevent an attack from spiraling out of control.For example, China could use an anti-satellite missile as a warning shot to tell the U.S. to back down and de-escalate a situation, Hitchens says. But the result could be the exact opposite. The U.S. could see the move as a sign of aggression and attack the missile's launch site, escalating the situation into an attack on the Chinese homeland.Another wrinkle is the fast-growing commercial space industry, with SpaceX showing it can deliver large military and spy satellites via its new Falcon Heavy rocket. SpaceX, Boeing and OneWeb are among the numerous companies with plans to launch thousands of satellites into low Earth orbit in the coming years.The new constellations about to enter space would provide space-based internet services as well as surveillance and tracking. Such capabilities are useful to companies that want to keep tabs on shipping fleets, but in theory they could help the military too.""If a commercial system is being deliberately used to provide the military with capabilities, in the time of war it's a legitimate target,"" Hitchens said.So what happens if China and Russia use their space assets on a commercial satellite? Is that an act of war?""That is a policy issue that is being actively discussed,"" said Stephen Flanagan, a senior political analyst at Rand Corp.While outer space is itself a vacuum, any fight there won't happen in a vacuum.Fairhurst says a war won't likely start in space. Instead, wars that start on the ground or at sea would extend into space.So options range from economic sanctions to a proportional response in a different domain, like an air- or ground-based attack.""We aren't locked into an answer,"" Fairhurst said. ""But the bottom line is that as a nation we have a right to defend ourselves if attacked. And just because we are attacked in space doesn't mean we have to respond in space.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing And Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In SpaceSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsIn This Space Race, Here's Where SpaceX May Not Come In First

Instead, the Democrats' memo ended up confirming several key accusations.For weeks Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee promised proof that Republican charges of FBI and Justice Department misconduct involving wiretaps on Trump campaign advisor Carter Page were bogus.The previous memo, drafted by Republicans on that committee, ""distorts the work of the FBI and the Department of Justice,"" said the committee's top Democrat, Adam Schiff.Schiff went so far as to contend that President Trump had been blocking the release of the Democrats' rebuttal because it would ""disprove"" Trump's claims that he'd been vindicated in his assertions that the Russian probe was politically tainted.""The president doesn't want you to see these facts from the FISA application because it completely undermines his claim of vindication,"" Schiff said.The White House did approve it — once it was properly redacted — and the memo came out on Saturday.And while the New York Times and other news outlets say the memo provides a ""forceful rebuttal,"" a careful reading shows that it actually ends up confirming the most damaging claims made by critics of the FBI probe. Namely,In other words, the Democratic ""rebuttal"" does nothing to refute charges that politically motivated officials in the Obama administration's FBI and Justice Department abused their authority to spy on a political opponent's presidential campaign.The Democrats' memo fully admits that DOJ officials used the discredited dossier in their application to the FISA court to obtain the Carter Page warrant. They just say that it wasn't central to that application. But of the four items the memo says the FBI used to demonstrate the need for the wiretap, only one would have been justification for the court's actually doing so — Page's ""suspicious activities"" in Russia in 2016 — a claim found only in the dossier.What's more, the memo states that it was only in subsequent applications to renew the FISA warrant that the FBI ""corroborated Steele's reporting"" — it doesn't say how — which means the initial application relied on uncorroborated claims in the dossier.Nor does the memo try to refute another point in the Republican memo: that former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe testified that a FISA warrant would never had been issued without the dossier. Democrats said that wasn't true when Republicans quoted McCabe, but their memo ignores the matter entirely.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD Newsletters""In their official, considered rebuttal, Democrats are not challenging it,"" explained the Washington Examiner's Byron York.The Democratic memo also claims that the FISA warrant wasn't used to spy ""on Trump or his campaign"" because Page wasn't working for the campaign when the first warrant was issued.But Democrats on this committee know full well that this warrant allowed the FBI not only to wiretap Page going forward, but to review his communications before the warrant was issued — when he was working with the campaign.""Clearly, they were hoping to find a mother lode of campaign communications,"" explains Andrew McCarthy, writing in National Review.The Democrats' memo also asserts that the DOJ was upfront with the court about who was paying Steele to dig up dirt on Trump. But the quote it pulls from the actual FISA application shows that, in fact, the DOJ took pains to avoid telling the court who was backing the dossier.The application merely states that the ""FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit (Trump's) campaign."" (The application didn't use names, but the ""U.S. Person"" was referring to Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.)Why be so vague — and why say ""speculate"" and ""likely"" — when the DOJ knew full well that it was the DNC and the Clinton campaign that paid Fusion GPS? This carefully worded evasion actually makes these officials look more guilty of misleading the court, not less.The Democratic memo makes it clear that the FBI and DOJ relied heavily on Steele's credibility to sell the court on the FISA warrant, because they didn't have any independent corroboration of his findings. But the memo doesn't rebut the claim that the court was never told about Steele's hatred of Trump.We now know that Steele told top FBI official Bruce Ohr in September 2016 — before the first FISA application — that he ""was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president."" This relevant information never made it into the FISA applications. The only thing the Democrats say is that the FISA court was told about Steele's ""frustration"" with the FBI regarding the Clinton email investigation. That hardly captures Steele's very relevant anti-Trump bias.So, what are we left with?It is still well within the realm of possibility that the Obama administration used a flimsy, Democrat-financed opposition research document, and then misled the court about its origins and credibility, to spy on the Trump campaign.That's been the central claim of critics of the dubious Trump/Russia investigation from day one, and nothing in the Democrats' memo comes close to refuting that troubling accusation.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Russia Scandal: Mueller's Latest Indictments Point To Democratic CollusionJustice, FBI Russia-Trump Investigation Just Got Even More Corrupt — Why Does It Continue?IBD's complete coverage of the Trump/Russia investigation.

55,GPS,"Special counsel Robert Mueller has indicted 13 Russian nationals for allegedly conspiring to sow confusion in the 2016 presidential election. The chance of extraditing any of the accused from Vladimir Putin's Russia is zero.XSome of the Russians' Keystone Cops efforts to disrupt the election favored Donald Trump (as well as Bernie Sanders). Yet Mueller's team made it clear that the Russians neither colluded with any U.S. citizens nor had any material effect on the election's outcome.But from here on out, there will be ironies, paradoxes and unintended consequences with just about everything Mueller does.Is it now time to prosecute foreigners for attempting to interfere with a U.S. election? If so, then surely Christopher Steele, the author of the Fusion GPS dossier, is far more culpable and vulnerable than the 13 bumbling Russians.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportSteele is not a U.S. citizen. Steele colluded with Russian interests in compiling his lurid dossier about Donald Trump. Steele did not register as a foreign agent. And Steele was paid by Hillary Clinton's campaign to find dirt on political rival Trump and his campaign.In other words, Steele's position is far worse than that of the Russians for at a variety of reasons. One, he is easily extraditable while the Russians are not. Two, his efforts really did affect the race, given that the dossier was systematically leaked to major media and served as a basis for the U.S. government to spy on American citizens. Three, unlike with the Russians, no one disputes that American citizens — Hillary Clinton, members of the Democratic National Committee, and anti-Trump partisan Glenn Simpson and his Fusion GPS team — colluded by paying for Steele's work.Mueller's team has also leveraged a guilty plea from former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn for making false statements to FBI investigators. If the Flynn case is now the Mueller standard, then we know that a number of high-ranking officials are vulnerable to such legal exposure.Department of Justice official Bruce Ohr deliberately omitted on federal disclosure forms the fact that his wife, an expert on Russia, worked on the Fusion GPS dossier.Steele himself probably lied to the FBI went he claimed he had not leaked the dossier's contents to the media.Hillary Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills likely lied to FBI investigator Peter Strzok (who had also interviewed Flynn) when they claimed they had no idea that Clinton was using a private and illegal email server until the story went public. In fact, Abedin and Mills had communicated with Clinton over the same server — as did then-President Barack Obama, who likewise denied that he knew about the improper server.Former FBI Director James Comey likely lied to Congress when he claimed that his exoneration of Clinton came after he had interviewed her. We now know from documents that he drafted a statement about the conclusion of the investigation even before he met with her.As far as obstruction charges go, Mueller has other possible targets. Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch met secretly with Bill Clinton on a jet parked on a tarmac in Phoenix shortly before the Justice Department closed the probe of Hillary Clinton and chose not to pursue charges against her. Comey said Lynch asked him not to use the word ""investigation"" when discussing the Clinton email probe. Text messages between Strzok and fellow FBI official Lisa Page suggest that Lynch knew in advance about the conclusions Comey would reach in the investigation.What is going on?Mueller is under enormous pressure to find collusion between the Trump team and Russia, or to find that the Trump team obstructed justice by trying to hide such collusion. But neither likely happened. Mueller was appointed at a time of national hysteria, brought on by partisan journalism based on a leaked dossier — itself a product of a discredited British agent working with Russian sources while being paid by the Clinton campaign.Worse still, the effort to hide the origins and the use of that dossier to obtain court permission to spy on American citizens may be a classic case of obstruction of justice.Mueller's existential problem has been with him from the start. Due to the shenanigans of his discredited friend Comey and a rabid media, he was appointed to investigate crimes that did not exist. But if they did exist, collusion and obstruction were committed by those associated with the Clinton campaign and even by members of the Obama administration.Investigating any possible crimes committed by members of the Clinton campaign or the Obama administration apparently is taboo, given the exalted status of both. But every time Mueller seeks to find incidental wrongdoing by those around Trump, he only makes the case stronger that behavior by those involved in the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration should be investigated.If such matters are not treated in an unbiased manner, we are not a nation of equality under the law, but a banana republic masquerading as a democracy.Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and the author of the recently released ""The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won,"" to appear in October from Basic Books.

58,GPS,"Whenever anyone suggested that officials at the FBI and Justice Department might have had a political bias that severely tainted both the investigation into the Trump-Russia and Hillary Clinton email scandals, they were called conspiracy-mongers or worse.XBut if the FBI and Justice are so squeaky clean of political bias, what accounts for the growing pile of top officials deeply involved in those supposedly aboveboard investigations who've been reassigned, demoted or have suddenly quit their jobs? There have been nearly half a dozen in just the past few weeks. Thankfully, reporter Sharyl Attkisson has been keeping a running tally.Here's a rundown.Laufman was Deputy Assistant Attorney General in charge of counterintelligence, cybersecurity, counterespionage and export controls. As the Washington Post put it, Laufman ""had a key role in the Justice Department's investigations of Hillary Clinton and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.""  He was one of the Justice officials who interviewed Hillary Clinton about her email use. Laufman suddenly quit his job last Wednesday, citing ""personal reasons.""His resignation came one day after the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee issued a scathing interim report on the FBI's handling of the Clinton email scandal, in which it said that ""a number of actions by high-level FBI officials"" have called the bureau's integrity and impartiality ""into question.""McCabe, the No. 2 at the FBI, had been planning to leave later this year, but unexpectedly resigned on Jan. 29. McCabe was one of the officials who signed off on the controversial FISA warrants for Carter Page, a warrant based largely on the tainted, Clinton-financed Trump dossier.It turns out that McCabe has been the focus of the Justice Department Inspector General's investigation into how the FBI handled the Clinton email scandal. In late January it came to light that for three weeks he'd apparently sat on information about piles of Hillary Clinton's emails showing up on the laptop of Anthony Weiner — the disgraced former congressman who was married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.Check Out IBD's Complete Coverage Of The Hillary Clinton Email ScandalAccording to the Washington Post, ""the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has been asking witnesses why FBI leadership seemed unwilling to move forward on the examination of emails found on the laptop of former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) until late October.""The FBI's general counsel was reassigned in late December amid an investigation by House Republicans into whether he was in contact with David Corn, a reporter for the leftist Mother Jones magazine, about the Trump dossier.Politico quoted sources as saying that documents showed Baker had been in contact with Corn, who was the first to report on the politically motivated dossier.Strzok, the No. 2 official in the FBI's counterintelligence division who had been instrumental in both the Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigations, was kicked off the staff of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and sent packing to the FBI's human-resources division, after a series of explosive texts with FBI lawyer and paramour Lisa Page — in which he expressed his utter disdain of Trump.Among other things, Strzok was responsible for watering down how the FBI described Clinton's actions, from ""grossly negligent"" to ""extremely careless."" Page had also been on Mueller's team, but had moved off that before the texts came to light, according to Mueller's office.Ohr had been associate deputy attorney general at Justice, a top-level position, and was director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces. In early December, after a House investigation turned up evidence that Ohr had met with Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and later with the founder of Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele — meetings Ohr failed to disclose— he was demoted. It also turned out that Ohr's wife had worked for Fusion GPSRybicki had been chief of staff to FBI Director James Comey; he resigned in late January to ""accept an opportunity in the corporate sector."" Republican lawmakers had been looking into Rybicki's role in the FBI's handling of the Clinton email scandal.Curiously, the mainstream press appears to be completely uninterested in the implications of these staff shake-ups, and the questions they raise about what it was exactly that the FBI and Justice were doing in the run-up to the November 2016 elections.Why would they? The Trump-hating press are entirely wedded to the idea that the Russia story will someday pay off. Whatever doesn't fit that narrative just gets ignored.RELATED:Russia-Trump Investigation: How Did Hillary Clinton Get FBI, FISA To Do Her Political Dirty Work?Most Think Obama White House Spied On Trump Campaign, Want Special Counsel: IBD/TIPP PollFBI Used Tainted Steele Dossier, Paid For By Hillary Clinton, To Spy On TrumpWant to make more money in the stock market?

59,GPS,"Why is the United States reliant on China and Russia for strategic minerals when we have more of these valuable resources than both these nations combined?XThis has nothing to do with geological impediments. It is all politics.This is an underreported scandal that jeopardizes American security. As recently as 1990, the U.S. was No. 1 in the world in mining output. But according to the latest data from the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. is 100% import dependent for at least 20 critical and strategic minerals (not including each of the ""rare earths""), and between 50% and 99% reliant for another group of 30 key minerals. Why aren't alarm bells ringing?This import dependency has grown worse over the last decade. We now are dependent on imports for vital strategic metals that are necessary components for military weapon systems, cellphones, solar panels and scores of new-age high-technology products. We don't even have a reliable reserve stockpile of these resources.Fortunately, the Trump administration is working to reverse decades of policies that have inhibited our ability to mine our own abundant resources, mostly in the western states — Montana, Colorado, Wyoming and the Dakotas. In December the Trump administration issued a long-overdue policy directive designed to open up federal lands and streamline the permitting process so America can mine again.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveNo nation on the planet is more richly endowed with a treasure chest of these metals than the U.S. The U.S. Mining Association estimates there are more than $6 trillion in resources. We could easily add $50 billion of GDP every year through a smart mining policy.Environmentalists are threatening to file lawsuits and throwing up other obstacles to this pro-economic development mineral policy — just as they oppose more open drilling for oil and gas. The stupidity of this anti-mining stance is that the green energy sources that they crave — solar and wind power — are dependent on rare metals to be viable.Rare earth minerals are the seeds for building new technologies, and a strong case could be made that these strategic metals are the oil of the 21st century.The suite of 15 primary minerals — which the U.S. has in abundance domestically — has been referred to as ""the vitamins of chemistry."" They exhibit unique attributes, such as magnetism, stability at extreme temperatures, and resistance to corrosion: properties that are key to today's manufacturing. These rare earth elements are essential for military and civilian use for the production of high-performance permanent magnets, GPS guidance systems, satellite imaging and night vision equipment, flat screens, sunglasses and a myriad of other technology products.Thanks to hostility to mining, huge portions of public lands in the west have not been explored or mapped in nearly enough detail to satisfy the hunt for minerals. It takes seven to 10 years to get mining permits here, versus two or three years in Australia and Canada. The nation must also map and explore again as was done in the Old West, when mining for gold, copper, coal and other resources was common.Mineral imports from China and Russia are providing enormous geopolitical leverage to these countries at precisely the wrong time in global events. China, Russia and others have used their mineral wealth to hold importing countries hostage. Do we want Vladimir Putin to hold the commanding heights on strategic minerals?We need a change in strategy and philosophy when it comes to mining. For federal land development, the 20th-century philosophy of ""lock up and preserve"" needs to be replaced with an ethic of ""use and explore."" We have hundreds of years of these resources with existing technology.China's leaders have been known to boast that the Middle East has the oil and China has the rare earth minerals. But that's false. We do. With a pro-mining policy, we can make America a mineral-exporting superpower, not an importer reliant on our adversaries. This strategy has worked like a charm when it comes to energy; it should be employed to yield the same America First results for strategic minerals.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

60,GPS,"Russia Scandal: Bit by bit, piece by piece, the growing scandal of the FBI's spying on the Trump campaign is being revealed for what it is: an effort to weaponize the federal intelligence bureaucracy for use by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Recent revelations point to former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and a secretive group of supporters and hangers-on both inside and outside of the FBI and Justice Department as having a far deeper personal involvement in the investigation than first thought.Fears of a politicized and manipulative ""deep state"" are looking less paranoid by the day.The involvement of Hillary Clinton campaign aides in both the FBI's and Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia's supposed ties to the Trump campaign in 2016 now seems deeper, and more nefarious, than first thought.The British left-wing newspaper the Guardian reported this week that the FBI has a second Trump dossier, in addition to the one compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.This second dossier allegedly was put together by Cody Shearer, a long-time aide and fixer for both Bill and Hillary Clinton going back to the 1990s.The Steele dossier, upon which the FBI's investigation appears to have been based, was financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. The second dossier, the one allegedly collected by Shearer, likewise was a Clinton team production.So was the entire Russia election scandal and the ensuing investigation nothing more than a Clinton operation all along? Starting to look that way.Last month, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina made a criminal referral on Steele to the FBI. A heavily redacted version of that letter was released this week.The letter refers to ""a foreign source (who) gave information to an unnamed associate of Hillary and Bill Clinton, who then gave information to an unnamed official in the Obama State Department, who then gave the information to Steele.""It's unclear who the ""unnamed associate of Hillary and Bill Clinton"" was, since the name was redacted.However, in a subsequent interview with Fox News, House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Trey Gowdy all but spilled the beans: the ""associate"" was longtime Hillary aide Sidney Blumenthal.So Hillary Clinton covered all the bases, having her own long-time associate, Cody Shearer, put together a dossier and at the same time, having Blumenthal and possibly also Shearer feed questionable information to Steele.The referral letter is important for another reason. It suggests that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) was duped by the ""apparent deception"" of Steele and, of course, Shearer.Using questionable information, Clinton, Steele, Blumenthal and Shearer were able to get the government to launch an intelligence surveillance operation against her political foe — something that should never happen.The letter says that the ""bulk"" of the application for surveillance against Carter Page, a fringe adviser to the Trump campaign, came from the Steele dossier. But it was never made clear to the court that the dossier was financed by Hillary Clinton's political campaign.So Clinton got the FBI's counterintelligence apparatus and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, in essence, to do her political dirty work.Grassley and Graham tread lightly in their referral on the apparent ineptitude of FISC in assessing the quality of the information that the dossiers provided. It was, the referral letter said, ""only minimally corroborated."" Even former FBI Director James Comey called it ""salacious and unverified.""So, to sell FISC on the idea that the information was widely known, the FBI supplied a Yahoo News piece written by Michael Isikoff that contained many of the same details as the Steele dossier. What they didn't say was that the Isikoff piece was based on information given to him by Steele.It was an evidentiary echo chamber.But while Grassley and Graham spared FISC from criticism for its slapdash work, it's clear, as The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway  writes, that the FISC verification of the information was ""so inadequate it resembles a concerted effort to conceal information from the (FISA) court.""Questions naturally arise, especially about a number of things that had previously been mysteries:Was former President Bill Clinton's impromptu meeting with then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a Phoenix airport in June of 2016 to coordinate strategy on Hillary's email scandal or the Russian investigation — or both?Most importantly, it now looks as if the FBI's ""Russian collusion"" case was based almost entirely on information doled out by Hillary Clinton operatives and a foreign spy, Steele, who was paid by Clinton and the Democratic Party and who had openly expressed an intense loathing of Donald Trump.The big question is just how deeply did Clinton get involved in pushing a politicized investigation whose increasingly clear intent was to take down, first, a major political foe, and, second, a sitting president?Hillary escaped charges in the email scandal, largely due to favorable handling by the FBI and by prejudicial remarks made by President Obama. Will she be charged with crimes this time if her direct involvement is further corroborated by facts, testimony and emails?RELATED:The Trump-Russia 'Dossier' Scandal DeepensThe FBI Is Looking Guilty As Hell In Russia Probe Fusion GPS' 'Fake Investigation' — And Hillary Clinton's Real Russian Collusion Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

63,GPS,"FBI Scandal: The controversial congressional memo that alleges abuse of the government's surveillance program has now been released to the public. A close reading of the four-page document reveals potentially damning evidence that the FBI and Department of Justice used an anti-Trump dossier funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign as the basis for spying on the Trump campaign.X GOP members of  the House Intelligence Committee, led by Chairman Devin Nunes, released the declassified memo Friday, but only after President Trump's approval and after both DOJ and FBI protested release of the document, which served as the backbone of the government's investigation into alleged collusion in the 2016 presidential campaign between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.Not surprisingly, President Trump had an immediate hot take for his Twitter feed: ""The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans — something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people!""No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe memo's findings are, at minimum, disturbing and, at worst, suggest the law was broken. Assuming the memo's factual accuracy, it paints an unflattering picture of the Obama-era FBI and Justice Department and their conduct in investigating the Trump campaign. To wit:Let us stipulate that this memo is itself a partisan product of a Republican-dominated committee of Congress. Democrats, for their side of the matter, have their own memo and claim that essential facts have been omitted from the GOP's. But none of the central facts of the memo, so far, have been disproved.Being charitable, it's possible to conclude that, during an intensely contentious presidential campaign, Obama administration Justice and FBI officials innocently sought FISA warrants against a peripheral Trump campaign volunteer based on a document they knew — or should have known — was paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC. And that their decisions later to withhold information from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court were equally innocent of any malicious political intent.Even if you grant that very generous reading of the facts laid out in the memo, it's clear there was at minimum a conflict of interest and, possibly, a violation of the 1939 Hatch Act, which forbids federal employees from political activities while on the job. If that weren't the case, why would a spate of Justice and FBI officials — including McCabe and Ohr — be either demoted, reassigned or let go in recent weeks?Yet, former FBI Chief James Comey, apparently vying for Twitter dominance over Trump, tweeted out: ""That's it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what? DOJ & FBI must keep doing their jobs.""Well, Comey's disingenuous ""That's it?"" includes the FBI colluding with a political party against another, while withholding material information from a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court about the source of its information and how it was paid for. Ethically questionable, certainly; illegal, quite possibly.The House Intelligence Committee's Democrats, in a statement, also criticized the memo: ""The premise of the Nunes memo is that the FBI and DOJ corruptly sought a FISA warrant on a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, and deliberately misled the court as part of a systematic abuse of the FISA process ... The FBI had good reason to be concerned about Carter Page and would have been derelict in its responsibility to protect the country had it not sought a FISA warrant.""Claims that release of this memo was inappropriate or dangerous are absurd. No intelligence methods were revealed. No big secrets, just the facts of an investigation that has gone on too long and has been used by political opponents and their Deep State allies to weaken a presidency. And it certainly calls into question the tortuous, now year-and-a-half long investigation into alleged Trump-Russia collusion during the 2016 election, spearheaded by former FBI chief Robert Mueller.As always with these issues, it's useful to imagine turning it all on its head: That instead of Republicans, the Democrats had been spied upon; that a Republican presidential candidate had funded the research on which the spying was based; and that it was all part of a deep-dive investigation, again, instigated by the Republicans to tie the Democrats to various Russian officials and their efforts to subvert a U.S. election.We would be told the nation was in grave danger. They would call it a silent coup. The liberal media would jump in. They would call it highly questionable and possibly illegal. And you know what? They might be right.RELATED:Democrats May Come To Regret Mueller Investigation Into Trump-Russia TiesFusion GPS' 'Fake Investigation' — And Hillary Clinton's Real Russian CollusionAs Investigations Of Misconduct Mount, Can Hillary Clinton Avoid Jail?FBI Scandal: McCabe's Resignation Is Only The BeginningClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Starting in September, the program is scheduled to proceed to intense combat testing that's likely to take a year, an exercise that's at least 12 months late already. Combat testing is necessary before the plane is approved for full-rate production -- the most profitable phase for Lockheed.Pentagon officials including Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and chief weapons buyer Ellen Lord have highlighted the need to reduce the F-35's $406.5 billion projected acquisition cost and its estimated $1.2 trillion price tag for long-term operations and support through 2070. Still, the Defense Department is moving to accelerate contracting and production for the fighter despite the persistence of technical and reliability issues disclosed in the current phase of development testing.Those issues include the increasing number of planes that are down awaiting spare parts, difficulties with the electro-optical targeting system and flaws in launching air-to-air missiles and GPS-guided air-to-ground munitions during weapons testing.A final version of the plane's complex software has gone through 31 variations and has yet to be deployed because of ""key remaining deficiencies,"" the report found. The troubles also include more mundane issues, such as tires on the Marine Corps version of the plane, the F-35B, that are proving less than durable.The upcoming testing, ""which provides the most credible means to predict combat performance, likely will not be completed until"" December 2019, according to the testing office.By the end of testing designed to demonstrate that the F-35 is operationally effective and suitable for its missions more than 600 aircraft already will have been built. That's about 25 percent of a planned 2,456 U.S. jets; 265 have been delivered to date.Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon's F-35 program office, and Lockheed spokeswoman Carolyn Nelson had no immediate comment on the new testing office report.In an earlier statement, Nelson said Lockheed's 66 F-35 deliveries in 2017 represented ""more than a 40 percent increase from 2016, and the F-35 enterprise is prepared to increase production volume year-over-year to hit full rate of approximately 160 aircraft in 2023.""

67,GPS,"Scandal: As Special Counsel Robert Mueller's vast and fruitless investigation into supposed ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government drags on, it's the FBI itself that appears to have been engaged in nefarious activities.X First there is the memo circulating among lawmakers on Capitol Hill regarding how the FBI went about obtaining its warrants to wiretap Trump campaign officials during the campaign.The speculation is that the memo — drafted by the House Intelligence Committee — will confirm what many already suspect, that the FBI used a phony ""dossier"" — which was nothing more than a factually challenged compilation of gossip and innuendo secretly financed by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign — to get those warrants.To hear from House Republicans who've seen it, the memo is explosive.""I can tell you I read it twice just to make sure I read it properly, and it was deeply disturbing,"" Ohio's Dave Joyce said. Mark Meadows, chair of the House Freedom Caucus, called the memo ""troubling"" and ""shocking,"" adding that ""part of me wishes that I didn't read it because I don't want to believe that those kinds of things could be happening in this country that I call home and love so much.""Dave Joyce said ""heads absolutely should roll,"" and Matt Gatetz predicted that ""people will go to jail"" based on what's in the memo.Democrats — and the press — are dismissing it as a political ploy to undermine Mueller's investigation and that the document is rife with errors and shouldn't be released.We won't know who to believe until the memo is released.It's certainly possible that Republicans are overselling the findings in that memo — in which case they have made a huge political blunder — but if that were true, then why are Democrats opposing its release?If it's as bad as Republicans say, what the Intelligence Committee findings mean is that the FBI used unsubstantiated politically motivated opposition research paid for by one campaign as a pretext to spy on members of another campaign.As Glenn Greenwald of the Intercept rightly explains, ""One of the gravest and most damaging abuses of state power is to misuse surveillance authorities for political purposes."" (Which makes the mainstream media's utter disinterest in this story so bewildering.)No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveMeanwhile, the FBI claims that five months' worth of text messages sent between virulently anti-Trump FBI officials working on the Trump-Russia probe have somehow gone missing. (The Justice Department's inspector general said on Thursday that his office had  ""succeeded in using forensic tools"" to recover those texts.)In a previously released batch of exchanges, FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page called Trump an ""utter idiot,"" said that Hillary Clinton ""just has to win,"" and talked about a mysterious ""insurance policy"" they had in case Trump won the election.The two had been involved in the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation, and until these exchanges were uncovered, had served on Mueller's team.A new batch of texts deepens the intrigue, with one mentioning (in jest, apparently) a ""secret society"" after Trump's victory in November, and another suggesting that the FBI needed to quickly close the books on the Clinton email investigation once Trump secured the nomination.Then there's the text where Strzok says he was conflicted about joining Mueller's team because the Russia investigation was, in his own estimation, much ado about nothing. ""You and I both know the odds are nothing,"" he texted. ""If I thought it was likely, I'd be there no question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern that there's no big there there.""But here's where things really get interesting. It turns out that the FBI couldn't find any of the texts the two sent each other from December 14, 2016, to May 17, 2017, which was the day Mueller was named Special Counsel. The FBI says it was due to a technical glitch. We shall see.One way of reading all this is that, despite the obvious political biases of these officials, the FBI acted impartially when it came to investigating Trump, did everything on the up and up when it came to wiretapping his campaign, and suffered an innocent technical problem that erased exchanges between two key officials.Another way of reading this is that corrupt FBI officials used the immense power at their disposal to illegally eavesdrop on private citizens, fuel a costly and bogus investigation into Trump — while giving Hillary Clinton a free pass on her own scandals — and then tried to keep these machinations under wraps.We are not conspiracy-mongers here. And we, like everyone in the country, want to be able to trust that our federal law enforcement officials aren't serving as political pawns.But the facts keep pointing to the latter interpretation.Editor's note: This editorial has been updated to reflect news developments since it was first published.RELATED:Explosive Texts Point To FBI, Not Russian, Meddling In 2016 ElectionAs Investigations Of Misconduct Mount, Can Hillary Clinton Avoid Jail?Fusion GPS' 'Fake Investigation' — And Hillary Clinton's Real Russian CollusionClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

69,GPS,"The most disappointed people in America this past week must be those Trump execrators who opened their Amazon package only to find that the copy of ""Fire and Fury"" they had ordered was subtitled ""The Allied Bombing of Germany, 1942-1945."" It's a well-regarded 2009 volume by University of Toronto historian Randall Hansen, who is surely grateful for the unanticipated royalties.X But it's not the red meat the customers were looking forward to consuming. Author Michael Wolff, whose royalties from a million sales in a week are much greater than Hansen's, has made no secret that he expects that his book will ""end"" the Donald Trump presidency. He apparently thinks his book will reveal to millions of Americans, for the first time, that their emperor has no clothes.That's unlikely to happen, for two reasons. One is that his ""Fire and Fury"" is laced with errors that reveal that the author, however knowledgeable he is about Manhattan media moguls, doesn't know much about national politics. Dick Armey was never speaker of the House. Kellyanne Conway was not a down-ballot pollster. Donald Trump was not ignorant of John Boehner's existence.Wolff affects a Trump-like insouciance about such inaccuracies. ""If it rings true, it is true,"" he told NBC News' Katy Tur. She responded, ""Congratulations on the book and congratulations on the president hating it.""The other reason Wolff's ambitions may prove to be as unfulfilled as those of the former Trump aide who appears to have been his chief source, Steve Bannon, is that the gist of his indictment — to the extent it's not fake news — is simply not news. Americans today, like American voters in November 2016, are aware that Trump makes outrageous and inaccurate statements.They know that his White House, like his campaign, is often in shambles, as have been many other presidential campaigns (read Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes' ""Shattered,"" on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign) and first-year White Houses (go back and read about the Bill Clinton White House in 1993). No one supposes Trump has the discipline and gravitas of Dwight Eisenhower. But neither have most of Eisenhower's successors.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth Perspective""Fire and Fury"" can be seen as the latest attempt to overturn the result of the 2016 election. Others have not fared well. Entertainers' attempts to persuade presidential electors not to vote for their pledged candidate failed.And the charges that Trump secured his victory by collusion with Vladimir Putin's Russia seem to be fizzling out. Instead, evidence suggests that the Obama FBI used Christopher Steele's dossier — commissioned by Fusion GPS, which was hired by the Clinton campaign for opposition research — to undermine Trump.As Hillary Clinton said before her defeat, acquiescence in the peaceful transfer of power is one of the strengths of a representative democracy. Yet the impulse of many Democrats and never-Trumpers is to style themselves the ""Resistance"" and to attempt to overturn an election result they consider deplorable.The Wolff book is the latest example — and perhaps one that discredits the enterprise. ""The anti-Trump movement, of which I'm a proud member, seems to be getting dumber,"" writes New York Times columnist David Brooks in response. It suffers from ""insularity,"" he goes on, and from ""lowbrowism.""As Brooks points out, Trump and the Republican-majority Congress are making attempts to govern. He sees, behind Trump's tweets and tantrums, ""a White House that is briskly pursuing its goals: the shift in our Pakistan policy, the shift in our offshore drilling policy, the fruition of our ISIS policy, the nomination for judgeships and the formation of policies on infrastructure, DACA, North Korea and trade.""Trump's opening up to cameras his White House meeting with congressional leaders of both parties on immigration may have been an attempt to counter the picture Wolff presents. The president seemed knowledgeable about the issues and respectful in eliciting and listening to the views of others.He also seemed to be accepting contrary views and to be relinquishing his leverage as a chief executive with the power to veto legislation. That's disturbing to those who want him to insist on legislative enactment of restrictions on chain migration, an end to the visa lottery, a requirement that employers use E-Verify and funding of the border wall.Also, it's not clear that his administration is coming up with an infrastructure proposal in line with his campaign rhetoric or that it's producing nominees for many important administrative positions. There's plenty of room for criticism — which is likely to be more productive than attempting somehow to overturn an election.RELATED:Fusion GPS' 'Fake Investigation' — And Hillary Clinton's Real Russian CollusionOprah And The Unbearable Lightness Of DemocratsDon't Wait For The Trump Boom — It's Already HereClick here for more†Commentary and Opinion†from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

70,GPS,"Election 2020: The wave of enthusiasm sweeping Democrats and liberal pundits for an Oprah Winfrey presidential run in 2020 shows just how bankrupt the party is of ideas and how bereft it is of credible national leaders.XTalk of talk show celebrity Oprah Winfrey running for president is hardly new. There were appeals going back more than a decade — ABC News ran a segment in 2003 called ""Oprah for President?"" Almost as soon as Trump won the 2016 elections, some were arguing that she was the person to beat him in 2020. But it was her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes over the weekend that created the tidal wave.Everywhere, Democrats and media pundits gushed about the prospect of Oprah running, even though none could identify a single issue on which she's taken a stand, and even though advocating for her goes against pretty much everything Democrats have been saying about what qualifies someone to be president.Take for example, the party's alleged devotion to issues. Oprah has taken no noticeable stands on any of them. She's claimed to have voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and refused to publicly endorse any president until Barack Obama.Staying politically neutral was a smart business decision, since she didn't want to alienate any part of her fan base. But for all Democrats know, Oprah could be a New Democrat centrist. After all, as a successful businesswoman, she has, unlike most Democratic politicians, actually had to make payroll, deal with government regulations and pay enormous amounts of taxes. Putative conservative commentator Bill Kristol seems to think she's a closet moderate, at least, saying in a tweet this week: ""Oprah: Sounder on economics than Bernie Sanders, understands Middle America better than Elizabeth Warren, less touchy-feely than Joe Biden ... .""The problem is that a centrist Oprah would put her well out of the mainstream of the increasingly leftist Democratic Party, which insists its candidates endorse socialized medicine and attack the rich.What about her lack of experience? Democrats once insisted that at least some political experience was a prerequisite for the job — Obama, for example, blasted Trump during the 2016 campaign as ""uniquely unqualified"" because he'd never held office. Oprah has less experience at politics than Trump, who, by the time he threw his hat in the ring, had authored several books detailing his views on various issues.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveOprah's record is so blank that when ""explanatory journalism"" site Vox.com set out to tell readers ""What we could expect from an Oprah administration,"" it provided absolutely no information on the topic.For the alleged ""party of science"" to gush over Oprah is especially amusing. It wasn't that long ago that Newsweek ran a cover story blasting Oprah for repeatedly peddling medical quackery on her show.""All too often,"" the article said, ""Oprah winds up putting herself and her trusting audience in the hands of celebrity authors and pop-science artists pitching wonder cures and miracle treatments that are questionable or flat-out wrong, and sometimes dangerous.""Oprah provided a massive platform for anti-vaccine advocate Jenny McCarthy, which prompted parents across the country to avoid vaccinating their kids and contributed to outbreaks of measles and whooping cough. She promoted Suzanne Somers' hormone therapy, which science has shown can increase a woman's risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and cancer. She touted James Arthur Ray, whose $10,000-a-pop ""Spiritual Warrior"" retreat — which involved days of fasting in an Arizona desert before sitting in a sweat lodge — led to three deaths and got Ray convicted of negligent homicide.There's also the inconvenient fact that pundits don't get to anoint presidents, or even presidential candidates, in this country. They first have to get through the buzz saw of the primaries. Does anyone think that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden or whoever else is dreaming of taking on Trump in 2020 will simply step aside and hand the nomination over to Oprah because she's a billionaire celebrity?More likely, they will be busy hiring Fusion GPS to scour the earth for dirt in hopes of ruining the reputation Oprah and the sycophantic celebrity press have spent a lifetime protecting. How she'd respond to such attacks is a complete mystery.There's no doubt that Oprah Winfrey has an incredible rags-to-riches story to tell, and like Trump, she's been hugely successful in business. She deserves all the credit for this tremendous achievement, which she accomplished against long odds. Her story is a testament to what is great about America.But whether Oprah would make a good president depends entirely on the sorts of economic and foreign policies she'd pursue, about which we know absolutely nothing.In the meantime, the over-the-top response to Oprah's substance-free acceptance speech at a Hollywood award ceremony has left Nancy Pelosi as the voice of reason in the Democratic Party.""I think one of the arguments for Oprah is 45,"" Pelosi said, referencing the 45th president, Donald Trump.

71,GPS,"Clinton Scandals: As the media focus on Donald Trump's mental condition and whether he can be kicked out of office using the 25th Amendment, something far more significant is taking place: Former slam-dunk-future-first-woman-president Hillary Clinton, after avoiding any serious scrutiny for her misconduct while secretary of state, now sits at the center of a growing number of investigations — any of which might lead to a special counsel and criminal charges.No doubt, Democrats, who with the leftist media allies have ginned up bogus charges of Russian collusion against Donald Trump, would like the Clinton investigations to go away.X But they won't. In recent weeks, new developments have made it shockingly clear that questions about Clinton's possibly criminal conduct are growing. All of these have come in the last month:No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIn short, it could be a bombshell that will leave the Clinton Foundation ""charity"" a smoking crater, and utterly destroy any hopes Hillary Clinton had for a political comeback. And it may also tarnish if not ruin the reputations of a number of high-level officials in the Justice Department and FBI during the Obama years.Yes, we know. Investigations come and go. They're an inevitable part of the changing of a government. Maybe so.But unlike past investigations, which covered up the magnitude of Clinton's actions and their likely criminal content, the latest ones are not being conducted by Democratic Party partisans from the Deep State who have, in communications revealed to the public, expressed open disdain for their soon-to-be president Trump and fought a rear-guard action to keep Hillary Clinton out of legal danger.All Americans should root for the same thing: the truth. Based on current investigations and from what we now know of her past actions, which we have written on extensively here, Hillary Clinton will be very lucky indeed to escape not just prosecution, but incarceration.RELATED:Clinton Foundation Scandal  Will Justice Investigate Hillary Clinton's Crimes In Uranium One-Fusion GPS Scandal?

72,GPS,"Russian Scandal: The Fusion GPS mess just keeps getting messier. New court filings show that the opposition research firm that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee hired to dig up dirt on Donald Trump also paid at least three journalists. For what? Was it part of a Democratic plan to spread fake news about Trump?XIt may be that people are becoming jaded about the news emerging on Fusion GPS. But, increasingly, it appears to be the nexus of a massive campaign by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party for a post-election investigation into Trump's supposed ""ties"" to Russian officials.Now come two stunning revelations that only make the Fusion GPS picture sleazier, if that's possible.Fritsch asserted that the payments in question ""are not pertinent to work related to Russia or Donald Trump."" Sounds clear cut. But the Examiner's Todd Shepard notes that ""One of the documents filed by lawyers for the House Intelligence Committee said each of the three reporters who received payments had written about the Russia probe, which could indicate that reporters were using Fusion GPS's work to write their stories.""That would seriously undermine Fritsch's assertion. Moreover, in another filing, the lawyers maintained that Fusion GPS ""brokered meetings for (Trump) dossier author Christopher Steele with at least five major media outlets in September 2016, including Yahoo news.""Did Fusion GPS intentionally mislead Congress? It seems like a real possibility.Meanwhile, as has previously been reported, neither the FBI nor the Justice Department have been able to ""verify or corroborate"" the allegations of collusion between Russia and Trump that came from the Trump dossier.More and more, it looks like a giant setup, intended to trap then-candidate Donald Trump into implicating himself in a plot to undermine the U.S. election. But it was Clinton and her bought-and-paid-for lackeys in the DNC who were in fact colluding with Russian officials.We promised a second revelation, so here it is:And who paid BakerHostetler to make that payment to Fusion GPS? Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, through his company, Prevezon Holdings. Indeed, it turns out that Fusion founding partner and former Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson compiled the information for Katsyv.This is yet another Russian link to Fusion GPS. The man whom Fusion paid to concoct the Trump Dossier, former British spy Christopher Steele, interviewed a number of Russian officials for his Trump research, and was paid $168,000 for his work by Fusion.The picture emerges of Fusion, the Democrats and the Russians colluding to eliminate a wild-card politician that could be trouble for all of them.Moreover, in a separate transaction, the Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie paid out some $1,024, 408 between May 2016 and the end of that year, the records show. The biggest check was $365,275 made on Oct. 28, 2016, just days before the election.And who was Perkins Coie? The attorneys for both the Clinton campaign and the DNC.Again, the point is, the fingerprints of Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party and Russian officials are all over the infamous Trump Dossier. But, as of yet, there has been no actionable evidence of actual ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.More and more, as we said, this looks like a classic setup — a rather clumsy one, until you consider that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were pretty sure she was going to win. All of this would have simply been swept under the rug by deep-state bureaucrats in the Justice Dept. and at the FBI on behalf of President Hillary Clinton.Based on this, we'll reverse the logic that the left has employed against Trump now for well over a year: If it turns out that the Clinton campaign and DNC not only funded Fusion GPS but also directly or indirectly colluded with Russian officials to subvert an American presidential election, they will be liable for criminal charges — and possibly jail time.As for the three journalists we mentioned above, if they used this information as the basis of their Russia reporting, it will turn out to be a scandal from which U.S. journalism will have trouble recovering. The media is already held in such low repute by the public that it's hard to think it can go lower. But it can.RELATED:Will Justice Investigate Hillary Clinton's Crimes In Uranium One-Fusion GPS Scandal? Deep State Run Amok?

Retail stocks and groups were market leaders Tuesday, with Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) among the big winners, with Wal-Mart (WMT) moving closer to a buy. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) was a big laggard, dragging down chip stocks such as Micron Technology (MU) and Broadcom (AVGO), while Facebook (FB) continues to struggle.X What's more surprising is that this is not a one-day phenomenon. Left for dead for much of the year, retailers have come roaring back, especially during the holiday shopping season. Meanwhile, Apple, chips and FANG stocks have been lackluster to down.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures and Dow futures climbed nearly 0.2% vs. fair value.The Retail-Department Store group rose 3.5% on Tuesday, leading all 197 industries tracked by IBD. Macy's climbed 4.6% and Kohl's 6%. Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories popped 1.8%, Gap (GPS), Ross Stores (ROST), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) among the strong performers. Triggering Tuesday's move: Holiday retail sales rose the most since 2011, according to Mastercard Advisors.But since the Thankgiving holiday, the S&P Retail Index has climbed 6%, IBD's Department Store group has popped 22% and the Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry has rallied 17%.Retailers aren't offering many potential buy points. Wal-Mart is a big exception, rising 1% Tuesday to just 1% off a new entry. But most retail stocks are already extended — like Gap, Five Below (FIVE) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) — or rebounding from a long slump like Kohl's.Will retail continue to outperform? On the upside, unemployment continues to drift lower while wage gains appear to be picking up, especially for blue-collar workers. The Trump tax cuts also could give a modest boost to discretionary income. On the downside, brick-and-mortar retailers may have bested expectations, but many are still fighting an uphill battle in e-commerce, where Amazon dominates and Wal-Mart is a serious player.Meanwhile, Apple has fallen 3% over that span.

But as of 10 a.m. ET today, $840 million had been spent online, representing growth of 16.9%.Overall web traffic is up 12%, with mobile traffic representing a record high 53.3% of visits plus 39.7% of revenue, Adobe added. Growth was also up sharply from Saturday and Sunday, which brought in a total of $5.12 billion online, up 10.1%.So which stores are racking up major sales, and which ones are desperate for shoppers?Toys and gadgets were predictably hot on Black Friday: the Nintendo (NTDOY) Switch, Hatchimals and Colleggtibles, PJ Masks, L.O.L. Surprise Dolls, Ride On Cars, and Google (GOOGL) Chromecast and Roku (ROKU) streaming devices were top sellers, said Adobe.Computers, TVs and toys were the most discounted products on Friday, and shoppers looking to complete their holiday shopping will likely find great deals on toys again today, as toys are expected to get the biggest price cuts on Cyber Monday. Piper Jaffray said Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) was the busiest store its analysts visited in both Minnesota and Texas over the weekend.""Overall, we think (Thanksgiving/Black Friday) was strong even though it continued to be diluted by online sales and earlier sales that began in early November and heightened the weekend before (Black Friday),"" wrote B. Riley FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""However, given the cold spurt in early November we believe outerwear was a big purchase early on which left room for apparel purchases over BF, particularly given the new fashion cycle.""At the mall, American Eagle (AEO) (and its Aerie brand), Build-A-Bear Workshop, L Brands' (LB) Pink and Gap (GPS) chain Old Navy came out on top on Black Friday, she said, ""managing sales/promos that should lead to good top lines and bottom lines.""Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Abercrombie-owned Hollister also merited callouts from Anderson, although traffic at both stores was lower than that of the top performers. The firm's analysts spotted mall visitors toting Victoria's Secret, Build-A-Bear, American Eagle, Macy's (M), Forever 21 and Lululemon (LULU) bags more than any others.""Fashion apparel looked to be the key items over TG/BF, while activewear continued to be challenged and even though athletic footwear appeared strong it was mainly driven by discounts,"" wrote Anderson.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Struggling Under Armour (UAA) offered 50% discounts at its factory outlets, noted analysts, a contrast to Nike's (NKE) 25%-off promotion at outlet stores and Adidas' (ADDYY) more-modest promotions.But even as shoppers hit the registers this past weekend, the American mall continues to suffer. Brick-and-mortar traffic fell over 7.5% on Black Friday, and same-store retail traffic fell over 3%, according to Cowen, citing national traffic devices. And stores like Sears (SHLD) are doing the best they can to reclaim foot traffic as the heyday of department stores looks to be permanently in the rearview mirror.Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom called out Wal-Mart (WMT), Kohl's (KSS), Amazon (AMZN), and Dollar Tree (DLTR).""Looking ahead, roughly 85% stated they intend to make a purchase on Cyber Monday – so taking all of it together ... the weekend looks like it was a winner for most,"" he wrote.Macy's shares climbed 0.7% on the stock market today. Gap shares rose 1.3% to 21.21, retaking a 20.87 buy point. Wal-Mart was unchanged.

75,GPS,"KKR, the global investment firm, has given a masterclass on how not to do private equity (PE) in Africa, at least in the Wall Street Journal's telling of it.Unlike Carlyle and others, the company did not set up a dedicated Africa fund. The $200 million it invested in a Holland-based Ethiopian rose business — its one Africa deal — came from funds raised to invest chiefly in European companies.X KKR's Africa specialists were competing for the same pot of capital as their colleagues who were pitching German, French and other European deals to KKR's investment committee. It's no wonder many of them left, some to launch their own Africa private-equity funds using more appropriate models.Clearly, KKR and Africa were not a good fit. KKR likes to do deals valued at $200 million and up, and at this point there are just not a lot of those to be had in Africa.What's worrying is that KKR's misreading of the African deal environment will be blamed on the lack of real opportunities, not KKR's reluctance to adapt its preferred business model to the opportunities that exist. I am already hearing skeptics citing the Wall Street Journal report to back their contention that the Africa Rising narrative was an artifact of the commodity super-cycle, nothing more.The Wall Street Journal's reporters naturally went looking for examples of other big U.S. private-equity firms that were, as they put it, ""struggling to make their African investments pay off.""Among those they identified was Bain Capital, whose leveraged buyout of South African retail chain Edcon ended badly with Bain having to surrender equity to lenders. The problem in this instance was that Bain borrowed way too much and too expensively to be able to invest in growing Edcon's value.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveAgain, Bain's largely self-inflicted wounds are not a fair reflection of the African PE experience.A better gauge is to be found in the annual surveys of limited partners (LPs) by the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA).  In private equity parlance, limited partners are the sources of capital which general partners (GPs) invest in ventures that meet their criteria and objectives.Limited partners include pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and development finance institutions like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation.AVCA's latest survey, released in October and covering all those classes of limited partners, found fully 88% planning to increase their allocations to private equity in Africa over the coming three years. 63% see Africa as a more attractive destination than all other emerging and frontier markets over the next decade.In the nearer term, 64% do acknowledge that general partners' greatest challenge may be the current fundraising climate, even if those surveyed don't see themselves reducing their allocations to Africa.The signs of waning appetite are undeniable. Africa private equity funds raised $2.3 billion in 2016, down from $4.3 billion in 2015.But as one general partner who specializes in African housing construction put it, the issue is less the unattractiveness of Africa than the fact that ""everywhere else is rocking and rolling at the moment so emerging markets in general are out of favor.""If fundraising has slowed, deal flow has not. The total value of private equity deals in Africa in 2016 rose to $3.8 billion by AVCA's count from $2.5 billion a year earlier. Limited partners say they are particularly interested in businesses that leverage Africa's rising disposable incomes, including consumer goods and financial services.I am very encouraged that investors are starting to appreciate Africa's capacity to generate growth internally without having to depend on global commodity cycles.Private equity, using the appropriate models, has a critically important role to play in Africa's march to prosperity. Much is made of the continent's risk profile, with political and currency risks presently the kinds most often cited. One of private equity's strengths lies in managing and navigating risks.Shrewd, experienced general partners who have good networks and know the terrain intimately can identify promising businesses the market is undervaluing because of perceived risks and can turn currency fluctuations to their advantage by timing acquisitions and exits appropriately.Effective partners identify value and then build it between entry and exit. Unlike the managements of public-traded firms, they are spared from pressure to post gains every quarter and can adopt longer-term strategies in building the businesses in which they have invested.Successful businesses tend to have a positive impact on the environments in which they operate, reducing perceived risks and improving valuations for their investors upon exit.This is the kind of virtuous cycle that private equity, at its best, can generate in Africa while earning handsome profits for partners. Not every deal will be a success, of course, but failure, if learnt from, can often be as healthy as success. Let us hope the KKR experience teaches the right lessons.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

76,GPS,"Clinton Scandals:  A New York Times headline says it all: ""Justice Dept. to Weigh Inquiry Into Clinton Foundation."" Yes, the pressure is growing to fully investigate Bill and Hillary Clinton for their many questionable activities tied to their charitable foundation and to Fusion GPS, the creator of the largely bogus Trump dossier. Given the mountains of evidence of possible criminal wrongdoing, it's about time.On Oct. 24 the Washington Post, of all publications, reported that the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS to dig up all the dirt it could find on Donald Trump.XAs we noted last month, beginning in April 2016, a Clinton attorney, Mark Elias of Seattle-based Perkins Coie, paid Fusion GPS for the opposition Trump research. For the record, Elias worked with former White House Counsel Robert Bauer, who was also a partner at Perkins-Coie, known for its Democratic Party ties.From June 2015 to December 2016, Perkins Coie took in $5.4 million from the DNC and a whopping $12.4 million from the Clinton campaign as ""legal fees."" Perkins Coie's Elias secretly paid Fusion GPS for its ""research"" from the legal fees that Hillary Clinton and the DNC forked over.Funded to the hilt, Fusion GPS hired a former British spy named Christopher Steele, who previously headed British intelligence agency MI-6's Russian desk, ultimately paying him $168,000. Using his many Russian contacts, Steele put together a Trump dossier filled with rumors, innuendos and some outright lies — the kind of thing that could be incredibly damaging to Trump in a last-minute campaign blitz.All of this is bad enough. None of it was disclosed in Federal Election Commission filings as required by law, so there is a very sound basis for legal action.And somehow the dubious dossier made its way into the hands of both the media and the FBI, raising the obvious question: Did the FBI use essentially a political document funded by the Democrats to seek special surveillance from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on officials in the Trump campaign? Is that what started the whole ""Trump collusion with Russia"" ball rolling? If so, it's likely a major crime has been committed, one that would dwarf Watergate in its dimensions.But it goes even deeper than that.While the media shriek about the Trump campaign's alleged Russia ties, the Democratic Party in general and the Clinton campaign in specific had very clear links to nefarious Russian figures, both inside and outside of Vladimir Putin's government.Going back to the very beginnings of the Obama administration, Russian leader Vladimir Putin made extraordinary efforts to get a dominant foothold in the U.S. nuclear industry. Using the Russian state-owned nuclear monopoly Rosatom, Putin engaged in a campaign of ""bribery, extortion, (and) money laundering"" in his efforts to acquire Uranium One, a Canadian-based nuclear materials company that controls 20% of all U.S. domestic uranium supplies, according to Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Obama's Justice Department, then under Eric Holder, knew about this but did nothing about it. And, despite knowing about Russia's illegal activities, when the Rosatom bid to take over Uranium One came up for a vote, the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) approved it in 2010. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a member of the CFIUS board, voted in favor of the deal. So did Holder.If that sounds funny, it should. Because it turns out that the Clinton Foundation, the global ""charity"" run by Bill and Hillary, had taken in an estimated $145 million from Uranium One shareholders and executives, mostly around the time the deal was being approved.The Justice Department waited until 2014, after Hillary's departure from office, to do anything about the Russian criminal activity. And details of the Uranium One deal didn't even emerge until 2015, after Holder left office. It reeks of quid-pro-quo double-dealing that involved Clinton using her powerful office of secretary of state to enrich her own private foundation and family.Americans may be starting to come around to the idea that something very bad happened.Our own IBD/TIPP Poll released earlier this month shows that, among those who are closely following the uranium deal, some 59% believe that ""Russian donations to the Clinton Foundation played a role in the previous administration's decision to approve the (Uranium One) deal"" with Russia.And 54% said they agreed either ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" that Special Counsel Robert Mueller ""has a conflict of interest (in investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election) since he was the FBI director at the time of the 2010 uranium deal.""We began saying way back in 2016 that this entire affair deserved to be investigated. Last year, the FBI, under then-Director James Comey, made it known it was doing just that, though there has been no further comment.Based on what has been revealed, it's time for the Justice Department to step up. We continue to believe that a special counsel or federal prosecutor needs to be appointed to see if members of the Obama administration — in particular former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — were guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors in their dubious dealing with the Russians.RELATED:Deep State Run Amok?

79,GPS,"SpaceX successfully launched a used rocket and a used capsule for the first time Friday, in a mission for NASA that will ferry cargo to the International Space Station, as Elon Musk's company and Boeing (BA) look toward major milestones for the commercial space industry in 2018.X The launch, which took place on time at 10:36 a.m. ET, featured a previously flown Dragon cargo capsule and a previously flown Falcon 9 first-stage booster.The booster successfully landed back at Cape Canaveral roughly two and a half minutes after liftoff. The Dragon capsule is set to dock with the ISS on Sunday.SpaceX has recycled rockets as well as capsules before, but never on the same flight. For today's NASA mission, SpaceX used a Falcon 9 that was previously launched in June and a Dragon capsule that was previously used in April 2015.The mission was originally scheduled for Dec. 8 but was delayed to Dec. 12 before being pushed back to Dec. 13 and then Dec. 15 after particles were found in the second-stage fuel system.While the latest SpaceX launch was for NASA, its success could help the company win more contracts from the Pentagon, which is also looking at reusable rockets to help lower costs.At the Air Force Association's annual Air Space & Cyber conference in September, Gen. John Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command, told reporters that reusable rockets were ""the way the industry is going. It's cost effective."" But he said the service needs to do a review to make sure they are safe.The Air Force hasn't been so open to the idea in the past. Just last year, the director of launch enterprise for Space Command's Space and Missile Systems Center said it could be a ""long time"" before the Pentagon approves the use of a reusable rocket to launch national-security payloads.Boeing shares ended virtually unchanged at 293.94 on the stock market today, while Lockheed Martin (LMT) rallied 1.8% to 322.82, clearing a 322.29 buy point from a flat base. Boeing and Lockheed have a joint venture, United Launch Alliance, that provides launch services for the Pentagon.IBD'S TAKE: Investors can't get a piece of SpaceX or Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin yet. But you can discover other innovative companies on the IBD 50 list of top stocks. Friday's Falcon launch sets the stage for SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launch.The new rocket, which SpaceX is touting as the most powerful operational rocket in the world, is set to launch from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., next month. But no sensitive NASA instruments will be on board. Musk tweeted earlier this month that the Heavy's first payload would be his midnight cherry Tesla (TSLA) Roadster playing David Bowie's ""Space Oddity.""The Heavy's first government payload, a GPS system, is scheduled for later next year.The next frontier for SpaceX is sending astronauts to the ISS. SpaceX and Boeing are scheduled to test manned capsules in 2018 with manned service missions to the ISS starting in 2019.Friday's SpaceX launch capped an eventful week for the commercial space industry.On Tuesday, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched a reusable suborbital rocket from the company's Texas launch site.

81,GPS,"Economy: After eight long years of subpar growth, economists now warn that the economy, which is just starting to show signs of life, is at risk of overheating. Can these warnings be believed?X While Republicans were debating the particulars of their tax plan, various economists were busy warning that enacting a pro-growth tax cuts would risk ""overheating"" the economy.The argument goes like this: The best the U.S. economy can do these days is about 2% annual GDP growth, which is the path it's currently on. If the tax cuts boost growth above this pace, there's a risk that it could spark inflation, which would require the Fed to raise rates, which would risk a recession.But who says the economy can only grow at 2%? And why? The answer is remarkably simple, and almost certainly wrong.To get at that 2% figure, economist basically add together the growth in the labor force and a measure of output-per-worker — better known as productivity. Based on current trends, the expectation is that the population will climb at slightly less than 1% a year, and productivity will climb at about 1% a year.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth Perspective""This is why many economists argue that the U.S. economy has a potential growth rate of 2% per year, possibly less,"" notes First Trust chief economist Brian Wesbury. ""And they also say it can't be fixed.""Wesbury, along with his colleagues Robert Stein and Strider Elass, explain that while population growth is fairly easy to measure, productivity isn't.In fact, they say, the government is underestimating real productivity growth, because it doesn't know how to measure the impact of new technologies.""Yes, government sources say it's weak. But anyone who goes outside instead of living in the data knows nearly everything is getting better, faster and cheaper,"" they write. They note that, among other problems, the government doesn't know how to account for free stuff, like GPS navigation on smartphones, free language translators, Google search results when it measures productivity.Zachary Karabell, writing for Bloomberg View, notes that, as a result, ""there is a growing chasm between what our economic system is and what our numbers are capable of measuring.""Wesbury and company point out that, to the extent that overall productivity isn't higher, one big reason is government. Indeed, two of the industries with the worst productivity growth in the past decade have been power generation and banking — both of which are extremely heavily regulated by government.Putting this together, it would seem that there is clearly room for additional growth without sparking inflation, especially if the Trump administration continues to liberate industries from excessive, productivity-killing, government regulations.Indeed, the bigger risk isn't that the economy will overheat, but that the Fed will overreact and raise rates too aggressively.RELATED:China And Europe See What U.S. Critics Don't: A U.S. Tax-Cut Boom Is ComingIt's Official: Tax Cuts Will Grow The Economy The Coming Tax-Cut BoomMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

84,GPS,"Election Meddling: With every new revelation, the ""dossier"" on President Trump, which got the entire Trump-Russia-collusion story going, looks more and more scandalous. Not because of what it reveals about Trump, but what it is revealing about behind-the-scenes efforts to ruin his presidency. The latest twist involves a senior Justice Department official who was just demoted for his connection to it.When the existence of the now-discredited dossier first came to light, it was described simply as information compiled by a former British intelligence operative with a high degree of credibility in the spy community.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe fact that a two-page summary had been presented to Trump and President Obama in early January lent it still more credibility. As one news outlet put it, the dossier was ""credible enough to warrant inclusion of their claims in the highly classified report on Russian interference in the presidential campaign.""From that point on, it was treated as an authoritative report pointing to Trump's collusion with Russians to meddle in the U.S. election.It was only much later — and long after its phony claims had been seared into the public's consciousness — that the truth about this dossier started to emerge.And everything that we've learned since has seriously undermined its credibility, while raising troubling questions about how the FBI and the Justice Department under Obama used it.The most explosive revelation was that the dossier was bought and paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, a fact that the Clinton campaign took pains to hide, that Clinton officials lied about, and that Fusion GPS refused to reveal on its own. It wasn't an intelligence report at all. It was a political hit job paid for by Trump's opponent.X We also learned that, despite the dossier's highly dubious claims and its partisan provenance, the FBI under Obama embraced it.In fact, just a few weeks before the election, the FBI tried to hire Christopher Steele to continue his work. And then it purposely raised the dossier's credibility — and got its details outed in the press — by handing that summary over to Trump and Obama just before Trump was sworn in.The big remaining question is whether the Obama administration used the dossier as an excuse to wiretap Trump campaign officials, unmask their names and leak information to the press.The latest twist in this regard came last week, when the Justice Department demoted Bruce Ohr, who was associate deputy attorney general, after Fox News reported that Ohr had held secret meetings with the dossier's author, Christopher Steele, before the election, and with Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson shortly after the election to discuss the dossier.We now learn that Ohr's connection to Fusion GPS was closer still — since his wife worked there while the dossier was being compiled.At best, this shows a clear conflict of interest on Ohr's part that should have been disclosed long ago. At worst, this latest revelation supports the contention that top Justice officials and the FBI were working with Democrats to keep Trump out of the White House, which in case anyone cares, is highly illegal. And then when that failed, they colluded to wreck his presidency.As the Washington Examiner's Byron York put it, ""with news of Ohr's contacts with Steele and Simpson, Republicans on Capitol Hill — and perhaps some Democrats, too — will wonder just how far the Obama Justice Department officials went in the effort to stop Trump.""They should do much more than wonder.RELATED:Did A Corrupt FBI Give Hillary Clinton A Free Pass?

85,GPS,"A cascade of embarrassing details has poured out over the last few weeks on how special counsel Robert Mueller's staff is a gang of Democratic partisans with a rooting interest in Hillary Clinton in 2016. Mueller deputy Andrew Weissman even attended the doomed election-night Clinton ""victory party"" in New York.Those news items are pouring out from every direction except the ""news"" media.The network anchors can barely mention the fact that senior FBI agent Peter Strzok was removed from Mueller's team months ago for exchanging anti-Trump, pro-Hillary text messages with the woman with whom he was having an affair, who was another FBI official. Or that former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr met with ex-British spy Christopher Steele and the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS, which assembled a dossier of unverified dirt on President Trump. They're not outraged that Mueller and Justice Department officials have kept these facts from Congress. Mueller is stonewalling Congress; the media are stonewalling the public.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveIt's apparently distasteful to report that among the 15 Mueller lawyers, nine are Democratic donors — several of whom contributed to Clinton's 2016 campaign. Jeannie Rhee donated to Clinton and former President Obama and defended The Clinton Foundation against a racketeering lawsuit. Rhee even represented Clinton personally to prevent the release of her emails. Aaron Zebley represented Justin Cooper, the former Clinton aide who helped set up her private email server and destroyed several of her mobile devices to obstruct investigations.This information isn't disturbing to the ""objective"" media. Reporting it is. CNN host Don Lemon found it ""shocking"" that there has been a ""huge rise in anti-Mueller and FBI rhetoric from right-wing media recently."" This is how CNN greets facts it doesn't like: It says they are merely ""rhetoric"" from ideologues. They run against The Narrative.To see how The Narrative is concocted, see Time magazine's gushing tribute to Mueller in its Person of the Year issue — as if a June cover story titled ""The Lie Detector"" wasn't enough. In the issue, he's called ""A prosecutor known for rigor and rectitude goes after the president's men.""XTime's Massimo Calabresi gushed, ""the special counsel has held the country in his thrall"" with ""rare bipartisan support and a team of veteran cops and prosecutors."" Why, ""There is barely a handful of people in all of America with the reputation and experience to take on the task of untangling a multipronged Russian influence operation."" Mueller is snidely juxtaposed against ""the arrival in our nation's capital of a roguish figure elected on the exhilarating notion that rules are to be flouted.""This is how Democratic hacks write copy. Somehow, the Clintons have never been roguish figures who demonstrated that all the rules in their way would be ignored.On the criticism of Mueller's partisanship and stonewalling, Time says: ""The pressure has hurt the President more than the prosecutor. Mueller is a lifelong registered Republican."" There was no mention in its ridiculous puff piece of any Democratic partisanship on Mueller's staff. None at all.For contrast, recall Time's Men of the Year issue at the end of 1998. Back then, anti-Kenneth Starr commentary wasn't ""shocking."" It was mandatory. Time insisted Starr had engaged in a witch hunt and ""disastrously"" included stark sexual details in the Starr Report. The magazine responded to Clinton's impeachment with moral equivalence, saying: ""The more Starr pushed, the more Clinton stalled. And in the end, each drove the other to a kind of madness."" Time concluded that ""like Bill Clinton, he still dreams of being found not guilty.""But Time now insists Mueller is ""the personification of the idea that rule of law remains paramount."" There's a reason these ""news"" magazines have crumbled: They are only trustworthy if what you want to read is a Democratic National Committee talking-points memo.RELATED:The Trump-Russia 'Dossier' Scandal DeepensFBI, Mueller Investigation Of Trump Is Politicized — Shut It DownDid A Corrupt FBI Give Hillary Clinton A Free Pass?

Until August 31, 2016, with the presidential election in full swing, former FBI director James Comey gave the impression that he hadn't arrived at his decision to let Clinton off the hook until after he had all the facts.But in late August we learned that, in fact, Comey and his team began drafting his get-out-of-jail-free statement for Clinton in April — right around the time President Obama publicly declared Clinton innocent of any crimes, and well before the FBI had interviewed dozens of key witnesses, including Clinton herself.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThen, in early November, we learned that an early draft of that memo had accused Clinton of being ""grossly negligent"" in handling classified material because she used an unsecured private email server while Secretary of State.At some point during the editing process of that memo, ""grossly negligent"" became ""extremely careless,"" which is how Comey put it in the final version.The change was monumental. The criminal statute regarding mishandling classified material specifically cites ""gross negligence"" as a violation of the law, even if there is no intent involved. Had that language remained, Comey's claim that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would take the Clinton email case would have been laughable.So changing the language was obviously meant to clear the path for letting Clinton off the hook, whatever the facts might be.X This week, the other shoe in the memo story dropped, when it was reported that Peter Strzok had made that particular edit.Strzok, for those who don't know, had been kicked off the Trump/Russia investigation this summer — a fact we also only learned about in the past few days — after it turned out that he'd been sending anti-Trump, pro-Hillary texts to an FBI colleague.So the key person who made a material change in a memo exonerating Clinton was a big Clinton supporter and a Trump hater.On top of this, we only recently learned that officials at the FBI were in a frenzy after learning of Bill Clinton's off-the-books tarmac meeting with then Attorney General Loretta Lynch on June 27, 2016.But the FBI wasn't interested in finding out what was said at that highly suspicious and inappropriate confab. Nope. They wanted to know who leaked the information.""These new FBI documents show the FBI was more concerned about a whistleblower who told the truth about the infamous Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting than the scandalous meeting itself,"" said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, which uncovered the memos, adding that they ""show the FBI worked to make sure no more details of the meeting would be revealed to the American people.""Now, contrast all this with the way the FBI has been pursuing — since July 2016 — claims made in the Clinton-campaign-DNC-financed ""dossier"" supposedly showing that Trump colluded with Russian meddling in the presidential election.Before and after the election, the FBI has been ferociously investigating this, determined to find any shred of evidence that might support the dossier, and yet has come up empty. Now, under Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the entire focus seems to have shifted from providing any evidence of collusion to catching anyone in Trump's circle who committed unrelated crimes.We're not conspiracy mongers here. But it's hard to see this as anything other than an effort by the Deep State first to protect Hillary's election chances at all costs, and then, when that failed, to ruin Trump's presidency — at all costs.And people wonder why nobody trusts the government any more.RELATED:FBI, Mueller Investigation Of Trump Is Politicized — Shut It DownWill Shocking New Fusion GPS Revelations Take Down Hillary Clinton And DNC?Americans Want Special Counsel To Investigate Clinton Uranium Deal: IBD/TIPP PollMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

87,GPS,"Clinton Scandal: Americans overwhelmingly support the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the 2010 deal that gave Russia direct control over one-fifth of the U.S.' uranium, a new IBD/TIPP Poll shows.Of the 50% who said they were following the uranium story closely, 68% said they would like the ""Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to investigate the uranium deal with Russia,"" the poll's data indicated.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe convoluted deal involved a transaction in which Uranium One, a Canadian firm, was acquired by the Russian government-controlled nuclear monopoly Rosatom.But the deal had to be approved by the U.S. government, due to Uranium One's extensive holdings in the U.S. The acquisition sailed through, in part because Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave her strong approval.X However, it was later revealed that investors in Uranium One linked to Russia had given the Clinton Foundation more than $140 million in donations.As we wrote in October, ""while top Obama administration officials were deciding whether to hand over control of one-fifth of the nation's uranium supplies to Russia, the FBI had piles of evidence that officials at Rosatom were flagrantly violating U.S. laws and possibly compromising national security. The FBI also had evidence that officials had directed millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton's family charity, creating a clear conflict of interest.""Unfortunately, no one in the Obama administration let the public know all of this before the deal was approved. In fact, Hillary Clinton's role didn't come to light until she left the Secretary of State's office to run for president.As usual, there were partisan differences based on party affiliations, but support for a special counsel was strong.Even among Democrats, some 54% said a special counsel needed to look into the deal; 82% of Republicans said the same, as did 66% of independents. The support is broad and multipartisan.The poll also asked of respondents whether they ""believe that Russian donations to the Clinton Foundation played a role in the previous administration's decision to approve the uranium deal with Russia or not.""Here the answer again showed a majority answering yes, by 55% to 36%, with 9% saying they were unsure.But a much more pronounced partisan split was evident in the data, with only 24% of Democrats saying that donations to the Clinton Foundation played a role in the deal being approved, vs. 84% of Republicans and 53% of independents.While the 2010 deal may seem long ago, it is relevant today. Robert Mueller, who today heads the troubled investigation into the Donald Trump campaign and alleged meddling by the Russians in the 2016 presidential election, headed the FBI from 2000 to 2011.It's not clear why his office, which found evidence of egregious lawbreaking by the Russians, never publicized his findings or issued a warning about letting the deal go through.Recent revelations that key members of his current investigative team — in particular, FBI agent Peter Strzok, a veteran of both the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump investigations — held strongly anti-Trump views, as expressed in emails that have been made public.The IBD/TIPP Poll suggests strongly that this news has unsettled Americans and raised serious questions about the conduct of both Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. And, on a bipartisan basis, they'd like some answers.RELATED:IBD/TIPP PollWill Justice Investigate Hillary Clinton's Crimes In Uranium One-Fusion GPS Scandal?

91,GPS,"Saudi Arabia reportedly agreed to buy precision munitions from Boeing (BA) and Raytheon (RTN), but the $7 billion deal could get held up in Congress as lawmakers are concerned about civilian causalities in Riyadh's bombing campaigns in Yemen.XThe precision weapons orders are part of the $110 billion defense deal announced during President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May, sources told Reuters.The order has been in the works since 2015 and includes more than 8,000 Laser Guided Bombs, over 10,000 general purpose bombs, and more than 5,000 GPS guidance tail kits, according to Reuters.Boeing shares closed up 0.3% at 265.88 on the stock market today. Raytheon shares added 0.3%.The State Department must notify Congress of all weapons sales to foreign partners, and Congress approves any final deal.But U.S. lawmakers have faced a backlash as the civilian death toll in Yemen mounts. Saudi Arabia is leading a bombing campaign against Iran-backed Houthi rebels there.The U.N. said nearly 4,800 civilians have been killed since March 2015, Reuters reported. But Saudi Arabia denies involvement in the civilian causalities.Sen. Bob Corker, R- Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said earlier this year he would block weapon sales to Saudi Arabia and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council after the group broke diplomatic ties with U.S. ally Qatar.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Saudi Arabia in May had announced $110 billion in defense deals that were planned in the near term, with that total growing to $350 billion over 10 years.Lockheed Martin's (LMT) has said Saudi Arabia wants to buy more than $28 billion in ""integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs.""In addition to precision weapons, Boeing's haul from the Saudis include Chinook helicopters and the P-8 reconnaissance plane.But while Saudi Arabia is looking to buy more weapons, another top U.S. ally, the U.K., seems to be wavering on its purchase of Lockheed's F-35 joint strike fighter.Britain originally committed to buy 138 F-35s, but Lt. Gen. Mark Poffley, the deputy chief of the U.K. defense staff, said earlier this week that he was ""sympathetic"" to cutting that number due to budget concerns, according to an Aviation Week report.Lockheed shares finished 0.3% higher Friday.RELATED: Here's The Catch With The U.S.-Saudi Defense, Oil DealsLockheed: F-35 Growing By 'Leaps And Bounds' But Sales To Slow In 2018Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

93,GPS,"Scandal: Just as the FBI and Justice Department is telling Congress that they haven't been able to verify anything of importance in the Trump/Russia collusion dossier, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has decided to cast a much wider net in his fishing expedition. Is this a coincidence? Or is it a sign that Mueller also realizes there's no there there?XShortly after it came to light that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had secretly paid Fusion GPS to assemble the so-called Steele Dossier, which Fusion then tried to fob off on reporters before the election, the press dismissed this bombshell by saying that the source of its financing was irrelevant because much of the dossier ""checks out"" or has been ""proven to be accurate.""But according to the Washington Examiner's Byron York, FBI and Justice officials recently told congressional investigators that after spending nearly a year and a half looking into it, ""they have not been able to verify or corroborate the substantive allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign outlined in the Trump dossier.""In other words, they've failed to verify things like: the alleged meetings of Carter Page with the head of Russia's state-owned oil company and a top official in the Putin government; the alleged meeting between Michael Cohen and ""Kremlin representatives""; or any of the other specific claims in the dossier that weren't already public knowledge when it was written.Mueller's initial indictments suggested that he's had no better luck than the FBI.The charges Mueller filed at the end of October against Trump's short-lived campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had nothing whatsoever to do with election meddling. And low-level campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI not about whether he had contacts with people from Russia — which amounted to nothing — but about when those meetings occurred.As we noted at the time: ""This may be nothing more than a prosecutorial Hail Mary, thrown in desperation that something damning might be revealed.""What does Mueller do now? ABC News reports that he has requested ""a broad array of documents"" from Justice, not about collusion, but about whether the Trump administration did anything to obstruct the investigation that arguably never should have been launched in the first place.Mueller's investigators, according to ABC, want emails related to Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself. That includes emails sent within Justice, and any correspondence with White House officials.""The latest move suggests the Special Counsel is still actively digging into, among other matters, whether Trump or any other administration official improperly tried to influence an ongoing investigation,"" the story says.This could also be read as: Having failed to find any evidence of collusion, Mueller is now fishing around for something, anything, to justify the vast amount of resources being poured into his endless investigations.The mainstream press hasn't uncovered anything nefarious, either, despite spending a solid year looking for it. As we've noted in this space, all the bombshells they have breathlessly reported turned out to be duds, and much of what the press is now saying about the ""scandal"" is either wrong or exaggerated — such as that the dossier has been ""proven to be accurate.""So, let's recap: After nearly 16 months of investigating, the FBI and the Justice Department admit that they haven't been able to verify any of the most damaging Trump/Russia collusion claims in the DNC/Hillary Clinton financed dossier.Neither, apparently, has Mueller after six months of investigating.Nor has an army of investigative reporters who've been trying to prove the charges since November 9, 2016.Yet no one wants to let go of the story.With each passing day, this is looking less and less like a legitimate investigation and more like an attempt by the Washington establishment to stage a palace coup against a duly elected president.RELATED:Three More Trump/Russia 'Bombshells' Turn Out To Be Duds Deep State Run Amok?

94,GPS,"Stocks remained lower Friday afternoon, but Nike (NKE) and other apparel stocks showed the retail sector is far from dead.The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) jumped 2.6%, rising above a 200-day moving average that has been in decline this year. The sector has been struggling with online competition and changing consumer preferences. Those worries seemed overblown Friday as many clothing and shoe retailers rallied.Nike was one of the better stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. The sportswear giant gapped out of a cup-with-handle base with a 57.35 buy point.Surprisingly strong results from sports-apparel chains Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) seemed to boost Nike shares. Thinly traded Shoe Carnival (SCVL) was another industry member gapping up past a buy point. The stock soared 33% after the chain of sports and other footwear beat profit expectations. Same-store sales increased 4.4%.But the Dow lagged with a 0.4% loss as other components sputtered. Just three days after a promising breakout, Coca-Cola (KO) was more than 3% below the 47.08 buy point.The Nasdaq composite was flat while the S&P 500 eased 0.2%. Small caps led as the Russell 2000 added 0.6%. The index is gathering momentum after rising back above its 50-day moving average this week.Volume was running higher compared with the same time Thursday. Friday is an options expiration day, which tends to increase trading.Breadth was much better than the indexes suggested. Winners led losers by a 2-1 ratio on the NYSE and by 7-to-4 on the Nasdaq.The apparel and footwear retail industry group was one of Friday's best as it continued rising from the lower fourth of IBD's 197 industry rankings. It ranked 85 on Friday.Children's Place (PLCE) broke out of an undefined base, clearing a 125.40 buy point and resistance around 120. The chain beat quarterly expectations on Wednesday and shares have continued higher.Ross Stores (ROST) gapped up sharply, as it cleared a long consolidation in heavy trading following strong earnings. The stock receded from its morning peak at 73.94, trading near 71.60 in afternoon dealings.Gap (GPS) climbed above the 29.87 buy point of a large cup with handle in big volume, but dipped below the entry during afternoon trading. Late Thursday, the store chain beat estimates with October-quarter EPS of 58 cents and sales of $3.84 billion. Same-store sales rose 3%, also above views.Guess (GES) broke out of a flat base and was trading near the 174.64 buy point. Volume was 2-1/2 times more than average.A few other stocks in the group cleared resistance levels, though not necessarily proper buy points. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) leapt past resistance around 15 after the company's strong results.Other consumer stocks and the energy sector were leading, while transportation, utility and some technology groups were down the most.

95,GPS,"The major market indexes were lower Friday despite big gains from a number retailers including Foot Locker (FL) and Ross Stores (ROST).XSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) fell 0.4%, PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) gave up 0.3% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) dipped 0.2% in the stock market today. But emerging markets and small caps rallied as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) rose 0.7%, while iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) and iShares Russell 2000 (IJR) gained 0.5% each.Wal-Mart (WMT), Intel (INTC) and Coca-Cola (KO) weighed on the Dow with declines of about 2% apiece. But Nike (NKE) gapped up and leapt more than 3%, running past a 57.35 buy point of a cup with handle in above-average volume.Among sector funds, chips, utilities and real estate led the downside. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) fell nearly 2% from its Thursday record high. Applied Materials (AMAT) reported better-than-expected fiscal Q4 results and boosted its current-quarter guidance. Shares surged initially but reversed lower.Retail, energy and gold miners bucked the decline. SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) gapped up and rose almost 3% to retake its 200-day moving average for the first time in over two months.Retailers including Foot Locker, Hibbett Sports (HIBB) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) scored double-digit gains following their earnings reports.

Gold futures rose 1.3% to $1,2394.60 an ounce.Think hot stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and now Wal-Mart (WMT) are out of buy range?On an individual-stock basis, they are technically extended. But you can still gain access to such names via an exchange traded fund that holds those stocks and is itself in a buy zone. For instance, a solid rebound off the 50-day moving average can set up a potential buy opportunity for ETFs.Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company (FNDX) remains in buy range as it bounces off the support line. Shares advanced 5% from an early-September pullback to the 50-day line to their Nov. 7 intraday high.The $3.4 billion fund, launched in August 2013, tracks the Russell RAFI US Large Company Index. The index comprises big-cap companies that are weighted based on fundamental measures of size, including retained operating cash flow, adjusted sales and dividends plus buybacks. That tends to lead to stocks with more of a big-cap value tilt than those trading at higher valuations, according to Morningstar Direct.Information technology accounted for the biggest sector weighting as of Nov. 15 at about 17% of assets, followed by 14% each in financials and energy. Consumer discretionary represented 12%; health care and industrials made up roughly 11% apiece. The top 10 holdings included Exxon Mobil (XOM), Apple, Chevron (CVX), Microsoft and Wal-Mart, which soared 11% Thursday to a record high after Q3 earnings and sales beat analyst expectations.Apple had a fine day too, gaining 1.2% to end a five-day losing streak.

97,GPS,"The S&P 500 index was slightly lower for the week even as Dow components Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) skyrocketed on strong earnings and hopes that the titans will continue to transition into faster-growth markets. The Dow's General Electric (GE) tumbled as Wall Street isn't sold on its turnaround plan. Tesla (TSLA) unveiled new future vehicles even as it struggles to get the Model 3 out the door and General Motors (GM) ramps up its electric car goals. Chinese internet leaders Tencent (TCEHY), JD.com (JD), YY (YY) and NetEase (NTES) all had strong earnings reports.The S&P 500 index fell 0.1% for the week while the Dow lost 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5% after hitting an all-time high Thursday. Wal-Mart, Cisco, NetApp (NTAP), Applied Materials (AMAT) and several Chinese internets helped, along with some up-and-down movement on tax cuts. General Electric was a disappointment.Wal-Mart per-share earnings unexpectedly rose 2% to $1 a share on 4% sales growth to $123.18 billion, including e-commerce growth of 50%. Investors were pleased, sending shares up 10.9% on Thursday to a record high. On Wednesday, Target (TGT) offered up weak guidance for the ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter. The discounter did top Q3 forecasts with a 12.5% EPS fall to 91 cents and 1.4% sales rise to $16.67 billion. Shares tumbled below their 200-day line on Wednesday but regained that key level by the end of the week.New General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery offered up a plan to turn around the troubled industrial giant, but Wall Street found GE's strategic vision held little that was new or bold. GE will reduce its footprint to just three key divisions — aviation, power and health care. Flannery also halved the profit outlook for 2018 and GE's rich dividends. Investors sent GE shares to a nearly six-year low.Cisco Systems (CSCO) surged to a 17-year high after the computer networking giant said it expects December-quarter revenue to rise 1%-3%, the first year-over-year gain in nearly two years. Cisco forecast earnings of 59 cents a share at its midpoint of guidance vs. estimates of 58 cents. Cisco reported strong demand for its new Catalyst 9000 network switches. The new switches are part of Cisco's plan to grow recurring subscription revenue. Deferred revenue rose 10% in the latest quarter.NetApp (NTAP) reported revenue of $1.42 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $1.38 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at 81 cents per share, ahead of views for 69 cents. The data storage and networking company also raised its outlook for the December quarter. Shares soared.T.J. Maxx parent TJX fell short of revenue estimates with sales of $8.76 billion but met EPS views with a 10% rise to $1 a share. The midpoint of Q4 profit guidance fell short of current forecasts, sending shares lower. Off-price peer Ross Stores, meanwhile, easily topped views with 16% profit gains to 72 cents a share as revenue grew 8% to $3.33 billion. Comps of 4% beat views for 2%, and Ross raised Q4 comp outlook. Ross shares surged Friday.Gap (GPS) and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) rallied Friday on well-received Q3 reports from the apparel chains.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) bought more Apple (AAPL) shares in the third quarter and sold a huge share of its IBM (IBM) holdings, regulatory filings showed. The big investors clashed on the iPhone maker, which hit a record high in Q3. George Soros' Soros Fund Management dumped his entire stake, while David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital slashed its stake nearly in half, and David Tepper's Appaloosa doubled its stake. Outside tech, Berkshire kept faith with airlines. Soros loaded up consumer stocks.It was a good week or China internet companies as five of them reported quarterly results that all topped estimates. The big winner was YY (YY), a provider of livestreaming services. YY reported revenue of $464.8 million, smashing the consensus estimate of $423 million. Shares soared more than 20%. Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), a leader in gaming and messaging, saw its shares approach a new high on its quarterly results. China e-commerce company JD.com (JD) got a boost as well, as did 58.com (WUBA), called the Craigslist of China. Mobile gaming specialist NetEase (NTES) trounced earnings views, sending shares surging nearly 8% Thursday and almost 13% on Friday.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY)  earned an adjusted 78 cents a share in its third quarter, up 30% year over year, on sales of $9.32 billion, up 4%. But analysts expected 79 cents and $9.35 billion. Best Buy blamed the delayed launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone X and hurricanes in Texas and Florida for the Q3 disappointment. For the holiday quarter, Best Buy expects to earn $1.94 a share on sales of $14.35 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling for EPS of $2.03 on sales of $14.36 billion.Semiconductor-equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT) beat fiscal fourth quarter sales and earnings targets and guided higher for the current quarter. Its stock climbed to a record high on the news, finally eclipsing its previous record reached in April 2000 during the dot-com bubble. Another chip-gear stock getting a lift from a positive earnings report was Kulicke & Soffa Industries (KLIC). Also, semiconductor-equipment firm Lam Research (LRCX) got a boost after announcing a $2.3 billion capital return program.Biotechs were relatively beat up last week with a few key exceptions. Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX) continued taking hits Monday, diving nearly 10% on data in a pancreatic cancer trial using its drug, cabiralizumab, with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) blockbuster Opdivo. Pacira Pharmaceuticals (PCRX) lost 6.6% Tuesday after the Food and Drug Administration set a date for an advisory committee to discuss its drug, Exparel, as a regional anesthetic. Also Tuesday, Loxo Oncology (LOXO) led a biotech deluge as stocks broadly lost 1.9% after it agreed to codevelop two cancer drugs with Bayer (BAYRY) in a $1.55 billion deal. On Wednesday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) dipped to a five-month low after reporting five deaths in its late-stage Parkinson's disease studies. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) defied the trend, though, and rose to a nearly 17-year high Monday on a promising trial of its drug, NKTR-214, with Bristol's Opdivo in skin, kidney and lung cancers.Tesla (TSLA) unveiled an all-electric Semi truck with a higher-than-expected 500-mile battery range as well as a next-generation Roadster sports car. CEO Elon Musk said the new truck will start production in 2019, though Tesla has struggled with deadlines. In the meantime, JB Hunt (JBHT) and others plunked down $5,000 reservations, offering cash-burning Tesla more capital for its Model 3 rollout. Tesla shares rose a fraction Friday. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) plans to sell 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026. That aggressive new target hinges on a next-gen EV platform by 2021, with less costly batteries.Inflation appears to be firming, but hurricane recovery may be playing a role, new Labor Department data suggested. Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8% from a year ago, with an annualized 2.4% gain over the past three months. Rent inflation has been behind the recent strength, but used car prices also bounced in October, likely a temporary effect of demand created when hurricanes Harvey and Irma destroyed hundreds of thousands of vehicles.While all evidence suggests the economy is on something of a roll, retail sales moderated after surging an upwardly revised 1.9% in September. The overall 0.2% gain edged past expectations, but came in on the weak side outside of autos with a 0.1% rise.Emirates announced an order for 40 Boeing (BA) 787-10s, valued at $15.1 billion at list prices, instead of the expected Airbus (EADSY) A380 order. Boeing also inked an order for 175 737 Max jets from discount carrier FlyDubai. Airbus had a surprise of its own, shocking industry watchers with a $49.5 billion order for 273 A320neo jets and 157 A321neos from U.S. investor Indigo Partners, the largest in Airbus' history. Even Bombardier (BDRBF) signed an order for its struggling CSeries line at the show. Boeing said the Middle East will need 3,350 new airplanes over the next 20 years, valued at $730 billion, up from its 2015 market outlook of 3,180 new planes.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) reported third-quarter earnings and sales that beat estimates. But the struggling retailer said earnings per share next year could fall by as much as 20%, citing flat same-store sales and plans to spend money on e-commerce, private brands and other investments. Dick's shares fell Tuesday but rose for teh week. However, Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) reported better-than-expected earnings, sending their shares soaring Friday. Mall-based Foot Locker said inventories are falling, good news for Nike (NKE). Hibbett Sports cited strong online sales, and raised full-year guidance.U.S. crude output hit a new high of 9.645 million barrels per day from a 9.62 million bpd in the week-ago report, the Energy Information Administration said. Stockpiles increased by 1.9 million barrels. Analysts expected a drop of 1 million barrels. In its World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency estimated that U.S. output would jump 25% — to 30 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 24 million currently. But the IEA also cut its 2017 and 2018 oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day. U.S. crude futures fell slightly for the week.RH (RH), the upscale furniture retailer formerly known as Restoration Hardware gave preliminary Q3 earnings figures that were well above estimates and other guided 2018 revenue estimates higher. Shares soared 26% on Thursday. But upscale home furnishings chain Williams-Sonoma (WSM) tumbled 13% Friday on weak earnings.Data services provider Splunk (SPLK) reported third-quarter results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, with a revenue forecast above expectations, sending shares up 18% on Friday.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) shares zoomed nearly 24% on Tuesday on the previous evening's after-hours Wall Street Journal report that private-equity firm Roark Capital had offered over $2.3 billion, or $150 a share, for the restaurant chain.Wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) rejected an unsolicited acquisition offer by Broadcom (AVGO), saying the proposed $130 billion deal undervalues the company. Broadcom was undeterred and indicated it could take its proposal directly to shareholders.Square (SQ) said it's in trials with a Bitcoin service that lets users of its Square Cash money-transfer app buy and sell the digital currency via an exchange.

100,GPS,"On Oct. 24, the Washington Post reported that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee hired the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on Donald Trump. The firm then retained former British intelligence operative Christopher Steele, who assembled a dubious dossier (complete with rumors of encounters with prostitutes) with information from his Russian contacts.Breaking news? Hardly. It has all but disappeared.This should have seriously undermined months of wildly speculative reporting on the Trump campaign seeking dirt on Clinton from the Russians, as well as the Democrats' warning of ""treason."" Even with the indictment of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, there's still not a scintilla of evidence of Russia-Trump collusion. But looking like hypocrites for deeply indulging in a double standard never slows these ""news"" reporters down.The Daily Caller hints at a deeper angle, and it calls into question the media's sermons on transparency. CNN justice correspondent Evan Perez hyped the dossier, but Perez and CNN never told viewers that Perez worked closely with the founders of Fusion GPS for years at a previous job.Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS co-founder ""most often associated with the dossier,"" worked on the same reporting staff as Perez at The Wall Street Journal, and they regularly co-authored stories.Peter Fritsch, another Fusion co-founder, worked above Simpson and Perez as the Journal's senior national security editor.A third co-founder, Tom Catan, was also a Wall Street Journal reporter in the same time frame. The Daily Caller showed Facebook photos of these men still going to baseball games and taking fishing vacations together.CNN's anti-Trump stories have hidden all this behind a wall of ""anonymous sources."" This is one dreadfully serious reason why the American people don't trust investigative reporting: In reality, it looks like a series of chummy handoffs funded by Trump opponents.""Pro-Clinton political activism"" and ""news reporting"" are one and the same. ""News"" is being assembled and colored by personal transactions between old friends and/or political allies. There's a lot of horse trading and glad-handing in the ""news"" process that they hide through their opaque sourcing techniques.To be fair and balanced on this ethical front, the conservative Washington Free Beacon website also retained Fusion GPS for research — for a few months before the Clinton campaign and the DNC — and The Daily Caller says it had reported on Fusion GPS without acknowledging a relationship.For decades now, campaigns have been ravenous for opposition research — combing over decades of a candidate's policy positions, speeches and personal behavior; looking for something damaging that could change a political trajectory. Candidates and political parties pay for it, but the investigative reporters are also doing it.In the Trump era, ""reporting"" and ""opposition research"" have become one and the same. The Clinton campaign and the DNC paid former reporters to find a gold mine in Russia. Why go to the expense? Hundreds of liberal reporters have helped the Democrats at no charge. The public needs to be skeptical about just how ethical they are in organizing scoops behind the scenes.RELATED:Mueller's Indictment Of Manafort: Desperate Prosecutorial Hail Mary, Or Trap For Trump?Who's Actually Guilty Of Colluding With Putin — Trump Or The Democrats?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

102,GPS,"Get ready for a word problem.Paul Manafort was Donald Trump's presidential campaign chairman. He allegedly had deep, long-lasting, corrupt ties to Russia for which he will likely go to prison if convicted — he's just been indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller.According to the indictment, he contracted with the Podesta Group — headed by Tony Podesta, a longtime Democratic lobbyist and brother of former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta — to run interference for the Ukrainian government under now-deposed leader Viktor Yanukovych. Podesta stepped down from the group on Monday amid the Manafort allegations.Meanwhile, former Trump campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos just pled guilty to lying to the FBI. He admits that he was attempting to connect with foreign sources with connections to the Russian government who promised a better Trump campaign-Russia relationship and stated they had ""dirt"" on Clinton, including ""thousands of emails.""Papadopoulos implicated other members of the campaign. This would be the second piece of evidence that someone in the Trump campaign was warm toward receiving information on Clinton via Russian sources. The first came earlier this year, when we found out that Donald Trump Jr. had openly encouraged a meeting with Russia-connected lawyers promising material on Clinton. Neither reach-out by the Russians apparently materialized into anything serious.At the same time, we now know that Clinton's campaign paid Fusion GPS to fund an anti-Trump dossier compiled by one Christopher Steele, a former MI6 spy. Steele gathered information from Russian officials as well. This means that the Clinton campaign wasn't averse to gathering information from Russia to hurt Trump. And the FBI apparently founded a wiretap of a Trump associate on material in the Steele dossier.We don't know whether the charges in the Steele dossier were independently confirmed. But former FBI Director James Comey filled Trump in on them in January, while the FBI was interviewing Papadopoulos. And Trump fired Comey in May and then told Russian officials he had done so in order to relieve pressure on himself. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had already recused himself from Russian matters, which forced Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to consider recusing himself and appoint special counsel Robert Mueller, who had worked with Comey at the FBI.So, here's the question: Who's guilty? Not of Russian interference but being terrible at the business of government.The answer: Everyone.President Trump was elected on the basis of a promise to ""drain the swamp."" But Trump was always part of the swamp. Of course, some of the swamp was of his own making — he has hung out in dicey circles his entire career. But some of it came from the Republican National Committee — Manafort was heavily connected there. And Clinton was part of the swamp for decades, too, which is why Trump's campaign manager was working with the brother of Clinton's campaign manager to push a pro-Russian agenda for years.The American people saw the levels of corruption in Washington, D.C., and they responded by saying they wanted an outsider to clean things up. But things will never be clean so long as D.C. remains a central hoarding house for cash and power. The problem isn't Trump or Manafort or Podesta.The problem is that Washington, D.C., was never supposed to be this way, and that the flies have been drawn to the cesspool. If you want to ""drain the swamp,"" you have to start with the institutions themselves, not with the people. The problem isn't having the worst people running the government; it's having the worst forms of government drawing the worst people.RELATED:Mueller's Indictment Of Manafort: Desperate Prosecutorial Hail Mary, Or Trap For Trump?Who's Actually Guilty Of Colluding With Putin — Trump Or The Democrats?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

104,GPS,"Scandal: Here's a thought experiment. What if Russia's goal in its machinations before the November election wasn't to get President Trump elected, but to sow discord and dissent in the U.S.? If that's the case, Russia's investment has paid off handsomely, and blame for that rests not with Trump, but his political enemies.In an interview with Politico, Obama administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that ""The Russians succeeded, I believe, beyond their wildest expectations. Their first objective in the election was to sow discontent, discord and disruption in our political life, and they have succeeded to a fare-thee-well.""He went on to say ""they have accelerated, amplified the polarization and the divisiveness in this country, and they've undermined our democratic system. They wanted to create doubt in the minds of the public about our government and about our system, and they succeeded to a fare-thee-well.""The more we learn about what Russia's meddling, the more it looks like Clapper is right about Russia's intentions — that it wasn't so much about electing Trump as it was turning the country against itself.On YouTube, Russians developed a ""Don't Shoot Me"" campaign meant to stoke racial tensions using Pokémon Go as a platform. A Russian Facebook page called ""the United Muslims of America"" shared posts and videos about American Islamophobia. Another Facebook page, called ""Blacktivist,"" ran ""denunciations of the criminal justice system and viral videos of police violence,"" according to the New York Times.None of this makes much sense if Russia was simply trying to get Trump elected. Why would they try to energize the Democratic base? But the actions make perfect sense if the goal was to destabilize the country.Even the infamous Russian dossier apparently wasn't an intelligence official's reporting on what Trump and Russia were up to, but a political hit job paid for by the Clinton campaign, that Russians apparently assisted with, and that the company involved — Fusion GPS — tried desperately to shop to the press before the election. (Talk about meddling.)""If any part of the Steele dossier is accurate, Russia was playing both sides of the fence,"" notes Real Clear Politics Washington bureau chief Carl Cannon. ""But why?""Maybe, he says, ""Vladimir Putin's goal is simply setting Americans at one another's throats.""If so, it was arguably one of the best investments Putin has ever made. Look at what he's managed to achieve by employing a few hackers and putting up some fake Facebook pages.But who can take credit for handing Putin that victory?Trump has been denying accusations of any collusion with Russia all along, and tried to put it behind him. Even with the special counsel Robert Mueller's indictments, nothing has been brought to light to contradict Trump, nor has any evidence been presented that Russia was able to sway any actual votes.It was the Clinton campaign, however, that decided the day after the election to blame their loss on Russian meddling and implicate Trump as being part of it. The press has gladly fed this controversy for 10 months with half-baked stories and wild speculation. Public vitriol on both sides has reached fever pitches. And, as Clapper noted, American's trust in their institutions has suffered a serious blow.No wonder Democrats and the press don't want to allow any other motive on Russia's part. Because doing so implicates them, not Trump, as colluding with Putin's campaign to destabilize the U.S.RELATED:Clinton Emails, Trump Dossier, Russian Nukes: All Point To Corruption In Obama's Justice DepartmentTrump-Russia Collusion Is Fake News — Fire Mueller, And End This Bogus InvestigationDeep State Run Amok?

106,GPS,"Russian Scandal: Special Counsel Robert Mueller has a tough job. After all, how can you prove allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials to influence our 2016 presidential election when, from all evidence after a year and a half of investigation, it didn't happen?Naming Mueller to head the investigation was a huge error. His investigation should be shut down and Mueller sent home.X This week's stunning revelation that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee funded the fake Trump/Putin dossier, filled with outright lies, exaggerations and misleading information, is the final straw.For it shows that not only were Hillary Clinton, the DNC and her lawyer, Marc Elias, lying when they denied any involvement in the phony dossier, it showed that they — not Trump — were deeply, perhaps criminally, compromised by collusion with Russian officials.In Hillary's case, in 2009 she promised the Russians a ""reset,"" and then over the next two years proceeded to help them build their own mini-Silicon Valley with U.S. funding and expertise, and approved the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian company that controls 20% of U.S.-based uranium supplies, to Russia's state-owned nuclear monopoly, Rosatom.If that isn't dizzying enough, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, her husband former President Bill Clinton, and their Clinton Foundation charity took in millions of dollars from Russian entities and the grateful executives of Uranium One, who were taken over by the deep-pocketed Russians. It was a classic example of illegal pay-for-play, and yet neither President Obama's Justice Department nor his FBI found anything wrong with it.Fast forward to 2016, and Hillary and the DNC retained Fusion GPS to dig up dirt on Donald Trump. Fusion then hired former British spook Christopher Steele, a man who, as former head of the Moscow desk for Britain's MI6 intelligence agency, has deep espionage ties in Russia, to do ""research"" on Trump. What they got instead was innuendo, half-truths, distortions, exaggerations and just plain gossip — much of it from Russian ""sources.""And yet, this phantasmagorical bit of research became the basis for a full-blown investigation of the Trump campaign's supposed ties to Russian officials and their interference in the 2016 presidential election.With each new revelation in recent weeks, it has become ever clearer that the collusion that took place wasn't on the part of Trump, but Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, who have been playing a double-game with the Russians since at least Obama's first term. That's the real collusion here. Typical of how the progressive left works, they have accused their opponent of the very thing they are guilty of: colluding with a possible enemy.This is where Robert Mueller comes in. Mueller himself was head of the FBI from 2001 to 2013. But from 2009 to 2013, all sorts of alarms were going off over the apparent influence peddling by Hillary Clinton while serving as secretary of state. The Justice Department, headed by die-hard leftist lawyer and Obama loyalist Eric Holder, did nothing. Nor did Mueller.Fast forward to 2016. Mueller's successor at the FBI, James Comey, did do something: He paid Fusion GPS, which received funding from Russian sources, for its bogus ""research"" on Trump. That research also became the basis for the equally bogus investigation headed by Mueller.Yet, as we said earlier in the week, it's now clear that the real Russian collusion was among Hillary and Bill Clinton, their Clinton Foundation, the DNC, Democratic operatives and bagmen John and Tony Podesta, Fusion GPS and James Comey. Not Trump and his campaign confederates.When a legal mistake of this magnitude is made, it must be undone. That's just what Congress is doing right now.In recent days, both houses of Congress have unveiled investigations into the Uranium One deal and possible pay-for-play deals at Hillary Clinton's State Department and her family Clinton Foundation.Just Thursday, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican, called for naming a special counsel for the Uranium One deal and the related financial shenanigans. He's on solid ground here: In a new Rasmussen poll, 51% of likely voters said they believe ""it's likely that Bill and Hillary Clinton or their close political associates broke the law in their dealings with Russia.""In the meantime, however, the purely political investigation of Trump led by Mueller since the start of this year has gone nowhere. It should be ended immediately, and not just because they've found nothing or that the original basis for the investigation has been tainted by being funded by the Democrats, FBI and Russians.We have nothing personal against Mueller, who led the FBI's shift toward counterterrorism in the immediate years after 9/11. But as special counsel, Mueller has conflicts all over the place, including his personal ties to Comey (who was Mueller's favorite to succeed him at the FBI in 2013) and by the fact that he headed the FBI during the time that Hillary was engaged in soliciting donations, selling access to the office of the secretary of state, and officially approving the highly questionable Uranium One deal.In addition, the very premise of the Russian investigation has been proven faulty, based almost entirely (at least initially) on a politically motivated opposition-research operation run by the Democrats against Trump, and later picked up by the FBI's Comey. Based on this, it's time to let special counsel Robert Mueller go, and dismantle the Russian investigation he leads.RELATED:Clinton Foundation Scandal Deep State Run Amok?

107,GPS,"Trump Dossier: The question swirled for months around Washington, D.C., like a dirty whirlwind: Who paid for the now infamous, largely spurious campaign ""dossier"" of background innuendo, half-truths and rumors about Donald Trump that made its way into the hands of the media and served as a basis for U.S. intelligence agencies' surveillance of the Trump campaign?We now know, and the answer should surprise no one: The Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, according to a report in the Washington Post. The newspaper said that, starting in April of 2016, Clinton attorney Mark Elias paid a ""research firm,"" Fusion GPS, for opposition research on Trump. Fusion subsequently hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy with known ties to the U.S. intelligence community and to the Russians, to dig up dirt on the billionaire candidate for the dossier.As the Post reported, Elias and his firm, Seattle-based Perkins Coie, got paid $5.6 million in legal fees from the Clinton campaign from June 2015 to December 2016. It was a highly lucrative legal gig, and a vital part of the Clinton campaign. In comments to the media, the Democrats, the Clinton campaign and Elias denied categorically and repeatedly any involvement by the Clinton campaign or DNC in the Fusion GPS anti-Trump dossier.He lied. And so did Hillary Clinton.Further confusing the matter is that Fusion GPS worked with the Russian government starting in 2012 to reverse the Magnitsky Act, bipartisan sanctions put in place against a number of Russian officials in response to the imprisonment and subsequent brutal beating death of Sergei Magnitsky. And it hired Steele, who was as they say ""connected"" to Russian officials. So, unlike Trump, Hillary's opposition research firm literally was colluding with the Russians.The tainted Clinton-Fusion dossier containing alleged scandalous behavior that came from questionable Russian sources was widely circulated, becoming the basis for much of the media's salacious reporting on Trump during the 2016 campaign.But it wasn't just the media that used it. Of far greater importance is how the FBI and other spy agencies used the dossier for their own investigations.More specifically, as Washington Examiner columnist Byron York wondered, ""Did the FBI or other agencies use any information from the dossier as a basis for warrant requests before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court?""It sure looks that way. And if the answer is ""yes,"" it will have major ramifications. After all, by law U.S. intelligence agencies aren't allowed to meddle in our elections.The dossier seems to be the centerpiece of both former FBI chief James Comey's and current special counsel Robert Mueller's investigations into Russian ties to the Trump campaign. But other intelligence agencies apparently viewed it, too. So did President Obama.Were they operating together to get Hillary Clinton elected over the suddenly threatening maverick candidacy of Donald Trump?More to the point, was this a massive deep-state operation to undercut and perhaps take down Donald Trump? Was special counsel Robert Mueller, tasked earlier this year to investigate the Trump campaign's ties to the Russians, hired not to find the truth but to deliver a legal coup de grace to Trump's still-young presidency?The Washington Post reported last February that the British ex-spy Steele, the former head of British MI-6's Russia desk and a former field agent in Moscow, had ""reached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him to continue his work."" Did the FBI become, in essence, an adjunct to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, by picking up where its opposition research left off?And how much did Russian officials contribute to the dossier? Were the FBI and the DNC knowingly operating in cahoots with Russian officials?The answers matter. It's flat-out illegal for a U.S. intelligence agency to act on behalf of one candidate against another in a U.S. election. That's real meddling, the criminal kind.The possible involvement of intelligence agencies in our election on behalf of one candidate is uncharted territory, the stuff of bad spy fiction. If it's true, and current investigations in the Senate and House should get to the bottom of all this, then someone ought to go to prison for a spell.The questions are many. Unfortunately, the possibility that crimes were committed by our own government means that both former FBI chief James Comey and special counsel Robert Mueller have irreconcilable conflicts of interest. Mueller should be removed, and both men's future in this sordid scandal should be limited to one, and only one, role: Witness.It's time to push the real ""reset button"" on this whole bogus Russian investigation and look at the real collusion that seems to have existed between the Democrats, the Clinton campaign, the FBI and the Russians.RELATED:Clinton Foundation Scandal Why Is The Press Ignoring The Exploding Clinton-Russia-FBI Scandal? A Crime Or Just 'Baloney'?

108,GPS,"Obama Scandals: It was just 10 months ago that Barack Obama was bragging about how scandal-free his administration was. And many believed it, until now. Revelations are coming fast and furious pointing to political corruption at the Justice Department while he was in the White House.In the span of just the past few weeks, four major stories broke that implicate either the Justice Department or the FBI using their authority to help Democrats.Exonerating Clinton before the facts were in. First was the fact that former FBI director James Comey had, contrary to what he told Congress, drafted what amounted to an acquittal letter for Hillary Clinton months before he'd even interviewed her regarding her unsecured private email server.Comey interviewed Clinton on July 2, 2016, and three days later announced that he was closing the case because ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would pursue it.X In testimony before Congress in late September, however, Comey claimed that ""the decision was made after that (interview), because I didn't know what was going to happen in that interview. She maybe lied in the interview in a way we could prove.""But emails now show that Comey was drafting his statement way back in early May — two months before he interviewed Hillary and well before the department had completed its investigation.When this fact came to light, former assistant director at the FBI Chris Swecker told Newsweek magazine ""That is just not how things operate. ... It's built-in our DNA not to prejudge investigations, particularly from the top."" So why did Comey do the opposite?Setting up a liberal slush fund. Next, we learned that Justice was using settlement money as a slush fund to support liberal groups, to the explicit exclusion of any non-liberal ones. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte released what he called ""smoking gun"" emails to that effect.Under Obama, the Justice department started sending money from legal settlements to third parties not involved directly in the litigation. At the time, there were lots of complaints (including in this space) that the money was being poured into left-wing groups. And Trump ended the practice when he took office.Goodlatte, however, obtained emails showing that Justice made sure to exclude conservative groups from getting any of the billions of dollars in settlement cash that it was passing out.In July 2014, a senior Justice Department official warned his colleagues to avoid giving any money from a Citigroup settlement to ""conservative property-rights legal services.""""Aiding their political allies was only the half of it,"" Goodlatte said. Under Obama, Justice ""went out of its way to exclude conservative groups.""Papering over the Uranium One scandal. We've also only recently learned, thanks to intrepid reporters at The Hill, that the FBI had a substantial amount of evidence showing that Russian nuclear officials had been involved in a number of illegal schemes designed to expand its nuclear business in the U.S. — which included bribery, extortion and racketeering.Worse, they had all this before top Obama administration officials — including Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder — signed off on a deal that gave Russia effective control of 20% of uranium in the U.S. by approving Russia's purchase of Uranium One.Why didn't the FBI clang the warning bells before the administration signed off on that deal? Well, it just happens that doing so would have been hugely embarrassing for Obama and Clinton, who were busy at the time making nice with the Russians with their ""reset."" Did the FBI put politics ahead of law enforcement?Using Democratic-sponsored Russian dirt on Trump. Now that we know the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee — despite repeated denials — financed the so-called Trump dossier, a bigger question arises.What did the FBI know and when did they know it?Despite being labeled as ""salacious and unverified"" by former FBI director James Comey, it has served as a road map for journalists and federal investigators pushing the Trump-Russia meddling story.The Washington Examiner's Byron York clearly spelled out the issue raised by the revelation that the dossier was bought and paid for by Clinton Democrats:""Sometime in October 2016 — that is, at the height of the presidential campaign — Christopher Steele, the foreign agent hired by Fusion GPS to compile the Trump dossier, approached the FBI with information he had gleaned during the project. According to a February report in the Washington Post, Steele 'reached an agreement with the FBI a few weeks before the election for the bureau to pay him to continue his work.'It was an astonishing turn: the nation's top federal law enforcement agency agreeing to fund an ongoing opposition research project being conducted by one of the candidates in the midst of a presidential election.""In the end, the FBI didn't pay Steele, but as York notes, the question remains: ""Did the FBI or other agencies use any information from the dossier as a basis for warrant requests before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court?""House Republicans announced this week that they've started a probe into the FBI's handling of both the Clinton email case and the Uranium One deal. Now they have a fresh angle on the dossier to pursue.This is a good start. The Justice Department is supposed to be above politics. Obama tried to turn it into a political tool. The public needs to know how far he got.RELATED:Clinton Foundation Scandal Why Is The Press Ignoring The Exploding Clinton-Russia-FBI Scandal? A Crime Or Just 'Baloney'?

109,GPS,"Russia & Election 2016: Fast-moving rumors over the weekend — actually, illegal leaks to CNN from special counsel Robert Mueller's office — were confirmed Monday after Donald Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was indicted on 12 charges stemming from his ties to Russia. A disaster for Trump? Not yet. In fact, the indictment carefully avoids mention of either Trump or his campaign.Mueller's charges involve Manafort's and junior business partner Rick Gates' work on behalf of Russian-linked officials going all the way back to 2006. That's when, as the Washington Post has reported, Manafort was pulling in a cool $10 million a year as an advisor to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire associate of Vladimir Putin. Manafort later served as a political advisor to pro-Russian Ukrainian politician Viktor Yanukovych, who in 2010 became the president of Ukraine.Manafort's ties to Russia are long and deep, no doubt. But they have nothing to do with Donald Trump, or his campaign.Trump employed Manafort for all of four months in 2016, before firing him after it was revealed that Manafort had received more than $12 million in cash payments from a Ukrainian political party from 2007 to 2012. It's those four months that Mueller was hired to investigate.Not only did there appear to be no Trump link to any of Manafort's Russian activities, but he fired Manafort as soon as he found out about his ties. Does that sound like ""collusion""?""From President Trump's perspective, the indictment is a boon from which he can claim that the special counsel has no actionable collusion case,"" wrote former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy in National Review. ""It appears to reaffirm former FBI director James Comey's multiple assurances that Trump is not a suspect. And, to the extent it looks like an attempt to play prosecutorial hardball with Manafort, the president can continue to portray himself as the victim of a witch hunt.""Yet, Mueller's decision to indict Manafort and Gates follows a time-honored prosecutorial strategy: Indict the little fish (Manafort and Gates), and after threatening them with hard time in prison and massive fines, get them to snitch on the big fish (Trump).Based on that, should Trump be worried?The answer is: Only if he did something wrong — and, as of right now, after nearly a year and a half of investigation, there's zero evidence that he did. This may be nothing more than a prosecutorial Hail Mary, thrown in desperation that something damning might be revealed.If Trump shouldn't be worried, who should?The obvious answer is Bill and Hillary Clinton. After all, in 2010, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton approved of the takeover of nuclear materials company Uranium One by the Russian state-owned nuclear monopoly Rosatom. The deal gave Russia control of an estimated 20% of the U.S.' domestic uranium resources.What's unusual about this, beyond the obvious national security questions, is that about the same time as the deal was being approved by Hillary, officials and investors with ties to Uranium One and Rosatom were giving an estimated $145 million to the Clinton Foundation ""charity,"" while another Vladimir Putin-linked group was paying Bill Clinton $500,000 to deliver a speech in Moscow.Highly curious, to say the least.Nor was it all. As we wrote last year, Hillary also developed a sudden strong support for the Skolkovo technology center, a mini-Silicon Valley clone outside of Moscow. She got the backing from U.S. high-tech industrialists, investors and tech giants for the project — among them, Google, Cisco and Intel — which was intended to help Russia develop its own already-considerable technology capabilities.A case of altruism or nurturing our budding ""post-reset"" ties to Russia? Hardly. Of the 28 companies that took part, 17 were donors to the Clinton Foundation or paid for Bill Clinton speeches. Another case of Hillary and Bill making money from their official duties.Of interest is that, during this time, roughly 2009 and 2010, the FBI had discovered that the Russian state nuclear company, Rosatom, had conducted a campaign of bribery, racketeering, extortion and money laundering in its effort to win influence and control over U.S. nuclear assets. The FBI chose not to disclose this, even as Hillary approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom.The FBI director when all this happened: Robert Mueller.Yet, Mueller, now reincarnated as special prosecutor, went after Trump's former campaign manager, Manafort. Fair enough. If Manafort broke the law, he broke the law.But how about the Clintons, who seem to have run their family charity as a shakedown operation for foreign billionaires?Or John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chief? He held a seat on the board of a small energy company that included several Russia officials. That company took in some $35 million from a Russian government investment fund tied to Putin. And Podesta somehow forgot to fully disclose his ties to the firm, a clear violation of the law.Podesta also denied any knowledge of funding for Fusion GPS, the group whose opposition research ""dossier"" on Trump has served as the template for Mueller's investigation. Fusion GPS has been in part funded by the Russians, and much of the information in its now discredited dossier was provided by top Russian officials. Now that it has been revealed that the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for the dossier, it may be time for Podesta to reveal what he knows once again — under oath.Then there's Tony Podesta, John's brother, who also has deep ties to the Democrats, the Clintons and the Russians. In a bizarre twist, Manafort actually worked with Podesta on some Russian matters. Meanwhile, it's notable that Tony Podesta suddenly announced Monday that he is resigning from the Podesta Group. Maybe he wants to spend more time with his family, but given the timing we doubt it.The point is, there appears to be two laws in effect here: One for Trump and Republicans, the other for the Clintons and Democrats. Because of this, we first made our call for the Russian investigation to be disbanded last summer. Mueller's investigation was an obvious political fishing expedition. That's still true today.RELATED:Clinton Emails, Trump Dossier, Russian Nukes: All Point To Corruption In Obama's Justice DepartmentTrump-Russia Collusion Is Fake News — Fire Mueller, And End This Bogus InvestigationDeep State Run Amok?

116,GPS,"DETROIT — Bending metal, slapping on chrome and marketing an empowering product and status marker that mesmerized 20th-century America, the automobile industry typified the Old Economy, of which General Motors was emblematic. As was its bankruptcy. Today, GM's CEO Mary Barra is wagering that the industry soon will be manufacturing New Economy products. They will incorporate technologies that will entice buyers whose sensibilities and expectations have been shaped by the kind of empowerment delivered by their smartphones, which arrived just 10 years ago.GM's electric self-starter, which replaced hand cranks, was the last century's most transformative innovation. It arrived in 1912. Today, Cadillac offers hands-free driving, with advanced GPS mapping. An eye-tracking camera on the steering column monitors driver alertness, and the car nags the distracted driver back to attentiveness, which makes this technological marvel less of a convenience than the self-starter. Still, Barra is attempting an audacious balance between the demands of present consumers and radically different future demands. Or, more accurately, a future that governments, hostile to consumer sovereignty, intend to dictate.China has announced, as have Britain and France, plans to ban, at an undetermined date, sales of vehicles powered by fossil fuels in their tanks. (Electric vehicles will be powered mostly by fossil-fuel-generated electricity.) In Shanghai in mid-September, Barra dissented: ""I think it works best when, instead of mandating, consumers, not government dictates, should decide how cars are powered."" But governments, and not just dictatorships, like to dictate, and companies must accommodate: GM sells more cars in China than in America (it sold about 1.2 million Buicks last year, about a million of them in China, where elites drove them decades before communism arrived), and China manufactures more cars than the United States and Japan combined. As GM promises two new electric vehicles in the next 18 months, and a total of 20 by 2023, one of Barra's executives speaks of GM ""driving increased usage and acceptance of electric vehicles,"" but governments are at the wheel. Without subventions from Washington, Tesla's market capitalization never would have even briefly exceeded GM's.Barra foresees a fast-unfolding future of ""zero crashes"" (salvation through software: auto-crash fatality rates are rising for the first time in years, and 94% of crashes are caused by human error), ""zero emissions"" (zero from tailpipes, much from smokestacks in an all-electric future) and ""zero congestion"" (with more ride-hailing services and car-sharing fleets, less individual car ownership and less urban land devoted to parking lots).Ford, too, is anticipating a future replete with electric, semi-autonomous, driverless and shared cars: Two years ago, it announced a $4.5 billion investment in electric vehicles. But to pay for this speculation (electrics are 1% of U.S. car sales, despite tax incentives to buy what the government prefers), Ford is diverting $7 billion from cars to vehicles for which there actually is demand — SUVs and trucks (its F-Series pickup has been America's best-selling vehicle since 1982).The automobile industry is precariously poised between a glamorous past and a future as opaque as it was when Henry Ford supposedly said that if he had begun by asking customers what they wanted they would have answered ""a faster horse."" Or when the company he founded produced a car named for his son Edsel.""This is a long-lead-time business,"" says Barra, as she tries to peer over the horizon to develop products for a public that increasingly can work and shop without leaving home, and that decreasingly vacations as it was exhorted to by the theme song of ""The Dinah Shore Chevy Show"" (1956-63): ""See the USA in your Chevrolet."" The torrid romance that was America's car culture has cooled (the percentage of 12th graders with a driver's license has declined from 88 to 73 since 1978), the sedan (Chevrolet's Impala has been around since 1958) is an endangered species, and car companies are preparing for a future in which the crucial metric is not the number of vehicles sold to consumers but the number of miles traveled by consumers.Barra, 55, whose father was a die-maker for Pontiac for 39 years, remembers when auto dealers covered their showroom windows with paper to build excitement for the first glimpses of new models. She is banking on a more sophisticated kind of excitement for smartcars. They will be designed for customers who in 2006 did not know that soon they would not be able to imagine living without the smartphones that in 2006 they could not imagine.

117,GPS,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — The head of Air Force Space Command offered a bullish, albeit qualified, endorsement of the commercial space sector's efforts to launch reusable rockets, continuing a rapid shift away from the military's prior skepticism.XCurrent rockets for the Air Force are one and done, a practice that Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has likened to using a Boeing (BA) 747 once. But the space industry is looking for ways to make space travel affordable, and the Air Force is warming up to the idea of reusability.""That's the way industry is going. It's cost effective,"" Gen. John Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command, told reporters at the Air Force Association's annual Air Space & Cyber conference Wednesday. ""But we need to do a review to make sure they are safe. Then I'm all in for using reusable rockets to launch our satellites.""The Air Force, which needs reliable rockets to deliver sensitive spy satellites and mission-critical GPS satellites, hasn't been so open to the idea in the past.Just last year, the director of launch enterprise for Space Command's Space and Missile Systems Center said it could be a ""long time"" before the Pentagon OKs a reusable rocket to launch national security payloads.But in April, a month after SpaceX launched its first payload with a reused rocket, Raymond signaled openness to it, saying ""I don't think we can say we won't follow suit."" SpaceX had been testing boosters can land on both land or a drone ship. That culminated with the launch in March, when a Falcon 9 rocket sent a telecommunications satellite from Europe's SES into orbit. In June, SpaceX did it for a second time, sending Bulgaria's first communications satellite into space.But the entire rocket isn't reused. The SpaceX launches incorporated a reused, or ""flight proven,"" first stage, which includes a booster that holds the fuel and nine engines.SpaceX has said launches with reused first stages could be 30% lower than the current $62 million the company charges to customers. In April, Musk tweeted that he was "" fairly confident"" the upper stage, which includes the nose cone that keeps the payload safe, could be reusable, with the entire rocket able to be reused by late 2018.SpaceX's rival are also working on reusability. Blue Origin, founded by Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos, plans for his New Glenn rocket to have a reusable first stage.And United Launch Alliance, a Boeing- Lockheed Martin (LMT) joint venture, is developing reusable booster main engines that can be captured in midair as well as a reusable upper stage with improved performance for ULA's existing systems. Both are scheduled to debut in the mid-2020s, said a ULA spokeswoman.Shares of Boeing closed up 0.2% on the stock market today and remain in buying territory after breaking out from a flat base on Monday. Lockheed ended virtually flat at 308.01, below its 308.58 entry.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.In addition to the cost savings, there's another upside to launching reusable rockets. Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, commander of the 45th Space Wing, noted in an interview Tuesday that engineers can actually look at the hardware after it's flown.For instance, a Falcon rocket had a problem with its GPS systems that likely wouldn't have been discernible from the telemetry data alone, he said. Crews looked at the rocket when it came down and discovered that there wan't enough silicon around a screw.RELATED: SpaceX Once Sued The Air Force; Here's What Top Brass Thinks NowDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBoeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In Space

118,GPS,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — SpaceX, which was founded by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, has pushed the Air Force to change its ways and go faster.XThe Air Force has a long history with space launches, from the Atlas program to the space shuttle, but upstart SpaceX forced the regimented service to change the way it does business.""It might have taken us a decade to change our process. But in order to support SpaceX, we just throttled that up,"" Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, commander of the 45th Space Wing, said in an interview at the Air Force Association's annual Air Space & Cyber conference. ""So they are making us better, and that's great.""But the relationship between SpaceX and the Air Force wasn't always so great.In 2014, SpaceX sued the Air Force, saying it was allowing United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of  Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), to have a monopoly on military launches.SpaceX dropped the suit a year later and the relationship warmed.""My job is to manage risk and keep the public safe,"" Monteith said. ""So, I embrace what they bring to the table to increase our launch rate and increase our throughput. The more business they bring in, the cheaper we can provide launch services, the more often we can launch. That spurs growth in the industry, which is good for the taxpayer as well.""IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Lockheed shares closed up 0.7% at 307.90 on the stock market today, nearing a 308.58 buy point from a flat base. Boeing rose 1.2% and remains in buy range.Earlier this month, SpaceX launched the Air Force's secretive unmanned space plane, the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle.The company will fly its first Falcon Heavy, which SpaceX is touting as the most powerful operational rocket in the world, in November, Monteith said, adding that the Heavy's first government payload, a GPS system, is scheduled for takeoff next year.Monteith said 13 years ago the Air Force had one commercial space launch and seven military launches. Next year, it plans to have 35 launches, with 28 of them commercial. ""The paradigm has completely shifted. We have to adopt commercial business practices. We have to be innovative. We have to be affordable and accessible."" RELATED: Boeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In SpaceSpace Industry Booms On Wings — And Wallets — Of Billionaires Like Elon MuskSpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

120,GPS,"Ford Motor (F) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are corporate neighbors, with Ford's Dearborn, Mich., headquarters just 30 miles from Domino's home in Ann Arbor. On Tuesday, they agreed to carpool on autonomous driving services, with self-driving-capable Ford cars delivering Domino's pies.Randomly selected Domino's consumers in Ann Arbor will be able to have their deliveries via a Ford Fusion Hybrid Autonomous Research Vehicle, the companies announced Tuesday in a joint statement. The test delivery car will be manually driven by a safety engineer, although Ford has tested and refined the underlying self-driving technology and delivery experience in autonomous driving mode.""For this phase of the research, we're not testing the capability of the self-driving system,"" a Ford spokesperson clarified to IBD via e-mail. ""The focus of this research is on understanding the customer's reaction to and interaction with the vehicle for the pizza delivery process. Therefore, manually-driving is the safest way to conduct this type of observational research.""The research will be crucial to enhancing customer experience and understanding ""perspectives around the future of food delivery"" as Ford builds out its autonomous or self-driving business, the auto giant said. It plans to begin production of self-driving vehicles in 2021.Ford is often viewed as a laggard in autonomous driving and emerging automotive technologies, but is striving to gain ground.""As delivery experts, we've been watching the development of self-driving vehicles with great interest as we believe transportation is undergoing fundamental, dramatic change,"" added Patrick Doyle, Domino's president and CEO.Customers will be able to track the delivery vehicle through GPS. They will also receive text messages on how to retrieve their pizza using a unique code from inside the self-driving vehicle.""The focus of self-driving cars has largely been on the technology — the machine,"" said Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst at Autotrader. ""But, ultimately, self-driving vehicles must improve people's lives. Through the seemingly mundane business of pizza delivery, Ford and Domino's will explore the human-machine interface of self-driving vehicles, which ultimately could be the most important measure of the technology's success.""IBD'S TAKE: Domino's has been a delivery and mobile ordering leader for years, fueling earnings and stock gains. In this IBD interview, CEO Patrick Doyle discussed the future of Domino's and the broader restaurant industry.Both automotive manufacturers and retailers confront unprecedented disruption in their respective industries. Domino's Pizza has long held an edge in mobile ordering and delivery, but rivals are catching up. McDonald's (MCD) is rapidly expanding delivery and will soon release a mobile order-and-pay app.Ford shares rose 0.5% to 10.84 while Domino's stock lost 0.2% to 178.43 on the stock market today.Shares in both companies are almost 20% off their 52-week highs. Domino's has surrendered all the gains it made since breaking out of a flat base with a 192.11 buy point in May.McDonald's, which is near record highs, dipped 0.2% at 159.38.Among major automotive stocks, General Motors (GM) closed up 1 cent to 35.52. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) fell 0.7% and Tesla (TSLA) rose 0.6%.Last week, Ford announced a pact with China-based automaker Anhui Zotye to explore jointly building and selling all-electric vehicles in that country.RELATED:China EV Sales Seen Soaring 1,000%, So Ford Eyes Local PartnerFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru WindowAutomotive Industry News, Self-Driving Cars And Stocks To WatchFiat Chrysler May Be About To Take Big Step Toward Selling Itself

121,GPS,"Health-focused wearable device maker Fitbit (FIT) is betting its comeback on a true smartwatch that will compete with Apple's (AAPL) market-leading Apple Watch.San Francisco-based Fitbit on Monday introduced its Fitbit Ionic smartwatch, as well as Bluetooth wireless headphones and a new Wi-Fi-connected smart bathroom scale.Fitbit Ionic will be available in October and cost $299.95. It comes in three colors and has a range of replaceable wristbands. The Ionic smartwatch includes a sensor that can estimate blood oxygen levels, called a relative SpO2 sensor. It also has improved heart-rate tracking, GPS tracking, water proofing, on-device workout coaching, and automatic activity and sleep tracking.Other features include contactless payments, onboard music from Pandora Media (P), smart notifications, customizable watch faces and other apps.Fitbit Ionic boasts four-day-plus battery life on a single charge. Battery life is 10 hours when using GPS or playing music.In March 2016, Fitbit launched a ""smart fitness watch"" called Blaze, but it wasn't a true smartwatch because it didn't offer access to third-party apps. The company's new Fitbit App Gallery will launch with apps from Starbucks (SBUX), Strava and AccuWeather.Like the Apple Watch, Fitbit Ionic needs to be paired with a smartphone with full functionality.However, subscribers to Pandora's premium services will be able to listen to up to 300 downloaded songs phone-free. Fitbit Ionic users can listen to the music with any Bluetooth headset, including the company's new Fitbit Flyer wireless headphones. Fitbit Flyer headphones will be available in October and cost $129.95.Fitbit needs a hit product after posting losses in the last three quarters. It pivoted to smartwatches as sales of basic activity trackers and fitness bands started to decline.IBD'S TAKE: Fitbit stock has a lowly IBD Composite Rating of 3 out of a possible 99. Apple has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, meaning it has outperformed 94% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Fitbit shares climbed 3.7% to close at 5.94 on the stock market today. Fitbit hit an all-time low of 4.90 on June 22.Fitbit Ionic will compete with Apple Watch, Samsung Gear and other smartwatches.The Fitbit Ionic looks like a solid product, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said in a report.""We think its 4-day battery life and cross-platform compatibility remain key competitive advantages to the Apple Watch,"" Zino said. Plus, the Fitbit Flyer wireless headphones ""expands Fitbit into a high-growth adjacent market.""Zino reiterated his strong buy rating on Fitbit stock.Apple sells two main types of smartwatches: the Apple Watch Series 1 starting at $269 and Series 2 starting at $369. It is widely expected to release a Series 3 smartwatch this fall that will include at least one model with LTE cellular connectivity, so it won't require a smartphone for full functionality.Fitbit on Monday also introduced a new version of its Wi-Fi-connected smart bathroom scale, the Aria 2, which will be available this fall for $129.95.In the second quarter, China's Xiaomi was the world's top maker of wearable devices thanks to the popularity of its low-cost Mi Band fitness tracker, research firm Strategy Analytics said.Xiaomi captured 17.1% market share in wearable unit shipments in the June quarter. Fitbit came in second with 15.7% market share, followed by Apple with 13%, Strategy Analytics said.RELATED:Rumored Apple Watch With Built-In Cellular Called 'Pointless'

On May 14, Teradyne (TER), a top supplier of test equipment, announced an agreement to buy Denmark-based Universal Robots for $285 million, plus $65 million more if the firm meets certain targets.

284,GPS,"Russia Collusion: If there is bipartisan agreement on anything these days, it is that Donald Trump Jr. was foolish to have met with someone who represented herself as someone with ties to the Russian government in order to get some dirt on Hillary Clinton. But the hypocritical and selective outrage of the Democrats in attacking the younger Trump is mind-boggling.Let's put what young Donald did into perspective: He and Trump campaign official Paul Manafort met for 20 minutes with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who Trump thought could help his father's campaign by dishing dirt on his opponent. He got exactly nothing, except a lecture about U.S. sanctions against Russia. Nothing was exchanged, as far as anyone knows. A one-off meeting that led to nothing other than more anti-Trump Democratic hysteria.Now, for the Democrats.It's an unfortunate and well-documented truth that the Democratic Party and its allies have for years fallen all over themselves actually colluding not just with Russia, but with its predecessor, the Soviet Union, which truly was an Evil Empire and a sworn enemy of the U.S. They've neither acknowledged it nor appear to feel that it's in any way a problem. And now they act shocked — shocked! — a Republican dared to speak to a Russian.To see the hypocrisy inherent in this requires just a few recent examples. These are by no means exhaustive; there are many, many more.Hillary Clinton: President Trump's 2016 foe, Hillary Clinton, presented her Russian counterpart with a famous gag ""reset button."" It was supposed to represent a new era in U.S.-Russian ties. Instead, it was a transparent and pathetically weak attempt to appease Russia, which proceeded to annex the Crimea and parts of Ukraine during her tenure as secretary of state. But her ties to the Russians and collusion with them and other questionable nations went far deeper and was far more troubling than Donald Jr.'s ever was.Last January, Politico reported that the Democratic National Committee, acting on behalf of Hillary, actually contacted officials in the corrupt government of the Ukraine seeking opposition research against Trump. ""Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office,"" Politico said. ""They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton's allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisors.""Is that not collusion? By the way, Ukrainian-supplied information about Manafort meeting with Russian officials led to him being fired by Trump. So the DNC actually used the information.OK, but what about Russia? The media did very little due diligence on reports of Hillary's collusion with Russia. As we reported in May, not only did Bill Clinton get $500,000 in 2010 for giving a speech in Moscow, paid for by a company with ties to Russian intelligence, but he did so while Hillary was the nation's top diplomat.We noted the overwhelming stench of collusion between the Clintons and Russia, noting that Viktor Vekselberg, a ""Putin confidant,"" and other Putin cronies gave money to the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton charity also took in millions from Uranium One, which was sold to the Russian government in 2010. With its acquisition, Russia gained control of 20% of the U.S.' uranium deposits. Hillary's State Department approved the sale.John Podesta: Hillary's campaign manager didn't disclose during the campaign that he had received 75,000 shares of stock from Joule Unlimited, which was financed by the Kremlin. Podesta served as a director of the company from 2010 to 2014, when he joined the Obama White House. He hid the holdings from public scrutiny by transferring them to a shell company called Leonidio Holdings, that he incorporated a mere week and a half before taking a post in the White House.Oh, and don't forget Tony Podesta, John's brother, who was paid $24 million in fees as a lobbyist in 2016, much of it from foreign governments. He lobbied for Sberbank, a Russian financial firm, that was trying to get U.S. sanctions removed that had been imposed after Russia took the Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.President Obama: Famously, President Obama met with then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a protege of Vladimir Putin, at a 2012 conference in Seoul. In comments he thought weren't being picked up by a microphone, Obama said he needed time, ""particularly with missile defense,"" until he was in a stronger political position.Here's the ensuing conversation. You can decide whether it amounts to collusion.Medvedev: ""I understand your message about space.""Obama: ""This is my last election. … After my election I have more flexibility.""Medvedev: ""I will transmit this information to Vladimir.""And, of course, there was the fact that Obama did virtually nothing as Putin ransacked the Crimea, threatened Poland and the Baltic nations, while Obama himself outsourced the fight against ISIS to Russia, leading to the mass murder of civilians there. This too is collusion, the inevitable result of someone who cravenly promised ""flexibility"" to a dictator.DNC/Russia: The DNC used disinformation from a highly questionable source linked to the Russians to discredit Trump last year. Former British spy Christopher Steele produced a dossier containing lots of salacious charges against Trump, including some obscene in nature. Steele handed the dossier over, but only after being paid by Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was itself being paid by a Hillary Clinton supporter.As the Washington Times' Rowan Scarborough wrote this week: ""Mr. Steele makes clear that his unproven charges came almost exclusively from sources linked to the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He identified his sources as ""a senior Russian Ministry figure,' a former 'top level Russian intelligence officer active inside the Kremlin,' a 'senior Kremlin official,' and a 'senior Russian government official.' ""And the Democrats paid for this information, and then circulated it.Russia/Green Groups:  In the last election, Hillary Clinton made special cause with left-wing green groups, since she had plainly stated her intent to take down the fossil fuel industry — and along with it, American industry and its way of life — a long-cherished goal of the far-left green movement. Now, according to House Science Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, it turns out that the green groups were working in collusion with — you guessed it — Russia.As Smith told the Wall Street Journal, ""If you connect the dots, it is clear that Russia is funding U.S. environmental groups in an effort to suppress our domestic oil and gas industry, specifically hydraulic fracking. They have established an elaborate scheme that funnels money through shell companies in Bermuda. This scheme may violate federal law and certainly distorts the U.S. energy market. The American people deserve to know the truth and I am confident (Treasury) Secretary (Steve) Mnuchin will investigate the allegations.""Tens of millions of dollars funneled to green groups to attack the U.S. energy industry, on behalf of Russia and global warming.The fact is, the Democratic Party and their allies on the left are up to their necks in real, actual, demonstrable and irrefutable collusion with the Russians and their dictatorial former-KGB leader, Vladimir Putin. With a few notable exceptions, the mainstream media have all but ignored this, in favor of hyperventilating over a nothingburger meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who was, by the way, allowed into the U.S. on a special visa by none other than Attorney General Loretta Lynch.Democrats and the left didn't just collude with Russia; they embraced them, and show no shame in having done so.RELATED:Oops!

The S&P 500 rose 0.1%. Selling in the final minutes erased a small gain for the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed a fraction lower. Small caps were back to their lagging ways, with the Russell 2000 off 0.3% at the closing bell.Even though the Nasdaq led, the composite suffered from lower volume and weaker breadth. Volume fell on the Nasdaq and rose on the NYSE, the early numbers showed.  Losers led by a 7-5 ratio on the Nasdaq, while winners topped losers by 11-to-10 on the NYSE.Part of the imbalance can be attributed to the sector performance. Energy and metals led the market and helped the S&P and NYSE broaden gains. Meanwhile biotechs, a Nasdaq-rich industry group, were down 1.4%.Priceline (PCLN), a large Nasdaq component, edged past the 1927.23 buy point of a flat base. But the stock closed below the entry and volume was well below average, which added up to an uncertain breakout attempt.Delphi Automotive (DLPH) broke out past the 90.15 buy point of a flat base as shares climbed 2%. While the price action was better, volume also was weak for Delphi.58.com (WUBA) broke out past the 47.48 buy point of a cup base in heavy volume. The Chinese e-commerce stock closed below the buy point but volume was about double its average.It was another bad day for retail.

286,GPS,"As the iPhone marked the 10th anniversary of its introduction on Thursday, Apple (AAPL) is busy making the product that could replace it.XApple released the first iPhone on June 29, 2007, and has gone on to sell more than 1.2 billion units of the handset. The product revolutionized the mobile phone business and made consumer electronics categories like MP3 music players, digital cameras and portable GPS devices obsolete.Now Apple is developing a product that could eventually obsolete the iPhone: smart glasses with augmented reality capabilities, says Gene Munster, a longtime Apple analyst and managing partner of Loup Ventures.Apple is ""embracing the Innovator's Dilemma"" and is preparing for a day when Apple Glasses will cannibalize iPhone sales, Munster said in a blog post Thursday.""In 10 years, we expect the iPhone to be around, but it will be a much smaller part of Apple's business as Apple Glasses grows,"" Munster said. ""This handoff between iPhone and Apple Glasses will be choreographed by Apple as the company once again embraces the innovator's dilemma and upgrades consumers to a superior device.""Munster predicts that Apple will release the first version of its internet-connected smart glasses in spring 2020. He expects it to have an average selling price of $1,300 to start.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest on Apple stock, visit IBD's news page Apple (AAPL) Stock Quotes, Company News And Chart Analysis.In the meantime, the near-term outlook for iPhone is bright, with the highly anticipated iPhone 8 expected to be unveiled in September, Munster said. That 11th-generation iPhone is expected to feature a major redesign with a 5.8-inch OLED display, wireless charging and augmented reality applications.""We expect the next iPhone cycle to see growth of 15% and iPhone will account for 63% of Apple's revenue in 2017,"" Munster said. ""Then things slowly change; in 2019 we expect iPhone revenue to be up just 1% year over year.""Munster forecasts iPhone revenue to decline by 3% to 4% in fiscal years 2020 to 2024. In fiscal 2022, the iPhone will account for 48% of overall sales as Apple Glasses slowly gains market adoption, he said.Apple shares slid 1.5% to close at 143.68 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple Services Sales Seen Slowing, Jeopardizing Goal To Double Business
"
287,GPS,"Scandals: The past few days have seen several interesting developments on the supposed Trump/Russia scandal. But instead of causing further damage to President Trump, they're making the entire story look like a multilayered smear campaign by Trump's enemies.Over the weekend, the New York Post reported that the firm behind the infamous Trump dossier — Fusion GPS — has been stonewalling the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has been trying to get information on who paid the firm to produce it and how it was used by government officials.It has been publicly known since at least early January that Fusion GPS was behind the discredited dossier, which claimed that Russia had backmailable information on Trump, and that it was a notorious opposition research firm that was often enlisted to dig up dirt on Republicans, including a 2012 smear campaign against a donor to Mitt Romney's campaign.As the Post notes, one of the Fusion's founders, Peter Fritsch, contributed ""at least $1,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary for America campaign.""The Post story has sparked renewed interest in this dossier, most of which has been discredited, but which appears to be serving as a ""road map"" to various investigations.That was strike one against the anti-Trump conspiracy mongers.Strike two happened Sunday when an internal memo from CNN Money's executive editor Rich Barbieri leaked. The memo told reporters that ""no one should publish any content involving Russia without coming to me or (VP of Premium Content Video) Jason (Farkas) first. ... No exception.""That memo came after CNN was forced to retract a story it had posted on its website claiming that Trump advisor Anthony Scaramucci was under investigation for ties to Russia. Turns out the story — based on a single anonymous source — was false. CNN pulled the story and apologized to Scaramucci.Things got worse for CNN late Monday, when the network announced that three employees involved in the fake Scaramucci story were gone. Then Project Veritas, the guerrilla journalism outfit run by James O'Keefe, released undercover video showing a CNN producer admitting that the network's fixation on Trump and Russia had little to do with the merits of the story, and much to do with appealing to its liberal audience.CNN's wasn't the first Russia-related story pushed by the mainstream press that turned out to be exaggerated or false, but it was the most embarrassing one to date. And it showcased what many suspected — that Trump-hating reporters and editors had dropped all pretense of journalistic professionalism in order to peddle dirt on Trump.Then, on Sunday, the Obama administration started to come under attack. That got started by, of all places, the Washington Post, which offered a detailed account of how the administration knew about Russia's efforts to influence the election months before the polls opened, but did nothing about it.Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN over the weekend that ""the Obama administration should have done more when it became clear that not only was Russia intervening, but it was being directed at the highest levels of the Kremlin.""On Monday, Trump amped the story up, tweeting that Obama ""colluded or obstructed"" with the Clinton campaign by downplaying Russia because he assumed Clinton would win.Note what is missing from all these stories — any evidence that Trump had anything to do with Russia's efforts. Given that this yearlong investigation has turned up nothing, we'd argue that it's time for Robert Mueller and congressional investigators to start looking at whether the Obama administration broke any laws in its attempt to destroy the Trump presidency before it got started.Note: This editorial was updated to include developments after it posted Monday afternoon.RELATED:Is Mueller Too Conflicted To Investigate Trump Fairly?Democrats Trot Out Plan C In Their Never-Ending Trump Impeachment CrusadeDid Obama White House And Loretta Lynch Illegally Meddle In 2016 Election?

"
303,GPS,"The $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.
"
304,GPS,"Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
305,GPS,"That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.
"
306,GPS,"And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.
"
307,GPS,"In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.
"
308,GPS,"Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.
"
309,GPS,"The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.
"
310,GPS,"Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.
"
311,GPS,"IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?
"
312,GPS,"Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.
"
313,GPS,"In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.
"
314,GPS,"Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.
"
315,GPS,"So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.
"
316,GPS,"IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?
"
317,GPS,"Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.
"
318,GPS,"IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.
"
319,GPS,"Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
"
320,GPS,"IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?
"
321,GPS,"Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.
"
322,GPS,"IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?
"
323,GPS,"Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.
"
324,GPS,"Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.
"
325,GPS,"IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?
"
326,GPS,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.
"
327,GPS,"And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.
"
328,GPS,"IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?
"
329,GPS,"Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.
"
330,GPS,"IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?
"
331,GPS,"Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.

332,GPS,"Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.

333,GPS,"IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth. Is this a beneficiary of ObamaCare?
"
334,GPS,"Hollond: The Affordable Care Act means more people are covered by insurance, so more people get health care and drugs. The ACA is a driver, but not the full story.
"
335,GPS,"AmerisourceBergen is a pure play on drug distribution. If that's what you want to invest in, you can get that solely through AmerisourceBergen.
"
336,GPS,"They've got some favorable fundamentals driving long-term attractiveness. With generics, after this year there will be robust acceleration in the generics launch calendar. That will provide a lift.
"
337,GPS,"IBD: What about specialty pharmaceuticals?
"
338,GPS,"Yogasundram: That's another area for them. They have key expertise. And there's robust growth in the specialty area. And it's higher margin. So it's an increasingly larger part of their business.
"
339,GPS,"Let me mention one last thing. They acquired MWI Veterinary Supply, which presents an increasing market they can go after.
"
340,GPS,"IBD: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is a play on heightened concerns about network security, right?
"
341,GPS,"Yogasundram: You're right. What you have today is an installed base of security that is woefully behind the threats.
"
342,GPS,"Palo Alto is a next-generation security company, enabling customers to better defend themselves. Palo Alto is a secular share gainer. And it provides many more services than its layered defenses.
"
343,GPS,"Their initial sale to a customer is an appliance. The second, third and fourth sales are higher margin. Their services can tell a customer exactly what happened (when a security breach occurs) and how to prevent that breach.
"
344,GPS,"IBD: Lighting sounds dull. What's attractive about Acuity Brands (AYI)?
"
345,GPS,"Yogasundram: Acuity is the largest lighting equipment company in the U.S. Adoption of LED lights is accelerating, especially as costs go down, so customers are layering in more products with LEDs.
"
346,GPS,"When you have both cyclical and secular drivers, we really like that. That's what we have here.
"
347,GPS,"IBD: What's your outlook for Electronic Arts (EA), which plans to release its next ""Star Wars Battlefront"" game about a month before December's scheduled debut of the next ""Star Wars"" movie?
"
348,GPS,"Yogasundram: We started investing a couple of years ago when a new management team came in. They found a heavily bloated infrastructure. In the past couple of years they've reduced costs, reduced the number of (game) titles. Margins expand from 9% and 10% to 25% in the four or five quarters.
"
349,GPS,"IBD: Is your stake in Hain Celestial (HAIN) a play on the growing appeal of organic and healthful foods?
"
350,GPS,"Yogasundram: Correct. They've been in organic foods for some time. But we're really seeing two things happen. One is that organics is not just a Whole Foods (WFM) story (which the fund also owned as of its latest disclosure). It is also a Kroger (KR) story. It is a Target (TGT) story. Organic food is going from early adopters to more mainstream consumption.
"
351,GPS,"That's a trend we're playing in a few different directions, including Whitewave Foods (WWAV) and Constellation Brands (STZ).
"
352,GPS,"With Hain, they're selling more to Whole Foods and to Target and Kroger, so they're expanding distribution. And they're layering in more products. So it's a solid organic secular growth story.
"
353,GPS,"IBD: Constellation isn't an organic play, so what is your thesis?
"
354,GPS,"Yogasundram: There is a consumption change. Millennials and people in general are drinking beer less and wine and spirits more.
"
355,GPS,"Constellation was part owner of Corona, the largest U.S. beer brand, and they brought the brand in-house and a few others like Pacifico. Since then, they've boosted advertising and brand awareness, and really started to grow that business. Beer is a 1% to 2% grower, but they've been growing it 10% to 11% to 12% the past couple of years.
"
356,GPS,"They've seen better margins and better capital allocations and buybacks, but the crux is that they're a share gainer.
"
357,GPS,"Corona grows faster than the U.S. market. There's a growing U.S. population of Latin Americans, and their favorite (beer) is Corona. But the mainstream U.S. is also drinking more Corona.
"
358,GPS,"Constellation is also bringing Pacifico and Modelo as alternate brands to the U.S.
"
359,GPS,"IBD: Is Middleby (MIDD) a play on growing U.S. GDP growth?
"
360,GPS,"Yogasundram: It is a play on the U.S. economy in general. But you're also getting refreshes (in commercial kitchen equipment). For example, Chipotle (CMG) wants not only Mexican food, but also to move into pizza. McDonald's (MCD) wants to change their mix of items to more health friendly. So changing consumer tastes drives changes in equipment.
"
361,GPS,"And Middleby sees growth in emerging markets. If Yum (YUM) wants to grow in China, it needs more restaurants, more ovens.Best Mutual Funds 2015: April Performance ReportThe $5.9 billion American Century Heritage Fund has been in a groove.Its return this year through April 30 was 6.42%. That topped 91% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.That was a big step up from the fund's performance over the past 12 months. Its 16.89% gain in that period beat 79% of its peers.And it's a giant step up from its performance over the past three years.In that span, the stock mutual fund's 13.61% average annual gain outran just 35% of its peer group.Managers David Hollond and Greg Walsh have not changed their approach. It's the stock market that's changed, the managers say.The market is rotating back toward the high-quality, low-debt stocks that this fund likes and that have made it a top stock mutual fund over the past decade.Lead manager Hollond, 45, and senior investment analyst Nalin Yogasundram, 39, discussed from their offices in Kansas City, Mo., what the Heritage management team has been doing to return to the front ranks of successful investors.IBD: Why is the mutual fund's relative performance improving?Hollond: The weak economy and low-interest-rate environment were difficult for us.In that environment the past several year, there was a high correlation between stocks. Investors did not differentiate between stocks. Lower-quality, highly leveraged companies would not do well without access to cheap capital.Though the Federal Reserve has not acted yet, now it feels like (the start of interest rate hikes) is not far away, although it's not clear exactly when that will begin.So the prospect of higher rates is turning into a headwind for lower-quality, highly leveraged companies. It's a tailwind for the type of higher-quality companies we like.IBD: So the outlook for normalization of interest rates has helped the fund, right?Hollond: So long as things normalize, that should benefit this fund. It's already benefiting.IBD: For people who may not know your basic approach, take a moment to describe it, please.Hollond: We are growth managers. What we look for is early recognition of acceleration in a company's growth rate. We try to find companies at the inflection of their fundamental improvement. We try to find companies growing faster today than in the recent past, and which will continue to grow faster. The key is, we look for catalyst-driven acceleration. We look for a driver that explains why the growth rate has picked up, a driver we can analyze and be confident that is sustainable for the foreseeable future.IBD: You invest bottom up, not based on sectors. Yet sector weights reflect where you've been expecting to find buys. Why were consumer discretionary, technology and industrials your three biggest sectors as of March 31?Yogasundram: We look for bottom-up ideas. But consumer discretionary and tech have dispersion. You can find companies doing well vs. companies doing badly. It's unlike energy, where it's much harder to find dispersion.IBD: Is your stake in Harman International Industries (HAR) a play on U.S. economic expansion fueling more car purchases?Hollond: Harman does infotainment in car systems. Years ago, you found that only in high-end cars. It's been moving down market. So Harman has been improving its content per car.Yes, they're benefiting from a cyclical trend. But Harman is also a secular story, independent of the economic cycle. There's this secular trend toward infotainment and people wanting all of their (digital) devices to connect with their car's entertainment system and GPS. People are willing to spend more money on that. Harman has gained share and dollar content per car, getting paid more per car.IBD: What did you see in LinkedIn (LNKD) that made you boost the fund's stake to 326,000 shares as of Dec. 31 from 281,000 as of Oct. 31?Yogasundram: LinkedIn is the professional network that has the most and very accurate data on professionals like us. They're layering in more services (that they can sell) to take advantage of that data. They started by helping recruiters find better candidates for jobs. Now they're laying in services to help corporate marketing divisions sell to other businesses.And they're selling services to China. They're leveraging data well. And they're expanding services from human resources and recruiting to sales and marketing, and they're going international. It's a solid secular growth company.IBD: Thoughts on last Friday's price plunge on a disappointing outlook?Yogasundram: LinkedIn is a solid company with a good long-term outlook. However, a combination of an acquisition-related write-off and some sales reorganization drove a temporary headwind.IBD: Chipmaker Avago Technologies' (AVGO) growth has picked up. Earnings per share went from an 8% decline eight quarters ago to quarterly gains of 3%, 16%, 29%, 39%, 70%, 124% and 149%. Is it sustainable for now?Yogasundram: There are two reasons their EPS growth accelerated and will continue to improve. First, they have a top-notch management team that bought good companies in the past. Most recently, they bought LSI, which was a badly run, high-cost company with a bloated infrastructure. They made it more efficient. Those gains dropped straight to their bottom line, which you've been seeing in their EPS.Avago is the leading provider of communications devices to the iPhone and Samsung smartphones. As phones get more complex, Avago is a share gainer. And they've increased their dollar content on phones. That will continue with the iPhone 6 and 6+ and new Samsung phones as well.IBD: AmerisourceBergen (ABC) is another holding with accelerating EPS growth.

379,GPS,"GPS device maker Garmin International (GRMN) upped its game in the action camera market vs. category leader GoPro on Monday by debuting its next generation of HD sports cameras.Garmin announced the Virb X and Virb XE action cameras, which will be available this summer for $300 and $400, respectively. The main difference between the two models is that the XE has higher-resolution video and faster frame rates. GoPro cameras are priced at $130 to $500.Compared with Garmin's first-generation product, the new cameras are smaller, have better video quality and a new form factor, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a research note Monday. The new Virb cameras lack a preview screen, but have Bluetooth audio connectivity for wireless headsets and microphones.Unlike GoPro (GPRO) cameras, Garmin's Virb cameras have built-in sensors (GPS, accelerometer and gyroscope) and can connect to other Garmin products (such as a heart-rate monitor and sports watch) to allow for performance tracking. Data such as velocity, elevation and heart rate can be overlaid onto action videos of skiing, biking, skydiving and other activities.""If there's one thing missing on the new action cameras, it's 4K recording,"" Anderson said. ""We believe Garmin upgraded to an Ambarella (AMBA) chip for the new Virb cameras, but it's not the Ambarella A9, which is used in GoPro's high-end line-up. We would expect the exclusion of 4K recording to lead to a certain amount of criticism.""Garmin likely made a trade-off to save on battery life, Anderson said. Garmin chose to include sensors rather than allow for 4K ultra HD video, he said. Garmin and GoPro cameras have comparable battery life of about two hours.By contrast, GoPro excludes such sensors from its devices because it believes that sensor data can be captured from a smartphone paired with a GoPro.Overall, the new Garmin action cameras are ""good, but not great,"" Anderson said. ""We believe Garmin is including very little revenue from the Virb in 2015 revenue guidance, so if it gains popularity, that would be upside to the model.""Anderson rates Garmin stock as a buy with a price target of 60. Garmin stock was flat Monday, closing just under 47.Meanwhile, GoPro on Monday announced a new product that should help it expand into the broadcast market. It unveiled HeroCast, a wireless HD micro transmitter. Developed with Vislink, the HeroCast transmitter allows professional broadcasters to air live HD video from GoPro cameras attached to athletes.

381,GPS,"Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) both topped first-quarter forecasts after the close Thursday, joining Wal-Mart (WMT) in providing some relief to the beleaguered retail sector.Estimates: Earnings per share are expected to fall 9% to 29 cents, with revenue dipping 1% to $3.39 billion.Results: EPS of 36 cents on revenue of $3.44 billion. Same-store sales rose 2%, and were up 8% at Old Navy, down 4% at Gap and down 4% at Banana Republic.Outlook: First-half EPS is now seen down by mid-single digits, better than its prior forecast for a drop in the high-single digits. Full-year sales are seen ""slightly below"" a range of ""flat to up slightly"" vs. consensus views for a 0.4% uptick.""We've made substantial improvements in product quality and fit, and our increasing responsive capabilities are enabling us to better react to trends and demand,"" said CEO Art Peck in a statement.Stock: Gap rallied 3.5% late. Shares closed down 1.6% at 23.19 on the stock market today and have plunged 13% from a week ago.Estimates: A 10% bump in EPS to 80 cents, as revenue rises 6% to $3.27 billion.Results: EPS of 82 cents on revenue of $3.3 billion. Same-store sales rose 3%.Outlook: Q2 EPS of 73-76 cents, below views for 78 cents, as comp sales rise 1%-2%. Full-year EPS is now seen at $3.07-$3.17, with the midpoint below views for $3.15.""We achieved respectable growth in both sales and earnings during the first quarter despite the uncertainty and volatility in the external environment,"" said CEO Barbara Rentler in a statement. ""Operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin.""Stock: Ross rose 3.7% late. Shares finished 0.7% lower at 61.07, and rival TJX (TJX) ticked down 0.4% to 74.48.Retailers like the Gap have suffered as consumers opt to make purchases online and at discount retailers like Ross and TJX, whose Q1 sales and profit forecasts reported this week nonetheless weren't up to Street expectations.Macy's stock crashed last week on disappointing results, and Sears Holdings' (SHLD) CEO said some of its suppliers are trying to exploit the doom-hype surrounding the company to work out better deals for themselves. There are still some bright spots in retail, with Wal-Mart, L Brands (LB) and Children's Place (PLCE) rallying on strong results.For the discounters, physical space has maintained its appeal in part due to what the industry calls the in-store ""treasure hunt"" — that is, when customers walk in looking for a bargain and find a deal they didn't expect.And TJX on Tuesday said it is looking to home goods, which CEO Ernie Herrman said are less vulnerable to weather fluctuations. Home goods have been ""a driver"" for the company, he said, as they have for other retailers.Off-price chain Burlington Stores (BURL), for instance, has reduced its dependency on coats for its sales in part by sprucing up its home and beauty product lines.RELATED:Home Depot Is One Retailer That Isn't Falling Apart: Earnings StrongWal-Mart Targets Amazon, Pulls Away From Rivals Online; Stock At 2-Year HighTarget's Big Q1 Beat Offers Some Hope, But There's Still This Scary ThingMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will Work

382,GPS,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were little changed early Friday morning after the major averages staged a modest rebound Thursday following Wednesday's sharp sell-off.Once again, the FANG+ stocks led the way Wednesday. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) rose about 1.5% in Thursday stock market trading, with Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) climbing close to 2%. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) was a relative laggard, up 0.9%, but still outperformed the major averages.X Apple's ecosystem also thrived. Apple iPhone chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) (2.8%), Skyworks (SWKS) (2.6%) and Qorvo (QRVO) (4.15%) had big gains.Futures for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 were virtually flat vs. fair value. So were Nasdaq 100 futures. After Thursday's close Applied Materials (AMAT), Salesforce.com (CRM), Ross Stores (ROST), Gap (GPS) and Autodesk (ADSK) rallied on their earnings reports.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.2% and China's Shanghai composite was fractionally lower.Last week, Amazon celebrated its 20th anniversary as a public company. On Thursday, Facebook had its fifth anniversary. Facebook went public at 38 a share on May 18, 2012. Shares popped to 45 moments after trading began, but closed near the IPO price. Then it spent more than a year below 38. Finally, it broke out in powerful fashion in July 2013. From that 32.61 buy point, Facebook has soared 354% to Thursday's close of 147.94.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is a standout company and stock. But it's only ranked sixth in IBD's Internet-Content group. To see which stocks are the group's top performers and how they stack up vs. Facebook and objective criteria, check out IBD's Stock Checkup.It seems obvious in hindsight that Facebook would thrive, even when its stock was underwater for 14 months. But it wasn't. Yahoo (YHOO) fell behind to Google in search, and Google couldn't catch up in social media with its ill-fated Google+. Facebook, like many other internet firms, had to deal with a massive shift to mobile, where ads paid out less. That meant Facebook had to spend more to make less.However, Facebook executed brilliantly. As mobile became its dominant form, additional users and ads translated into massive revenue and earnings growth yet again. Its Instagram purchase — a month before its IPO — turned out to be a boon, especially in battling upstart Snapchat, the main unit of recent IPO Snap (SNAP).On its anniversary, Facebook kept busy. Facebook reached a deal Thursday to live-stream 20 Major League Baseball games. It'll stream a game every Friday for the rest of the season, starting on May 19 with the Colorado Rockies vs. the Cincinnati Reds. Facebook already has a pact with Univision to stream some MLS soccer games.Facebook and other streaming sites are making a big push to cover sports. Amazon recently forged a deal to air the NFL's 10 ""Thursday Night Football"" games next season. Amazon is replacing Twitter, which had those rights in the most recent season.Facebook rebounded from its 50-day moving average on Thursday in above-average volume, though trading cooled from Wednesday. It was solid action at a key support level. But with the current market uptrend under pressure, investors should be cautious about stepping in.RELATED:The Big Picture: 3 Technical Signs That Favor The BullsSalesforce.com Beats Profit, Revenue Views, Tweaks Full-Year OutlookApplied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% Again

384,GPS,"X McDonald's (MCD) on Wednesday said it will widen its new delivery service to restaurants in Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio — the latest industrywide effort to tap a growing population that does business via their smartphones.Customers can order food on a mobile app or through UberEats, which McDonald's has partnered with for deliveries. The expansion now means that delivery is offered at some 1,000 U.S. McDonald's restaurants, including 300 in LA.""We are bringing a new level of convenience to more of our customers as we continue to transform the McDonald's experience,"" CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement.McDonald's, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, last month said it would expand deliveries from its trial run in Florida, which began this year, to other cities in the U.S. during this quarter. Jack in the Box (JACK) has also expanded delivery to Los Angeles and Phoenix via its delivery partner DoorDash.McDonald's has also said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in 20,000 restaurants in the U.S. and other areas by the end of the year. The burger chain is also rolling out its new restaurant format, called ""Experience of the Future,"" which will have digital ordering kiosks and table service.Wendy's (WEN), which also has self-order kiosks at some restaurants, is also rolling out a mobile order and pay system. Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) Burger King wants to expand a mobile platform of its own.The digital expansion has the potential to make ordering food easier than ever, and analysts have said smartphone ordering marks the biggest change to the way people buy fast food since the drive-thru.But the technology raises questions about how restaurants will manage margins as they spend on technology and how they handle traffic-flow through their restaurants.IBD'S TAKE: Even as restaurants race to expand delivery, Restaurant Brands International has been growing by acquisitions.Starbucks (SBUX), which has its own mobile order and pay platform, had reported some knots in in-store customer traffic after launching the system.McDonald's, which is already testing fresh, cooked-to-order hamburger patties at some restaurants, reported minor slowdowns at the drive-thru that were later corrected.McDonald's edged down 0.6% to 146.41 in the stock market today after hitting a record high Tuesday.Wendy's fell 3.4% after setting a fresh decade high on Tuesday. Restaurant Brands retreated 1.1% from an all-time best. Starbucks dipped 0.4% to 59.73, holding just above a 59.64 buy point. Jack in the Box, which late Tuesday topped earnings views and said it would explore ""alternatives"" for its Qdoba Mexican Eats chain, rose 5.6%.The industry's delivery expansion also raises questions about competition for driver's. Domino's Pizza (DPZ), whose mobile-ordering technology has fit in well with its decades-old delivery service, is currently testing GPS technology. CEO Patrick Doyle, during the Domino's earnings call last month, also said his company was a better place for drivers to work."" ... for those drivers who are listening to this call,"" he said, ""my pitch is you're going to be more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else, and that is ultimately what keeps drivers happy is that they're busy.""RELATED:Jack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery CustomerJack In The Box Beats Views, Eyes 'Potential Alternatives' For Qdoba

386,GPS,"Apple (AAPL) has jumped to the lead in the wearable device market thanks to its Apple Watch smartwatch, while former leader Fitbit (FIT) has fallen to third place.Research firm Strategy Analytics said late Thursday that Apple claimed the No. 1 spot in the first quarter with a 15.9% market share. China's Xiaomi, which makes low-cost fitness bands, grabbed the No. 2 spot with a 15.5% market share. Activity-tracker maker Fitbit came in third with a 13.2% market share.Strategy Analytics estimates that Apple shipped 3.5 million smartwatches in the first quarter, up 59% year over year. Meanwhile, Xiaomi's wearables shipments fell 11% to 3.4 million units and Fitbit's device shipments tumbled 36% to 2.9 million units as it dealt with an inventory glut.In last year's first quarter, Fitbit led the global wearables market with a 24.7% share, followed by Xiaomi with 20.9% and Apple with 12.1%.Shipments into the sales channel are different from sales through to consumers.Wall Street analysts estimate that Apple sold about 2.8 million Apple Watch units in its fiscal second quarter ended April 1.Apple doesn't disclose Apple Watch sales figures. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday that Apple Watch sales in fiscal Q2 ""nearly doubled year over year.""Meanwhile, Fitbit announced Wednesday that its sold 3 million devices in the first quarter. Fitbit CEO James Park said underlying demand was stronger than the company's Q1 results showed because Fitbit is working to reduce channel-inventory levels.Fitbit is working on a smartwatch to compete with the Apple Watch. It's expected to be released later this year. Fitbit's current product lineup ranges from basic activity trackers to more advanced fitness bands that track heart rate. It also offers two fitness watches: Fitbit Surge and Fitbit Blaze.IBD'S TAKE: Apple remains firmly atop IBD's Telecom-Consumer Products Group with a Composite Rating of 89. Fitbit? Not so much. In the Consumer Products-Electronics category, Fitbit has a near rock-bottom rating of 2. See more on Apple in its Stock Checkup page.On Monday, Yahoo Finance posted images purporting to show Fitbit's first ""proper"" smartwatch along with Bluetooth wireless earbuds that will pair with the device. The Fitbit smartwatch is said to have built-in GPS, a heart-rate monitor and support for mobile payments. It also will be able to store music from Pandora (P) for wireless streaming to the Bluetooth headset, Yahoo Finance said.The Fitbit smartwatch was originally scheduled for release this spring, but was pushed back to the fall because of manufacturing hiccups, the article said. It is rumored to cost about $300. The Bluetooth earbuds are likely to cost about $150, it said.The new smartwatch is likely to leverage the assets that Fitbit acquired last year from the defunct Pebble for $23 million. Fitbit also disclosed earlier this year that it bought another smartwatch company, Vector Watch, for $15 million.Meanwhile, Apple is preparing to launch its third-generation Apple Watch, probably called Series 3, later this year, 9to5Mac reported last month. The new Apple Watch is likely to sport performance and battery-life improvements, the website said. Apple also could come out with an LTE wireless version of the Apple Watch, which would allow the device to have a data connection without needing to be paired with an iPhone.Apple shares rose 1.7% to 148.96, hitting a record high after falling slightly in the prior two sessions. Fitbit slid 3.45% to 6.15.RELATED:Apple Watch Sales Mystery: How Many Did Company Sell In Q2?Fitbit's Pulse Races After Q1 Beat, But It Still Has Much To Prove

Panera, which is being bought by JAB Holding, said it will hire 10,000 new employees, with about three-quarters of them being delivery drivers.Addressing the growing demand for drivers, Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle said during a conference call with analysts that the company's drivers will be ""more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else.""Shares of Domino's were up 2.5% to 185.55 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average on strong quarterly results, but off session highs of 188.85.Rival Papa John's (PZZA), which reports Tuesday, edged up 0.45%, and McDonald's added 3 cents.Domino's Q1 EPS jumped 42% to $1.26, beating Wall Street forecasts by 10 cents, as sales climbed 16% to $624.2 million, above views for $615.85 million. Same-store sales leapt 10.2%.The results come after Domino's stock lost 5.8% on April 7 on a report from M Science that forecast that U.S. first-quarter sales gains would come in ""well below the rough consensus estimate,"" according to CNBC.Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski, in a research note before Domino's earnings, had also expressed caution about Domino's sales. He cited what he said appeared to be ""rather robust"" discounting at Yum Brands' (YUM) Pizza Hut last month, when the NCAA basketball tournament took place. Slower sales in the U.K. and Australia were also concerns.As other fast-food restaurants fought each other on discounts and cheaper groceries discourage eating out, Domino's last year largely remained above the fray, putting up solid sales and EPS figures.Customers are already used to ordering pizza over the phone, so Domino's mobile ordering platform has worked particularly well as other restaurants try to digitize ordering and the experience inside their locations.RELATED:McDonald's Delivers Beefy Earnings; Execs Talk Deliveries, Digital StoresDomino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

Gap (GPS) is also seeing success with its Athleta line of women's sports wear.And in the latest sign of growing competition, ""American Idol"" singer Carrie Underwood recently launched her Calia line of fitness apparel. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) said this week the new offering will displace some Adidas and Reebok products from shelves. The retailer later clarified that stores will continue to sell Adidas products.Amid the proliferation of choices, Lululemon's entry-level price points are about twice as expensive as those for Nike and Under Armour, Goldman noted.""The competitive dynamic today is far more intense, coming from the improved women's offerings at NKE/UA, 'me, too' yoga brands like Athleta, and increased 'athleisure' focus from fashion brands,"" the note said.Analysts also said business in Canada, where Lululemon generates 25% of its sales, has plateaued with possible brand fatigue among consumers and the unlikelihood of further stores built in Canada.And the devaluation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar will put a negative impact of 500 basis points on earnings before interest and tax, Goldman added.Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter: @CiaranJMcEvoy.

482,GPS,"What was all that hubbub about President Trump wanting to kill your ability to deduct your 401(k) retirement account contributions? Any such proposal would slash your incentive to contribute to your 401(k) account — making it harder for you to save for retirement, maybe prompting you not to contribute as much, leading to a smaller retirement nest egg.So why did that news story explode into the headlines — then disappear? Here's why: It was a mistake by some news outlets, a misunderstanding. At least that's all it is for now.On April 26, White House officials outlined Trump's tax plan. A single-page summary said the plan would eliminate the vast majority of tax deductions, leaving intact a few exceptions such as charitable contributions.The next day, at the daily White House press briefing, a reporter asked if the deduction for contributions to 401(k) accounts would be among the many deductions axed by the president's plan. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the plan would preserve mortgage deductions and charitable gifts and ""that's it.""And that's what triggered the headlines about the demise of 401(k) deductions. Spicer clarified later that day that the plan would not eliminate the deduction for retirement plan contributions. But it took awhile for that clarification to spread.But who knows what will happen to the popular deduction once Trump presents a detailed tax proposal to Congress. ""There's always a danger that it could come into play as part of a compromise or negotiation between the White House and Congress,"" Rick Meigs, president of 401khelpcenter.com, told IBD.Katrina Hooper, global market strategist for Invesco's (IVZ) PowerShares line, told IBD that she expects the deduction to be left intact by the time a tax reform package is passed by Congress and signed into law. ""The American people need to be incentivized to save for retirement, and without the deduction we will see a reduction in contributions,"" she said. ""That would not be in the U.S.' interest.""But Hooper also said it's impossible to predict the outcome once Congress starts to ponder details of tax reform and once special-interest lobbyists fight to preserve a wide array of tax rules and deductions.""A lot of details will emerge through the negotiation and bargaining process that is bound to happen,"" Hooper said. ""The ultimate outcome will be a detailed plan that is much more of a compromise. There will have to be a lot of give-and-take among a lot of people with different viewpoints — congressmen, Republicans, Democrats.""But for now, the deduction stays.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHow To Keep Your Retirement Plan's GPS On Track In A Wild, Woolly World

483,GPS,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) saw its stock surge after the company posted better-than-expected first-quarter results.Fitbit stock ended the regular trading session up 12.2%, to 6.37, on the stock market today. The stock had been trading just above its all-time low of 5.31, reached on March 27.The San Francisco-based company late Wednesday said it lost 15 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of 10 cents a share, on sales that were down 41% to $299 million. Analysts were expecting Fitbit to lose 24 cents a share on sales of $279 million.Fitbit sold 3 million devices in the first quarter, below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 3.4 million. Device sales were down 38% year over year. But the average selling price for its devices was $96.45 in the quarter, well above the Street's target of $85.27, William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart said in a report. He rates the stock as market perform.""Underlying consumer demand has been better than our reported results in North America as we work down channel inventory levels, giving us increased confidence that we will enter the second half of 2017 with a relatively clean channel,"" Fitbit Chief Executive James Park said in a prepared statement.Fitbit reiterated its full-year sales and earnings targets, but guided analysts lower for both in the current quarter.For the second quarter, Fitbit expects to lose 14 to 17 cents a share on sales of $330 million to $350 million. Analysts were modeling Fitbit to lose 11 cents a share on sales of $350 million.Most analysts are still neutral to negative on Fitbit, saying they need to see more positive signs of a turnaround before changing their ratings.IBD'S TAKE: Fitbit stock has a nearly rock-bottom IBD Composite Rating of 3, meaning 97% of stocks have outperformed it over the past 12 months. For better stocks to consider, check out the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson believes the market for activity trackers is saturated. First-quarter results from rival Garmin (GRMN) provide evidence of that, he said.Garmin said revenue in its fitness device business fell 3% year over year in the first quarter, ""driven by lower volume in basic activity trackers partially offset by growth in our advanced wearables with GPS.""Fitness devices accounted for 22% of Garmin's sales in the first quarter. Garmin also makes navigation gear for automotive, aviation, marine and outdoor markets.""Garmin's report reinforced our view that the basic tracker market is saturated; we think Fitbit's exposure remains a significant headwind at 60% to 70% of total revenue and think units are tracking to roughly 30% year-over-year declines,"" Erickson said in a report. He rates Fitbit stock as sector weight with a fair value of 6.Fitbit is expected to launch a smartwatch later this year that will put it into direct competition with Apple's (AAPL) device known as the Apple Watch.""Fitbit needs innovation in software and hardware to drive increased and more consistent engagement among its registered users,"" Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a report. ""Fitbit will launch a smartwatch in second-half 2017 to complement its current Blaze ($199.95) and Surge ($249.95) products. We believe the smartwatch will be priced in the $250-$300 range to minimize cannibalization on Blaze and Surge. At these prices, if we are accurate, Fitbit's smartwatch would directly compete in a similar price category to the $269 Series 1 and $369 Series 2 Apple Watches.""Apple, the leader in the smartwatch market, said its Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year-over-year in the March quarter. It didn't provide unit sales numbers.Kernan rates Fitbit as market perform with a price target of 7.CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino upgraded Fitbit stock to buy from hold on Thursday. He kept his price target at 8.""We are encouraged by channel inventory reductions, which we expect to persist through Q2,"" Zino said.

Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

485,GPS,"Each year brings its own set of tests to your retirement plan, whether from stock market volatility, politics, the strength of the economy. But this year seems to carry an extra dose of uncertainty.How can you adjust your retirement portfolio to thrive at a time when the eight-year-old bull market is stubbornly refusing to admit its age, President Trump's policies are being challenged and interest rates are pointing higher?Foremost, don't panic, experts say. They recommend taking several steps to put and keep your retirement on track while absorbing any blows from unfavorable events.Step one is to sketch out a plan, if you don't already have one, says Eric Aanes, president of Titus Wealth Management, north of San Francisco.A plan should identify your assets, liabilities, incomes and expenses as well as your goals and time frame for each goal. Think of each goal in financial terms: It is a future expense. Do you want a warm-climate home? Do you plan to join a golf club? Will you travel a lot? Host the kids, grandkids and friends? The idea is to make sure you will be able to pay for everything, year by year.""Listing each income source helps you avoid overlooking any,"" said Skip Johnson, partner in Great Waters Financial, in Minnesota. ""The same for expenses. And listing each one helps you remember or look up the dollar amount.""If you find shortfalls where expenses are bigger than your income, you can start to plan for solutions. Those range from saving more to delaying retirement, working during retirement and putting your money into different types of assets — an annuity instead of cash, for example.Once you have your basic plan in place, you're ready to make any adjustments warranted by events as they unfold. Ways to meet that challenge are the focus of this special report.One key: Regardless of your age, start by focusing on factors you can control, not on macro factors you can't control, says Kimberly Foss, president of Empyrion Wealth Management, in Sacramento, Calif.""You can't control whether the Federal Reserve raises rates,"" Foss said. ""You can't control how the market responds to rate hikes, or how much the country spends on infrastructure. But you can control three crucial things about your own portfolio.""First, your costs. ""You can control what you pay an advisor to a degree,"" Foss said. ""And you can control expense ratios of funds and ETFs by choosing funds and ETFs with lower ones.""Second, you can control your asset allocation. The longer your time horizon and the less bothered you are by market volatility, the greater your allocation to stocks can be.Third, you can control your diversification, especially in the part of your portfolio that is devoted to diversification — your mutual funds and ETFs.Since we're in a period of rising interest rates, Foss has guided clients to lower weightings in stocks and bonds that historically get hurt by rising rates.She has advised clients to lower weightings in utilities, whose relatively high dividends make them proxies for bonds, to less than 5%. ""Each client has different needs, so I'm describing moves in general,"" she said.In bonds, financial advisor Aanes is steering clients clear of long-term debt. ""The longer the duration, the more it gets hurt by rising rates,"" he said. He's avoiding bonds with a duration of five years or more. ""We like durations of two to three years,"" he said.So if you're enticed by the cup and handle formation of Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), just be ready with an action plan if higher rates start weighing on any outsized positions in utility stocks and ETFs that you might have in your portfolio.And Aanes is rotating investor clients into high-quality bonds and funds, and away from high yield. ""In the event of a pullback in equities, high-quality corporates will hold up in price much better than high yield,"" he said.For bond mutual funds, the portfolio tab of each fund's Morningstar.com page shows details about the portfolio's duration, credit quality and sector weightings. Investors with access can find ratings and other details for individual bonds at Fidelity.com and other websites.For investors who want to hedge market uncertainty not just with income but with guaranteed income, consider fixed annuities, says Great Waters' Johnson.Annuities can provide a preset dollar amount of income that you cannot outlive. If you delay the start of payouts, that can reduce your taxable income and your Social Security taxes. But payout rates may not be better than comparably sized certificates of deposit (CDs), and fees are typically hefty. ""Understand the fine print,"" said Stan Haithcock, an annuity consultant, speaker and independent agent, who markets his services as Stan The Annuity Man.What about the prospect of lower tax rates for individuals and corporations, as well as a change in the long-term capital gains rate? ""Think long-term,"" Foss said. ""In 20 years, these changes will probably look very minor.""But don't ignore moves that can save you big bucks while not interfering with your basic investment strategy. ""One of my clients has almost $1 million in unrealized capital gains,"" Foss said. ""If the long-term capital gain rate comes down, he could save a lot.""Currently, taxpayers in the 39.6% ordinary income bracket — such as couples making $470,701 or more a year — pay 20% plus a 3.8% tax on certain investment income to help pay for ObamaCare. That could fall to 20% or even 16.5% under some proposals.Still, Foss' client was very overweight in U.S. large caps. ""It's more important for him to diversify into other categories, so I had him migrate out of one-third of those gains,"" Foss said, meaning that she directed the client to take profits on 33% of U.S. large caps so he could rotate into other categories. The client incurred the current high cap-gains levy for the sake of what Foss feels is a better strategic asset allocation. ""He'll benefit more in the long run,"" Foss said.Johnson also is trimming clients' weightings in U.S. stocks. ""Prices are above historical valuation averages,"" he said. ""For someone who would usually have a 60-40 stock-bond allocation, U.S. stocks should be a 35% weighting now,"" he said. ""We see some better opportunities in some emerging Asian markets and some developed European markets. Those areas have underperformed, but they have stability in earnings and in their governments, and several markets have accommodative monetary policies.""If you don't want to shop for individual stocks in those markets, consider ETFs, Johnson says. For more pointers about stock investing in retirement, read Ken Shreve's nearby report.And what about the prospect of big infrastructure and defense spending? Broadly, big caps like Boeing (BA) stand to benefit. But many industrials, materials and defense stocks have grown expensive. ""You still must do the homework to find individual leaders in those segments,"" Foss said. ""Companies in those segments will still have room to run if the economy keeps expanding and corporate earnings keep climbing. If not, I wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback.""Health care costs in retirement loom large. A couple settling for Medicare coverage, who retire this year, will spend an average of $260,000 for medical care through retirement, according to Fidelity Investments. How is that possible? Rising drug costs are one culprit. Another is that Medicare Parts A and B do not pay for such things as dental care, hearing-aid fitting exams, routine foot care and eye examinations. Medicare also does not cover nursing home care.And long-term care insurance (LTCI) will cost that couple an additional $130,000.Worse, many insurers are limiting LTCI coverage to five years, Foss says. And, still, premiums are soaring. ""If you buy long-term care insurance before your fifties, over your lifetime you may pay way too much,"" Foss said. ""And after age 65 insurers may not be willing to sell you a policy."" Your window of opportunity is roughly your early fifties until your mid-sixties.Making the most of an HSA account tied to your health care coverage during your working years can be a big help.Another timing related question is, When should you start to collect Social Security? If you start taking Social Security at age 62, rather than waiting until what the Social Security Administration calls your full retirement age (FRA), you can expect up to a 25% reduction in monthly benefits.And for each year that you delay the start of benefits between FRA and age 70, your eventual benefits increase by about 8%. Full retirement age is 67 for anyone born in 1960 or later.If your health and your family health history suggest that you'll live a long life, start your benefits as late as possible if you can afford that, Aanes says. But if delaying benefits means that you'll deplete too much of your retirement nest egg — because, say, you'd be forced to withdraw a lot more than 4% annually — then start your benefits early, he adds.In a nearby report, Russ Britt explains more about timing the start of Social Security.Finally, which type of retirement savings accounts should you save in? A traditional or a Roth? With a traditional IRA, you contribute a portion of pretax income, which grows tax-free and then is subject to income tax when withdrawals are made in retirement.With an IRA, the choice is entirely yours. Even if your income is too high to qualify for direct Roth contributions, you can kick in money to a regular IRA, get the deduction on your contribution, and then convert it to a Roth. You would owe income tax on the amount of the conversion.But if you're participating in a 401(k) plan and your income is too high — the 2017 phaseout range for couples filing jointly is $99,000 to $119,000 — then your contribution to your regular IRA is not deductible, says Ed Slott, founder of IRAhelp.com. When you do the Roth conversion, the tax-free portion will be the amount of after-tax funds in all of your IRAs as a percentage of all your IRA funds. If you have no other IRAs, then any conversion of nondeductible money is tax-free.With a 401(k) account, you can use a Roth only if your plan offers one.Basically, the younger you are and the more likely that your tax bracket stays the same or rises in retirement, the more you stand to benefit from using a Roth rather than a traditional IRA or 401(k). If you will be working for at least another seven years, you should use a Roth, Aanes says.IBD'S TAKE: Make the most of your IRA by investing in highly rated stocks poised to make big gains. Get started at the IBD University.And if you do convert a traditional IRA to a Roth, remember that you'll owe income tax on the money converted. Consider doing it in something like five yearly portions so you spread the tax impact out, Foss advises.Johnson provides a bottom line for coping with today's uncertainty and risk. ""Don't worry about the politics,"" he said. ""Just focus on your retirement plan. Decide what sort of retirement you want, and work backwards from a budget. Step by step, just make sure you've got the assets to pay for retirement lifestyle goals.""RELATED:IBD's Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards: New Crop Of WinnersWant To Be A Richer Retiree? 12 Ways An IRA Can Help

486,GPS,"Samsung's latest flagship smartphone is packed with high-end chips and other components — making it more expensive than its predecessors and competitors — but Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 is expected to be have similar specifications and also carry a rich price tag.Research firm IHS Markit on Friday released a report on Samsung's new Galaxy S8 smartphone in which researchers took the device apart in what is known as a teardown analysis. It estimates that the Galaxy S8 costs $307.50 to build, $43.34 higher than that of the Galaxy S7.The unsubsidized retail price for the Galaxy S8 with 64 gigabytes of flash memory is about $720. A step-up model, the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus, costs about $840.The higher build cost for the S8 is ""part of a trend that reflects something of an arms race in features among Apple, Samsung and other phone manufacturers, as they all try to add new and distinguishing hardware features,"" IHS analyst Andrew Rassweiler said in a statement. ""While there are new nonhardware features in the Galaxy S8, such as a virtual assistant called Bixby, from a teardown perspective the hardware in the Galaxy S8 and that of the forthcoming new iPhone is expected to be very similar.""Two major components of the Galaxy S8 are its gigabit LTE capability for much faster data transfer speeds and its borderless 5.8-inch ultra-high-definition OLED display.Apple's iPhone 8 could retail for $1,000 because of its premium feature set, some analysts speculate. Apple's current top-of-the-line handset, the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, starts at $769 for the base model with 32-gigabytes of data storage.Component suppliers in the Galaxy S8 are carry-overs from the S7, IHS analyst Wayne Lam said in an email.Qualcomm (QCOM) is supplying its Snapdragon 835 chip set for S8 models in the U.S. and China, while Samsung is using its Exynos chip set for S8 models in the rest of the world.Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) are supplying radio-frequency chips for the S8. Broadcom also is providing the GPS navigation receiver chip.Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) is making a wireless power receiver for the device. Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) is providing a power management chip and heart-rate sensor. STMicroelectronics (STM) is supplying accelerometer, gyroscope and barometric pressure sensors.Silicon Motion (SIMO) is making a tuner-demodulator chip for the device. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) is supplying an audio codec chip.

487,GPS,"The retail industry is facing an existential crisis — and not while mired in the depths of recession, but as the economy notches its eighth year of expansion.XIn March alone, Sears Holdings (SHLD), the parent of Sears and Kmart stores, said ""substantial doubt"" exists about its survival prospects after losing more than $10 billion over six years and watching sales fall for even longer. Urban Outfitters (URBN) likened the troubled industry to a housing bubble that has popped. And Bloomberg reported that women's apparel chain Bebe Stores (BEBE) plans to close all its 168 stores and go online only. (On Wednesday, it said it will close 21 stores and explore options for the rest.)As retailers take a hard look at the future in the age of Amazon.com (AMZN), investors face a big question of their own: Are retail stocks just flat-out doomed?No analyst interviewed for this story was ready to declare the physical store dead. But retail's wounds still run deep, and there are almost certainly too many stores in the U.S. Many stocks of top chains, while not as low as during the Great Recession, are rolling over into pronounced downtrends. The weak stock action creates short-selling opportunities for investors who believe the worst for retail is yet to come.A Yardeni Research report estimated that online shopping has grown to 29.1% of retail sales of items like general merchandise, apparel and accessories, and furniture — but not autos and fuel. That's up from less than 10% in the late 1990s. Over the same period, department stores' share of sales withered to 12.6% from around 30%.Still, companies that sell things within walls, floors and ceilings still have options in a $4 trillion market.""There's no way Amazon becomes a $4 trillion e-tailer in 10 years,"" said Jeff Roster, vice president of retail strategy at IHL Group. ""That's just not going to happen.""Analysts say physical stores can still be vital in a connected, buy-anywhere, retail-everywhere world, with chains experimenting with new uses for their locations and even e-commerce companies seeing the value of in-store experiences.""There's plenty they can do,"" Roster said of retailers. ""The question is: Will they do it?""Meanwhile, the weight has accumulated on retail stocks. Take Macy's (M), which earlier had been praised for its aggressive efforts to integrate online and in-store operations. The department store's shares have lost more than half their value since July 2015. Earnings and sales have fallen for eight consecutive quarters.L Brands (LB), whose Victoria's Secret brand ought to be more insulated from e-commerce, has seen its stock halved since late 2015. The SPDR Retail ETF (XRT) has fallen some 20% over the past two years.IBD'S TAKE: Retail stocks trending below their declining 200-day moving averages offer shorting opportunities. For example, Macy's is struggling to get back in the 30s, but that would set up yet another test of the 50-day average and a possible short entry. Dillard's has stumbled this year, down as much as 25%, and just got turned away from its 50-day. See if it can hold support at 46.56.As those trends have solidified, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett, who prides himself on being a long-term investor, divested almost all his stake in Wal-Mart (WMT) in Q4. He told CNBC in February that ""the online thing is very hard to figure out, you know?""Amazon, Buffett said, was a company ""that's gonna have everybody in their sights. And they've got delighted customers.""""Now, Wal-Mart's pushing forward online themselves and they've got all kinds of strengths,"" he later added. ""But I just decided that I'd look for a little easier game.""For much of the past 60 years, retail was an easier game. The postwar population explosion held consumerism aloft for years, says Doug Stephens, founder and CEO of retail advisory service Retail Prophet. When baby boomers' spending slowed as they reached their 50s, growth in personal credit — spurred by financial deregulation — helped pick up the slack, or at least masked weaker trends, he says.""It allowed a lot of retailers to get away with being pretty average,"" Stephens said. ""The average American aspired to be average. They aspired to the middle-class average lifestyle, and retailers like JCPenney (JCP) and Sears and others were happy to accommodate them by selling average goods and average prices with average experiences.""Then the financial crisis and recession hit. The resulting consumer flight to either luxury or deep discounting hollowed out retail's middle-of-the-road set, he added.That has left the retail industry with too many stores, not enough shoppers, and more bankruptcies. Sports Authority was liquidated last year. Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday and disclosed plans to close 400 stores. Markets are wondering if Sears and JCPenney are next.U.S. retail square footage per capita is more than six times that in Europe or Japan, Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne said in March. Deutsche Bank in February estimated that among the retailers it follows, more than 13,100 stores will have closed during the decade ending this year. The analysis indicated that 6,400-plus locations could still be pruned from those companies' store counts.With more companies clearing out of their store space, malls can try to re-anchor their properties with grocery stores and fill in other spots with restaurants and fitness centers. The anchor stores tend to draw foot traffic, but their long stretches of square footage make those spaces hard to fill, Deutsche Bank analysts say.""Fewer retail stores should translate into a direct decline in the number of viable retail properties, including malls,"" Deutsche Bank analysts Ed Reardon and Simon Mui wrote in February. ""An enclosed mall can quickly reach a 'tipping point' where a decline in foot traffic leads to further closures and rent declines (aka the mall death spiral).""And yet the store persists, with even e-commerce companies recognizing its value. In fact, the physical store is still an efficient way to grab customers, especially as the cost of acquiring them online has gone up, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said.Nordstrom's (JWN) Trunk Club, an e-commerce site that delivers clothing according to the wearer's tastes, has opened physical stores in recent years. Amazon has opened pop-up stores and plans to launch grocery stores.The pop-up, often backed by heavy online promotion, can also lend brick-and-mortar retailers flexibility and intrigue.""When you start to see a pop-up store by Amazon, that to me validates (the idea) that there is still a place for a brick-and-mortar, touch-and-feel type of retail experience,"" said Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce.Newcomers to the business, particularly in clothing, also found different ways to retail, like using real-time data and greasing their supply chains to respond more quickly to fashion trends, said Peter Dixon, who runs a number of consumer discretionary-focused funds at Fidelity, noting that it was shortsighted for some retailers to blame their problems solely on the rise of e-commerce.""Hiring star merchants to forecast fashion trends 12 months ahead of time and then commit to inventory orders nine months in advance of a season?"" he said. ""It just doesn't seem to work on a consistent basis anymore.""IBD'S TAKE: Other potential shorts include Ralph Lauren, whose stock is bumping up against its 50-day moving average. A decisive move below 75 would dump it at the lowest levels in nearly seven years. And L Brands last touched its 10-week moving average in December. Wait for an attempted rebound to that line before betting on another plunge.What may work, after retailers shrink their real-estate footprint, is a hybrid approach to stores that accommodates online orders and has more attractive floor space.Analysts say vacant stores could be used as warehouses and pickup spots for online orders. Or, in existing stores, a smaller floor space might be used to display merchandise, while a larger back area would serve the e-commerce end.Macy's and Target (TGT) are already considering such a store layout. Target has said 55% of online orders are completed at its stores, potentially strengthening the case for the strategy.Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has tried to stay digitally relevant through acquisitions. The company last year shelled out $3 billion for online discounter Jet.com. In March, Wal-Mart acquired ModCloth, which sells indie-and-retro-leaning women's apparel. Wal-Mart in February also bought online outdoor-gear retailer Moosejaw.Long-term, the ratio of apparel retailers' physical-store and online purchases could reach 50/50, Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar says. Along with a bigger focus on e-commerce, analysts stress the importance of shrinking store-counts and using the remaining stores as areas that are more ""experiential.""Several chains are trying different things along those lines, though their ability to replicate such formats on a large scale is questionable:""Specialty stores often know their customers on a personal level more closely than big-box stores do, but retailers like Target, Sears, and Wal-Mart also break up their stores into departments,"" Caporaso said over email. ""They can therefore create experiential services in those areas that target specific subsections of their customer bases.""Stephens, of the Retail Prophet, said stores could apply the pop-up approach to the way they handle in-store experiences, replenishing them several times a year to give consumers a reason to return.Such experiential offerings also speak to one of Amazon's weaknesses, especially as it picks up more merchants.""If you want a white T-shirt, and you search for a white T-shirt, you're going to get thousands of results at all different price points, and no one wants to weed through that,"" Weishaar said.She and others say that retailers that can both build out their online infrastructure and maintain a unique identity are the most likely to weather the current storm of falling sales and fleeing investors.""They'll be fine as long as they have a coolness to them,"" said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management. ""Amazon will never be cool. It's just efficient and easy.""

Same-store sales are seen as rising 6%-7%.""Backed by improving trends and strong holiday results, we are entering 2015 in very good shape. Our guests are responding positively to both the women's and men's product assortment,"" said CEO Laurent Potdevin in a release.Shares jumped nearly 8% to 63.24 on the stock market today, the highest since December 2013. Shares are up nearly 70% from a closing low of 37.25 on June 12.Lulu once was considered the most fashionable yoga-gear maker, but rivals like Gap's (GPS) Athleta and expanding women's lines from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) have bitten into sales.The company also suffered from PR disasters in the past few years, including a type of yoga pant that was too sheer and founder Chip Wilson's comment that some women don't have the correct body shape to wear Lulu's clothing.But Lululemon has been in turnaround mode. Earlier this month, analysts were bullish on the appointment of Stuart Haselden, J. Crew's finance chief, as Lulu's new CFO.Sterne Agee analyst Sam Poser upgraded Lulu to neutral from underperform on its updated guidance.""Sales acceleration during the holiday leads us to reevaluate our negative sentiment of the brand,"" he wrote in a client note.But he still sees an expensive valuation for the stock.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

511,GPS,"If you're like many people, your smartphone is at your side day and night. You use it to wake you up in the morning; to call, email, text, or Instagram people all day long; to guide you to an unfamiliar location; to lull you to sleep at night with nature sounds.Is that a problem? Are you becoming too dependent on, or even addicted to, your smartphone?Quite possibly, several studies say, though theories abound on how best to cure the problem.""Cellphones are so multifunctional, and every week we're coming up with more and more uses,"" said James Roberts, professor of marketing at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. ""Of course, they're highly portable; they're always with us, in our pockets. All that positions cellphones to be highly addictive.""Roberts and colleagues recently published a study on the topic in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions. According to their study, college students spend more than eight hours a day on average using their cellphones. Roberts said this habit has dramatically changed the behavior of students and how they communicate and relate to each other.""Ten years ago, I would walk into a classroom and kids would be bubbling — just talking and laughing. Now, I walk in and it's like a morgue,"" he said. ""Everyone is their own separate entity, doing their own thing on the cellphones. They're together, but alone.""Keep That Phone In SightAbout 60% of participants in the Baylor study concede they might be addicted to their phones. Many students indicated they get agitated if their phone is not in sight.The Baylor findings were mirrored by a recent University of Missouri study. While monitoring the blood pressure of study participants, researchers asked them to complete puzzles, first with their smartphones nearby and then with the phones farther away.The result: Participants' heart rates and blood pressure levels went up significantly when they were separated from their phones. In addition, they performed more poorly on puzzles.""Our findings suggest that iPhone separation can negatively impact performance on mental tasks,"" Russell Clayton, a doctoral candidate at the University of Missouri and lead author of the study, said in a press release. Of 136 survey respondents, 117 were users of Apple (AAPL) iPhones.The Missouri researchers, in fact, recommend that users avoid parting with their phones during daily situations that involve a great deal of attention, such as taking tests or completing work assignments.Jonathan Alpert, a New York City psychotherapist and author of ""Be Fearless: Change Your Life in 28 Days,"" focuses on a different approach. He says people need to recognize they're too dependent on their smartphones and try to change that.""If using an iPhone interferes with relationships, finances, health, or careers, it could be an addiction, or at least a pretty serious problem,"" he said.He cited frequent arguments with spouses over phone use, heavy online shopping, carpal tunnel problems and avoiding work in favor of playing video games.Both Alpert and Roberts say dependence on smartphones has made many people oblivious or even in denial of the dangers of using them in some situations, such as in cars or even walking on busy streets.Alpert says he watched a 20-something man, eyes glued to his smartphone, walk directly into a crosswalk in spite of its red light for pedestrians. Cars had to slam on their breaks to avoid hitting him.""I was just astonished when I saw it. He literally walked right into an intersection,"" Alpert recalled. ""What was most shocking, though, was that he never even looked up. He just kept walking, unfazed.""Not Just Issue For The YoungIf you're thinking this is just an issue for younger people, think again.""It's more intensified in the younger generations, but we're seeing the same kind of addictive qualities in a lot of different age groups,"" Roberts said.Alpert also pointed to a more subtle, but equally problematic, effect of overdependence on smartphones.""We're becoming dumber,"" he said. ""We've become so reliant on technology, people don't remember phone numbers anymore. They don't know how to read a map, and can't get from point A to point B without GPS.""If their phone doesn't give them an alarm just before an appointment, they'll miss the appointment. It makes life more convenient, but it dumbs us down.""Roberts agrees.""It's a kind of learned helplessness, which is the double-edged sword of technology,"" he said.Roberts' study noted some structural similarities between smartphones and ""one-armed bandit"" casino slot machines that have triggered many a gambling addiction. These may include stylized ring tones, beeps and whistles signaling incoming messages, vibrant graphics, and even certain controls such as buttons and wheels.""Such characteristics may well act as both inducers and reinforcers of cellphone use, ultimately inciting addiction,"" the Baylor study noted.Don't Go Cold TurkeyRoberts says one of the biggest problems with cellphone dependence or addiction is that people miss out on more important parts of life.""We have traded meaningful pursuits, like getting together with friends, or travel, or doing something good for other people, for going over the top on (mobile game) 'Candy Crush' or reading Instagrams or watching (short-video) Vines or any of the many other things we can do on the cellphone,"" he said. ""It's kind of a trivializing of who we are.""But even if you are a bit too attached to that slab of metal in your pocket or purse, that doesn't mean you need to stop using it cold turkey, Roberts says.""We can just cut back. Have some times during the day when we're free from cellphones,"" he said. ""Set boundaries, like digital-free family dinners, or no phones after a certain time of day. Don't sleep with your phone. Don't take it into the car; put it in the trunk.""Start out with the one behavior that will provide the biggest benefit. That's the best thing you can do because it wrests the power away from the cellphone and into your hands.""

549,GPS,"Botched testing by a Lockheed Martin (LMT) subcontractor on a key component for the U.S.' newest Global Positioning System satellites raises new questions about the No. 1 defense contractor's supervision of the project, according to a top Air Force official.The mistake by subcontractor Harris Corp. (HRS) forced another delay in the delivery of the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites until later this month, according to Major General Roger Teague, the Air Force's chief of space programs. That will make the $528 million satellite 34 months late, according to service data.Lockheed has a contract to build the first 10 of the satellites designed to provide a more accurate version of the Global Positioning System used for everything from the military's targeting of terrorists to turn-by-turn directions for civilians' smartphones.The program's latest setback may affect a pending Air Force decision on whether to open the final 22 satellites to competition from Lockheed rivals Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).""This was an avoidable situation and raised significant concerns with Lockheed Martin subcontractor management/oversight and Harris program management,"" Teague said in a Dec. 21 message to congressional staff obtained by Bloomberg News. Shares of Lockheed were up fractionally to 257.28 in late-afternoon trading.The parts in question are ceramic capacitors that have bedeviled the satellite project. They take higher-voltage power from the satellite's power system and reduce it to a voltage required for a particular subsystem.Last year, the Air Force and contractors discovered that Harris hadn't conducted tests on the components, including how long they would operate without failing, that should have been completed in 2010.Now, the Air Force says it found that Harris spent June to October of last year doing follow-up testing on the wrong parts instead of samples of the suspect capacitors installed on the first three satellites. Harris ""immediately notified Lockheed and the government"" after a post-test inspection, Teague said in his message.Lockheed spokesman Chip Eschenfelder said in an email said that testing of the capacitors' design was successfully completed in December.""The capacitors met all mission qualification requirements,"" he said, so ""we are confident the capacitors are mission-ready.""Harris spokeswoman Ellen Mitchell said in an email that company personnel last year identified a capacitor ""that was not subjected to all required qualification tests. Once the issue was discovered, Harris deployed a team dedicated to complete the required capacitor tests. The capacitor qualification testing was successfully completed in December 2016.""Teague said in an interview, though, that Harris was required to perform not only a test to show that the part met design specifications but a separate one to assess the component's reliability and whether it met a requirement to last 15 years. That second test wasn't accomplished because ""they used the wrong test item,"" he said.Cristina Chaplain, a military space systems director at the Government Accountability Office, said in an email that the latest problem ""undermines the faith in the progress, if any, that the government and contractor may have been making in turning around a culture that has led to multiyear delays"" and cost increases.The Air Force has decided to accept the first satellite even if its capacitors may be flawed because removing them could delay the delivery until October and cost about $70 million, Teague wrote to the congressional staff. The Air Force is confident in the first satellite's overall reliability based on 3,000 hours of cumulative testing, Teague said.The Air Force will have to pay to replace the suspect capacitors on the second and third satellites. That's because the satellites are being developed under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, which require the Pentagon to pay for cost increases, the service said.In an Air Force list of priorities that lacked funding for this year, the service said it needed $100 million for GPS III ""capacitor repair/replace."" Captain AnnMarie Annicelli, an Air Force spokeswoman, said the list represented potential expenditures on which final decisions had not been made.

550,GPS,"President Trump on Wednesday met with retail CEOs, promising to cut industry regulations and urging them to build more stores, while Target (TGT) afterward warned a proposed border tax would raise prices.Trump also promised a ""massive"" tax plan ""in the not-too-distant future."" That followed Trump's remarks to airline CEOs last week when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.Wednesday's meeting included CEOs from Gap (GPS), AutoZone (AZO), Target, Tractor Supply (TSCO) and JCPenney (JCP), who were in Washington, D.C., to lobby the White House and Congress against the border tax.""We're cutting regulations big league,"" Trump said at the meeting, later adding, ""You have a very, very big regulatory problem, and we're going to take care of that, because I want more jobs.""He also pressed the executives on growth.""We want you to expand your stores,"" Trump said. ""You'll tell me why you will or why you won't. And tell me why you won't, we'll work on you a little bit.""The issue of a border tax did not come up specifically during the public remarks. But Target said later it was brought up, though didn't mention what Trump said about it.""They also discussed the … proposal for a border adjustability tax, which is a priority issue for Target because it will raise prices for American families on everyday essentials,"" Target said in a statement, according to CNBC.If enacted, Target said, such a policy ""would have profound implications for our guests and business, and at Target, we believe that anything that raises prices for families is not a good idea for America.""Trump did reiterate his administration's attempts to bring down the overall tax burden on businesses and simplify the tax code, so much so, that ""H&R Block probably won't be too happy — that's one business that might not be happy with what we're doing.""Shares of H&R Block (HRB) fell as much as 2% on the comment but pared losses and were down 0.8% to close at 20.80 on the stock market today. TurboTax provider Intuit (INTU) was flat.Shares of Target were up 0.2% to 65.75, Gap added 0.8% to 24.39.

551,GPS,"CEOs of Best Buy (BBY), Target (TGT), Gap (GPS), Autozone (AZO) and others will reportedly meet Wednesday with members of Congress to argue against a potential tax on the imports they rely on to keep costs down.The executives will meet with Kevin Brady, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman and senators, according to Reuters, which added it was unclear if the executives would also meet with President Trump.Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan have been at work on a plan that would slash corporate income taxes to 20%, impose a new 20% tax on imports, but spare export revenue from being taxed, Reuters said.Shares of Best Buy closed 3% higher at 45.29 on the stock market today. Target rose 1.3% to 65.65, and Gap climbed 2.4% to 24.20.IBD'S TAKE: Along with a border tax, the retail landscape has dried up as more customers shop online and a younger generation values more meaningful experiences over things. Here's what malls are doing to stay alive. The meeting comes ahead of a potential announcement Trump said he would make in the next to or three weeks that would be ""phenomenal in terms of tax.""Higher import taxes against nations like Mexico and China could hurt a variety of retailers and force them to pass more costs onto consumers.""Border adjustments create uncertainty for multi-national brands from a tax and FX perspective while consumers face significant cost inflation,"" Cowen & Co. said in a research note last month.Nike (NKE) was among the most insulated from a border adjustment tax ""due to significant international segment mix,"" Cowen said. Hanesbrands (HBI) and G-III Apparel (GIII) were among the most vulnerable.""In a 20% border adjustment scenario,"" the firm added, ""multi-national apparel and footwear brands must immediately raise prices, on average, by a high-teens rate and hope for fairly inelastic demand but could still see profitability lowered by 70% to 20%, depending on mix of business, deductions, and FX movements even with corp. tax rates lowered to 20%.""RELATED:Retailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingPresident Trump Attacks Nordstrom To Defend Daughter's BusinessSears Dumps Some Trump-Branded Goods But Aims To 'Leave The Politics To Others'

Apple was a key contributor to all the major indexes. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly.

But that's after Wal-Mart hit eight-month low on Friday. Target (TGT) edged up 0.7%, Macy's 1.4%, Dollar Tree (DLTR) 1.6% and Gap 1.3%.Retailers tumbled at the end of last week after the White House hinted that it might back the House GOP tax reform plan that includes a 20% border-adjustment tax. House Republicans have said they see the border-adjusted tax, which applies to imports but not exports, as a critical part of tax reform because it would raise more than $1 trillion to help pay for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20%. Retailers, which are huge importers, fear the plan will slam their profits.President Trump's immigration order could end up hurting the odds of tax reform and other key parts of Trump's fiscal agenda.

556,GPS,"For the first time since Wall Street began to focus on the GOP's border-tax plan, retailers joined the rest of the stock market in a broad rally on Thursday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite to record highs.After a strong day for retail on Wednesday, Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) shares rose another 1.9% to 69.08 on Thursday, the highest close in more than a month. Dollar Tree (DLTR) surged 3.6%, Gap (GPS) added 2.8%, and Costco (COST) rose 2.6% to an all-time closing high. Dollar General (DG) raced ahead 3.5% to its highest close since Nov. 30 as its former CEO, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., made waves with his forceful opposition to the border-tax plan. (Wal-Mart retreated 1.5% on Friday as retailers were mixed overall).Meanwhile, fell Dow component Nike (NKE) shares sprinted 2.7% Thursday, retaking its 200-day moving average for the first time since August. Nike added 1.7% on the stock market today to a fresh four-month high. As ex-CEO at Nike rival Reebok, Perdue also must be looking at the border-tax debate from the view of the footwear industry that does most of its manufacturing overseas.Yet even as hopes dimmed for the GOP House plan that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20%, funded by a 20% tax on imports, the broad market charged higher on the back of President Trump's comments to airline executives that he'll be announcing a ""phenomenal"" tax plan in the next two or three weeks.Goldman Sachs (GS) helped the Dow claim new heights, rising 1.6% Thursday and 0.5% Friday. Tesla (TSLA) cruised ahead 2.7% Thursday, as it breaks out of a long base, holding its gains Friday.Steel stocks were especially strong Thursday, with U.S. Steel (X) up 8.3%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 5.7% and Nucor (NUE) 4.6%. All three stocks rose fractionally Friday.Yet assuming Perdue stands firm, the GOP can only afford to lose one more senator to keep the border tax alive. And Perdue didn't appear to leave much wiggle room to reverse his opinion: ""The clear effect of the proposed border adjust tax is an increase in consumer prices,"" he wrote in a letter to colleagues. ""This would hammer consumer confidence and lower overall demand, thus putting downward pressure on jobs.""IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.The retail stock revival and record high for the major averages raise this question: If the border tax isn't going anywhere, what does Trump have up his sleeve? If the border tax dies, Wall Street analysts have largely concluded that corporate tax cuts would have to be scaled back in a big way to make it through reconciliation, a legislative maneuver that means the GOP can pass tax cuts with only a majority vote if the package is revenue neutral in year 11 and beyond.Without a border tax, some think the effort to cut corporate taxes could collapse. At best, the corporate tax rate might be cut to 25%, but even that might be out of reach.Yet a closer look suggests that investors didn't really get carried away with Trump's mystery tax plan. Even though advancing stocks led declines by roughly 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange, Raymond James strategist Jeffrey Saut noted that the percentage of volume going into advance stocks ""was among the lowest in history"" on days when the S&P 500 has hit a 52-week high and closed positive on the day.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseWhy Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOP

558,GPS,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein said that each member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was given five minutes with President Trump last week to talk about their respective military branches and what they do.When his turn came, Goldfein said at a Mitchell Institute breakfast Friday that he stressed the importance of the Air Force's role in the nuclear triad — weapons delivered by land-based missiles, strategic bombers and submarines — space operations and manpower.He didn't specifically mention Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, of which the Air Force is the biggest buyer.""We have two of the three legs of the nuclear triad and on our worst day as a nation our job as the United States Air Force is to make sure you are where you need to be and make sure you remain connected to nuclear command and control,"" he recounted telling Trump, just before James Mattis was sworn in as defense secretary at a Pentagon ceremony last week.Goldfein also pointed out that the Air Force is responsible for GPS and communications satellites as well as other space-based assets. He stressed the need to continue maintaining air and space superiority, including ""the freedom from attack and the freedom to move"" in both domains.Lastly, Goldfein told Trump about personnel shortages, saying the Air Force was ""too big for the resources we've been given and too small for what the nation demands"" as the service's role expands.Trump's talk with the service chiefs comes as his administration plans to boost spending on weapons and troops, with several big-ticket programs on the way, including Air Force nuclear programs.Last year, the service released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's (BA) aging Minuteman system and is also seeking Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. Lockheed, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing are expected to bid, and initial contracts could be awarded this year.Northrop is also developing the B-21 Raider long-range strategic bomber to replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. Analysts have put the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.Boeing shares edged up 0.1% to 162.40 on the stock market today. Northrop shares climbed 0.7%, Raytheon 0.9% and Lockheed 1%.To develop new rockets, the Pentagon has been working with Boeing, Elon Musk's Space X and others in the private sector.Space X's Falcon 9 was decertified in September after a rocket exploded on the launchpad, but Goldfein said it is ""right on track"" be recertified for national security launches.The Air Force has been tasked to transition to at least two independent domestic commercial launch providers to help drive competition, lower costs and end its reliance on Russian-made rocket engines.

560,GPS,"After a solid month of bad news, Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and other retail stocks were among the biggest winners on Tuesday as doubts emerged over President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slash corporate taxes.Apple (AAPL) also may be seeing a benefit from a disagreement between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan over how to make a big corporate tax cut fiscally viable.Even as doubts about tax reform helped drag down broad stock market indexes on Tuesday, retailers bucked the trend. Wal-Mart rose 1.9% to 68.42 on the stock market today. Best Buy climbed 2.4% to 44.88 and Dollar Tree jumped 3.1% to 79.51. Gap (GPS) rose 2.1% to 24.15.Meanwhile, Apple edged up 0.8% to 120, extending its breakout past a 118.12 buy point to a 14-month high.A plan backed by Ryan and other House GOP leaders would raise more than $1 trillion by imposing a 20% tax on imports, while making exports tax-free and lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 20%.Trump, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Monday, took issue with Ryan's approach. Trump criticized the border-adjusted tax as ""too complicated"" and said it could result in ""a bad deal.""While prospects for corporate tax reform have been one of the key drivers of the Trump stock market rally, financial markets and Wall Street analysts see Ryan's border-adjusted tax as bad news for big importers, with retailers especially hard hit. RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Ciccarelli found that a 20% import tax could wipe out profits at Best Buy and raise Wal-Mart's tax bill by close to $10 billion.While Apple stands to be the biggest beneficiary of a reduced tax rate on profits held overseas, UBS analyst Steve Milunovich has estimated that the company could actually see an earnings drop under the full House GOP approach. Not only would the company face a tax on the value of iPhones it imports to sell in the U.S., but the value of foreign earnings could shrink in dollar terms.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Trump's chief problem with Ryan's plan appears to be the consensus that a 20% tax on all imports would lead to a significant appreciation of the dollar vs. other currencies. In weekend comments, he specifically called out China and its weakening currency.""Our companies can't compete with them now because our currency is too strong. And it's killing us,"" Trump said.Trump's comments sent the U.S. dollar index skidding 1.2%, while gold rose 1.6%. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.33%, the lowest since late November, and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since late September.Trump has vowed to level the playing field for U.S.-based producers by imposing tariffs, threatening a 35% border tax on automakers producing in Mexico for the U.S. market.But he's skeptical of Ryan's approach because economists expect the 20% tax on imports to lead the U.S. dollar to appreciate vs. foreign currencies, neutralizing any competitive advantage from imposing an import tax.Trump's disagreement with Ryan raises a number of questions. If he doesn't back the border-adjusted tax plan, how will the GOP offset the cost of tax reform? Offsets are needed because legislation passed on a partisan basis in the Senate via reconciliation must be budget neutral after the 10th year.Further, does Trump's dismissal of Ryan's plan mean that he's more likely to make good on his threat to hit imports from Mexico and China with 35% to 45% tariffs? Such a fallback could pose even greater risks to retailers and Apple than the border adjustment tax.RELATED:Trump Trade, Tax Talk Hits Dollar As Mexico Warns On TariffsBank Stock Losses Intensify After Trump Rips GOP Tax Plan

594,GPS,"With their one child finished with college and hard at work on a job, Rich and Linda Wright of Kingsport, Tenn., are hurtling toward their next big goal, retirement. He's a market research analyst, trying to rebound from a layoff. Linda is a middle-school guidance counselor, whose school days are slated to end next June.Just shy of his 64th birthday, Rich increasingly wonders how they will squeeze income from their portfolios, without risking a lot of volatility, for decades to come. He's wary of bonds' likely price erosion amid rising interest rates. One thing he is bullish about is the prospect that his online brokerage, Charles Schwab (SCHW), will help him solve this puzzle. ""My parents lived into their nineties, so that's my general life expectancy,"" Wright said. ""I know Schwab has some tools I can use.""Whether it's for retirement — like the Wrights — or other goals, investment and retirement planning tools are increasingly on the minds of Americans. Those tools were rated by investors as one of the 13 most important traits that an online brokerage can have in the 2017 edition of IBD's annual ranking of the Best Online Brokers.And they were two of the most important traits for clients of Fidelity, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade — the three top-ranked brokerages in the category.Investor's Business Daily and its polling partner, TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence, survey thousands of investors each year to find out which online broker characteristics are most important to them and how well their own broker performs in each important performance area. The investors' ratings determine the Best Online Brokers in Overall Customer Experience and in each performance category. (See the full broker survey details.)Investment and retirement planning tools qualified as a critical category for the first time this year.Fidelity, Schwab and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) were the top three brokers in the category. The tools include online interactive retirement calculators, which can tell you things like whether you're on track to save enough to generate the income you'll need. You can also find a wide variety of tools to help you make long-term strategic decisions — figuring out how to get your finances from where they are today to where you want them to be for retirement or other key goals. Those differ from tactical one-time-only decisions about, say, which securities to buy or sell today.Strategic decisions include figuring out whether to roll over your 401(k) account balance into an IRA. TD Ameritrade has an interactive tool for that.Other brokers offer tools that can knit together several related strategic decisions.Fidelity's Planning & Guidance Center (P&GC) combines several tools into one package. One, called Retirement Preparedness Measurement, gives you a score that indicates whether you are on track to save enough. If you are falling short, the tool package suggests ways to bridge the gap. For example, it will point out if you are not kicking in enough to your 401(k) account to get the maximum company match. Or it might suggest changing your asset mix to boost your weighting in growth-oriented stocks and stock funds.The package can even point out a timetable for maximizing your Social Security benefits, whether you are already receiving a check or have not filed a claim yet.Now offered to Fidelity customers, in the next few months the online brokerage plans to debut a version with fewer bells and whistles for non-customers.For Fidelity customers, the tool draws on data about assets in the Boston-based firm's care. You can enter information about assets that are in some other firm's custody, or you can give Fidelity permission to look inside those other accounts, without being able to touch the assets.Another Fidelity tool, Guided Portfolio Summary (GPS), analyzes your portfolio and tells you how you're allocated among sectors, geographies and asset types, and how your weightings compare to various benchmarks. And GPS and P&GC can ""talk"" with each other, sharing information. ""If a customer sets a retirement goal in Planning & Guidance Center, they can run a GPS analysis for that goal,"" said Jason Jagatic, vice president for product development, in the business group that oversees Fidelity's retail and defined contribution customers.Senior Vice President Matt Borden, to whom Jagatic reports, said, ""Our aim is to help people understand where they stand and then plan to look ahead, create an investment plan that works for their situation and implement it for their situation so they can achieve their goals and get a better outcome than they probably would without these tools.""Schwab offers a tool it calls Bubble Chart. It shows market performance of securities in your retirement or other account with images more than with words and numbers. The securities in your account are displayed on a grid. Each security is represented by a bubble.The size of each bubble signals its dollar value. The color of a bubble — green or red — tells you whether it has gained or lost value in the time period displayed. Each bubble's height shows its percentage change in value. The taller a bubble is, the more its value has changed.And each bubble's location on the grid signals its impact on your account. The further to the left it is, the less its impact is. The further to the right, the more its impact is. You can click or tap on each bubble to see additional data about the position.""We're in a visual world,"" said Eliel Johnson, Schwab vice president of user experience and design. ""It's a great way of conveying a lot of information in a small space. In other tools, it also helps you interact with the data — make changes to your account, change your contributions, and so on.""Said Fidelity's Borden, ""We want to think about tools that bring together your different financial planning tasks. We want to give you a holistic view of your situation and of ways of reaching your goals.""RELATED:Are You Saving Enough To Retire?

(CRI) and DavidsTea (DTEA), according to the New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was one of nine AGs investigating.Retailers have increasingly relied on last-minute scheduling to make sure they have enough staff, sometimes offering as little as an hour's notice. Computer technologies has made always on-call practices easier to employ. But while burdensome for teens, it can be extremely difficult for adults with children. And it makes it harder for workers to have a second job. Given that many low-wage businesses that tend to use on-call scheduling are restricting hours to avoid ObamaCare mandates and other regulations, workers may have set aside a huge amount of hours to come close to full-time work.""People should not have to keep the day open, arrange for child care, and give up other opportunities without being compensated for their time,"" Schneiderman said in a statement.The six retailers join several other, mostly youth-oriented chains, who agreed to similar steps in 2015 as part of the same probe.

Is this still a terrible time to be a department store?Like a white elephant exchange at an office holiday party, it's not clear whether everyone will be happy once all the gifting's done.Among clothiers, Gap (GPS), parent to Banana Republic, Old Navy and its flagship brand, is expected to log a 1.2% same-store sales decline during the December quarter, according to Retail Metrics estimates. Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works parent L Brands (LB) is seen growing comps 1.5%.Handbag makers Kate Spade (KATE) and Coach (COH) are likely to have a merry Christmas quarter with projected comp growth of 6.8% and 2.1%, respectively, while peer Michael Kors (KORS) is expected to drop 4.4%.Overall, early December figures appear sluggish so far.

627,GPS,"The stock market took off thanks to President-elect Donald Trump's agenda of corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation, but the latest headlines signal a likelihood of turbulence ahead as investors examine what JPMorgan analysts call ""radical changes.""CNN on late Wednesday reported that top players in the incoming administration have been kicking around the idea of imposing an across-the-board 5% tariff on imports. Alternatively, team Trump has been weighing support for a House Republican corporate tax change that would indirectly apply a 20% tax on imports, even though it might not pass muster with the World Trade Organization.Trump aides Thursday responded to the CNN report, stressing that no decisions have been made.""The CNN story got a little bit too far out over its skis,"" Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller told reporters. ""The incoming administration is obviously discussing numerous trade deals and tax reform packages with members of our own team as well as members of Congress. But it's too early to go into specific speculation on issues of tariffs or border adjustability.""The report followed the announcement that economist Peter Navarro, who has defended Trump's campaign threat to slap a 45% punitive tariff on Chinese imports, will head a soon-to-be-established White House National Trade Council.On Thursday, shares of major retailers were taking it on the chin. Wal-Mart (WMT) was off 2.3% on the stock market today. Macy's (M) slid 3.6%, Target (TGT) 4.4%, Gap (GPS) 5.4% and Dollar Tree (DLTR) 5.65%. E-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) fell 0.55%. (Retailers also fell on reports of weak holiday sales and traffic).One of the big questions since the election is how Trump will merge his populist campaign themes with a traditional Republican agenda of tax cuts and deregulation. A boost to infrastructure spending and use of the bully pulpit to keep companies like Ford (F) and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), from shutting down U.S. production are two clear ways that Trump aims to stay faithful to his working-class supporters who put him over the top in the Rust Belt. Demanding that Mexico and Canada open up North American Free Trade Agreement for renegotiation is another likely tack. Yet the latest reports offer the clearest indication that Trump may go further than investors have been expecting.It's easy to see why investors are excited about the prospect of a big corporate tax cut. Trump's campaign plan to cut the corporate rate to 15% from the 35% statutory rate could boost S&P 500 earnings by $180 billion, or 16%, figures Jonathan Glionna, head of U.S. equity strategy research at Barclays.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks that stand to benefit from both corporate tax cuts and an infrastructure boost have been among the big winners of the Trump rally. Two of those stocks, Freeport McMoRan and Martin Marietta Materials, are near a buy point. Check out Leaderboard, where IBD's market writers help you find buying opportunities in these and other stocks as they emerge, as well as sell signals to lock in profits.But some companies and sectors could stand to benefit much more than others. Domestic-focused industries like retail and homebuilders, many of which derive 100% of income from the U.S., could see an earnings boost of 30% or more, Glionna wrote, and could get a further boost from a consumer tax cut. Dollar General (DG), for example, could see its 37% effective tax rate (including state taxes) fall to 17% under the Trump plan.Among industry groups, only telecom would get a bigger lift than retail, with AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) seeing a 29% boost in earnings.Yet, retailers could, all of a sudden, become big losers if Trump adopts the House Republican plan. While cutting the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, the House plan would no longer allow businesses to deduct the cost of imports from taxes. That means retailers such as Dollar General, Wal-Mart, Amazon, Costco (COST) and Starbucks (SBUX) would have to pay a tax equal to 20% of the cost of the clothing, televisions, toys and coffee they import.Because retail profit margins are generally in the low single digits, one concern is that retailers that sell a lot of imported goods might have to pass much of those taxes on to customers to maintain their profitability.""Clearly a 20% tax on the wide range of consumer goods that are imported into the United States would put increased economic pressure on families who can least afford it,"" the National Retail Federation said after the House unveiled its ""Better Way"" tax plan in June.Actually, the economic impact of the House plan is far from clear. While imports could be 20% more expensive and exports 12% cheaper, the dollar could appreciate by 15% or more, largely offsetting the tax changes, Deutsche Bank wrote in an analysis this week.Trump and the GOP could be in for a big battle if they build corporate tax reform around this border-adjustment plan. Yet, reform may not be much easier if they choose another path. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that this border adjustment of corporate taxes would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, a huge sum that helps offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% in the House plan. Unless the GOP can get eight Senate Democrats on board, which is doubtful, a tax package passed via reconciliation will have to be deficit-neutral beyond 10 years, so offsets are needed to make the U.S. tax code more competitive.On top of that, there are real worries that other countries will punish American companies if the Trump administration applies tariffs or Congress adopts what looks like a border tax.It's probably safe to say that the stock market rally has downplayed some of these nagging problems in implementing the Trump agenda and that the ride may get bumpy because the range of possible outcomes is wide.As JPMorgan analysts wrote this week, ""While a lot of the early corporate tax reform enthusiasm was predicated on a cursory examination of the headline rate cuts, markets are now examining the radical changes being proposed to the intricacies of the code. (Last) Thursday and Friday saw notable weakness in apparel/retail-linked stocks and a big factor behind the selling was concern around the border adjustment concept that sits at the heart of the GOP corporate tax reform plan.""RELATED:Here's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Could Boost The Stock Market Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

637,GPS,"Defense: Members of Congress warn that the State Department is working on arms accords to demilitarize space and ban anti-satellite weapons, leaving Russia and China with a huge lead in military space capabilities.On Jan. 17, 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement announcing the Obama administration's intention to work with the European Union on an International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities. It was supposed to be sort of a ""rules of the road"" for space-faring nations to deal with issues such as the accumulating space junk jeopardizing satellites and manned space activities such as the International Space Station.It soon became apparent that the vague, loosely worded and allegedly nonbinding accord that would be negotiated would become a pretext to restrict the so-called militarization of space. In 2007, a successful Chinese test of an anti-satellite weapon against an aging weather satellite spewed tens of thousands of pieces of debris into low-Earth orbit, posing a hazard. Space treaty advocates felt that space was getting crowded enough without militarizing it.However, a 2012 EU analysis of the draft code provided to the House Armed Services Committee at the time warned that if the U.S. ""were to make a good-faith effort at implementing the requirements of the draft code,"" it would have an impact on U.S. military operations.The 2007 Chinese test was an early probe by that country to see if it could take out U.S. surveillance, communications and GPS satellites. China is deploying its own GPS, and in a conflict with the U.S. it could knock out ours and retain its own GPS capability.This space accord looms as an extraterrestrial version of the Law of the Sea Treaty, a convention that turns control of the world's oceans over to a global administrative body that would replace the U.S. Navy as the guarantor of freedom of navigation. It would tell us what we could do and when on the high seas.U.S. land-based missile defense systems that intercept warheads outside the atmosphere — meaning space — would fall under the ""space military weapons"" category of the draft agreement. Also affected would be our sea-based Aegis missile defense system.In February 2008, Aegis-equipped missile cruiser Lake Erie succeeded in shooting down a non-functioning satellite that weighed 2.5 tons. It hit the satellite before the satellite struck the Earth and spilled the contents of its nearly full deadly hydrazine fuel. Such capabilities would be considered the militarization of space.Last Wednesday, Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., and Sen. David Vitter, R-La., wrote a letter to Frank A. Rose, deputy assistant secretary of state for space and defense policy, expressing concern that continued pursuit of such an accord would jeopardize national security.""We are deeply concerned by the rising threats of anti-satellite weapons in the hands of states like the People's Republic of China,"" the pair wrote.And well they should be, for it's a capability Beijing is seriously pursuing. China has two ground-based anti-satellite weapon systems, advanced ground-based anti-satellite laser systems, ""and is developing dual-use co-orbital satellites that can monitor or attack U.S. satellites,"" according to Rick Fisher, a China military affairs expert and analyst at the International Assessment and Strategy Center.On July 23, China carried out a test of its Dong Neng-1 satellite interceptor. Adm. Cecil Haney, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, said the test was a further indication of Chinese efforts to ""militarize space."" This follows a May 2013 test of the Dong-Neng-2.When President Obama told the Russians that after the 2012 election he would have more flexibility to gut U.S. missile-defense capabilities, was he speaking of space defense as well?Like the New Start Treaty, we may be subjected to another arms-control agreement that only leaves the U.S. more exposed to its enemies.

702,GPS,"Nike (NKE) hasn't been in the wearables game for two years now, while Apple (AAPL), Fitbit (FIT) and Under Armour (UA) are diving deeper into the space. The athletic apparel titan seems content to focus on its Nike+ app, but a May 3 patent for an ""athletic watch"" might indicate otherwise.The patent's images look a lot like its TomTom-powered Nike+ SportWatch GPS, but that product has already been discontinued. Is the company tinkering with something else?""It definitely seems that Nike is keeping its options open on this front,"" said Macquarie analyst Laurent Vasilescu.Including expired patents, Nike holds more company-filed patents than Lockheed Martin, Pfizer and Ford Motor. And those documents can sometimes reveal a lot about a company's product strategy.""While Apple's not the largest patent filer ... it's relatively easy to gauge what their next product cycle might look like by looking at Apple's patent applications. And I think that also holds true for Nike and Under Armour,"" Envision IP Managing Attorney Maulin Shah told IBD.For a more in-depth look at Nike and Under Armour's patent filings and the secrets they reveal, check out this week's print edition of Investor's Business Daily or read it here.RELATED:Why Nike Has More Patents Than Lockheed, Ford And Pfizer.

703,GPS,"Shares of Children's Place (PLCE) gapped up in the stock market today, a rare bright spot for the retail space after the children's apparel retailer beat first-quarter estimates and boosted its profit forecasts.Children's Place reported a 59% surge in first-quarter earnings per share to $1.32, well above estimates for $1.04 and the best gain going back at least past five years. Net sales also topped views, rising 3.6% to $419.4 million, compared with expectations for $417.59 million. Comps rose 5.1%.The clothier expects full-year earnings per share of $4.17-$4.27, up from an earlier outlook $4.00-$4.10. The more upbeat forecast comes ""despite the challenging environment and continued weakness in store traffic,"" Children's Place said.The full-year outlook includes a 12-cent hit from adverse foreign exchange, ""assumes a low single digit comp sales increase, expansion of gross margin and disciplined expense control.”Still, for the second quarter, the company sees a net loss of 22-30 cents per share, worse than analysts' consensus for 22 cents per share.Children's Place stock rose 4.1% to 71.05 Tuesday after climbing as high as 74.40 in the morning.The stock jumped in March after Children's Place reported fourth-quarter results, but shares began to crumble last month and were driven down further last week amid grim news and forecasts from retailers like Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), Gap (GPS) and Nordstrom (JWN).Macy's stock fell 1.1%, Kohl's 2.7% and Nordstrom 2.3%. Gap, which reports full first-quarter results on Thursday, sank 1.2%. E-commerce sites like Amazon (AMZN), competitive promotions and a mild winter in some areas have hurt retailers' results, although some analysts believe that value chains have an advantage over their upscale rivals.""We believe that the current trend to value over brand is here to stay,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar said in a note about discount apparel chain operator TJX Cos. (TJX) last week.TJX shares rose 0.5% Tuesday after the off-price retailer reported first-quarter results that beat estimates and raised full-year EPS guidance.Five Below (FIVE), a teen-centric discounter, fell fractionally.

704,GPS,"Home Depot (HD) crushed first-quarter estimates and raised its full-year guidance, as customers of the home improvement retail giant paid an extra 2.4% per visit, or an average $60.03 during the period, the company said Tuesday.But its shares fell early on the stock market today after Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome told analysts on the earnings call that sales at stores open at least a year fell from 10.2% in February to 6.7% in March and then to 4.3% in April. Home Depot stock stayed down and ended the trading day off 2.5% to 132.""It does dovetail with a bit of a spending slowdown we saw at a number of retailers that pointed to April being a slower month,"" Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins told IBD.Home Depot is more insulated from the Amazon.com (AMZN) effect than other retailers, such as apparel chains, Perkins said. So its slowing same-store sales at outlets open more than a year aren't as much of a red flag as they are for top chains like Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl's (KSS) and Gap (GPS). Those four retailers reported dismal results last week, sparking a sell-off in the sector.Perkins likes prospects for Home Depot and rival Lowe's this year.""We visited a number of retailers including Home Depot throughout the spring and they and Lowe's (LOW) were the busiest stores we visited,"" Perkins said.Home Depot's adjusted first-quarter earnings of $1.44 a share were up 24.1% year over year, according to figures provided by Thomson Reuters. Revenue grew 9% to $22.76 billion amid continued strong housing market growth, favorable spring weather and sustained consumer spending.Wall Street expected $1.36 earnings per share and $22.39 billion in revenue for the fiscal quarter ended May 1.Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear said in a press release that it was a ""stronger-than-expected start to the year"" and noted it came in ""a quarter marked by week-to-week demand spikes caused by weather variability.""Home Depot raised its 2016 earnings view to $6.27 a share, a penny above analysts' forecasts. It also lifted its sales projection for the year to 6.3% growth to about $94.097 billion, topping estimates of $94.082 billion. The company also projects same-store sales -- sales at outlets open more than a year -- will be up about 4.9% for the year, though that would be below first-quarter same-store sales growth of 6.5%.Shares initially fell more than 2% in morning trading, falling through their 50-day moving average. They recovered somewhat before tumbling even further by the close.After consolidating for nearly three months, the company's stock climbed above a 135.57 buy point on April 18 and rose to a fresh all-time high at 137.82 on May 10 before consolidating again.Jared Wiesel, partner at corporate consulting firm Revenue Analytics noted that the company is focusing on engaging millenials. For example, Home Depot is employing omni-media marketing that employs everything from print to digital.""Their online sales were up 21.5% for the quarter, which is excellent,"" Weisel said.Wiesel said that some investors may be concerned that what would normally be early summer sales were pulled into the first quarter because of favorable weather, which could hurt second-quarter results.""There could be an expectation that this quarter was so strong at the expense of future quarters,"" Wiesel said.Home Depot’s earnings came on the heels of the Commerce Department's announcement on Monday that U.S. housing starts climbed a strong 6.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units, topping estimates of 1.13 million.The government also revised March starts up a bit to a 1.10 million-unit rate from 1.09. The housing starts data and strong April retail sales indicate that economic growth is picking up momentum after getting off to a sluggish start in 2016.""Our view of the macro environment remains consistent. We believe housing data indicates continued tailwinds for our business,"" CEO Menear told analysts on an earnings call early Tuesday.CFO Tome added: ""We estimate weather driven demand positively impacted U.S. sales growth by approximately $250 million.""Lowe's (LOW) is set to announce first-quarter financial results early Wednesday. Analysts predict earnings per share will rise 21% to 85 cents and revenue should jump 5.1% to $14.87 billion. Shares lost 1.2% at the close.

705,GPS,"Walt Disney (DIS), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS), Kohl's (KSS), Fossil (FOSL) and others reported weak earnings or guidance, triggering a broad sell-off in retail and other consumer stocks -- but not for shares of Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) tumbled to a two-year low amid fresh evidence that iPhone demand remains weak. The major indexes ultimately closed modestly lower, with the S&P 500 and Dow industrials falling below key support.The major averages fell for a third straight week, with most or all of the losses coming Friday. The Dow fell 1.2% and the S&P 500 0.5%, both closing below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since Feb. 29. The Nasdaq, already below that key line, retreated 0.4%. The market uptrend remains under pressure. Retail and consumer groups were big losers after a raft of weak earnings reports and guidance from the likes of Walt Disney and Macy's. Oil prices rose to six-month highs during the week.Retail sales rose 1.3% in April, their best gain in more than a year. But that couldn't shake the gloom surrounding retail and consumer stocks.Macy's, Kohl's, Nordstrom (JWN), JCPenney (JCP) and Dillard's (DDS) tumbled on dismal first-quarter reports and/or guidance. Macy's and upscale Nordstrom slashed outlooks after sharp EPS declines. Kohl's posted a same-store sales drop that was the worst ""since the height of the Great Recession,"" according to Retail Metrics.Macy's stock fell 17% to a four-year low, and Kohl's fell nearly 14%, setting to its seven-year worst. Nordstrom, JCPenney and Dillard's lost 18.5%, 8% and 11%, respectively.Meanwhile, watchmaker and seller Fossil collapsed 31% after missing Q1 views and slashing guidance. Fossil hinted at competition from the Apple Watch and other wearables. Gap said Q1 same-store sales sank 5%, with April comps down 7% ahead of its full Q1 results on May 19. Its shares plunged nearly 19% to the worst since late 2011.Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Ross Stores (ROST) also continue the flood of retail earnings next week.The media conglomerate delivered its first earnings miss in five years as per-share profit grew 11% to $1.36 and revenue grew 4% to $12.97 billion, short of consensus. ESPN lost subscribers once again, but the media networks segment didn't appear to disappoint Wall Street too badly. Studio revenue shot up 22% on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Zootopia"" fanfare. ""Captain America: Civil War"" should keep movie box office receipts high in Q2.Disney shares tumbled 4.8% to 100.52, falling out of a cup-with-handle base and well out of buy range. Disney closed just above its 50-day line.Apple stock fell last week amid new evidence that Apple suppliers are seeing weak orders for the upcoming iPhone 7. That suggests Apple's sales woes may continue for quite some time. Separately, Apple will invest $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing service and app. Apple stock fell 2.4% to its lowest level since June 2014 and lost its market cap crown, barely, to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Amazon intensified its rivalry with Alphabet’s Google by launching a new video streaming service comparable to YouTube. Sanford Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner on Tuesday raised his price target on Amazon to a whopping 1,000.Wal-Mart (WMT) announced its subscription service would offer two-day free delivery vs. three days before. But, as brick-and-mortar retailers struggle, Amazon rose 5.3% to 709.92, with investors betting its share of consumer spending will keep expanding.Facebook released guidelines revealing that the social media giant relies far more on people for its ""trending"" news topics, contradicting earlier company claims that they were largely driven by computer algorithms. Earlier, Gizmodo suggested that Facebook was suppressing news stories from conservative media outlets. Facebook strongly denied the allegation, saying it has “rigorous guidelines in place” for its review team, seeking to ensure consistency and neutrality.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he would meet with conservatives to discuss Facebook's policies.Facebook stock rose 0.3% to 119.81 for the week, extending a recent breakout but still in buy range.Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP) called off their proposed merger late Tuesday after a federal judge agreed with the Federal Trade Commission that the deal would have limited office supply competition with big corporate customers. Staples crashed 19%, and Office Depot dropped 40%. The Obama administration has blocked several megamergers recently, including that of Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Analysts say health insurance consolidation could get a hard look, with Aetna (AET) seeking to buy Humana (HUM), and Anthem (ANTM) set to acquire Cigna (CI).The Treasury Department on Tuesday called for greater oversight of the nascent industry, whose quick, easy online payment and lending solutions threaten to upend traditional banking but have raised questions about safeguards and potential for abuse.That came a day after Lending Club (LC) said CEO Renaud Laplanche was stepping down after the company found misconduct within the online lending platform relating to loan sales and lack of financial oversight. Several large and small banks halted work with Lending Club. Shares shed 51%, hitting a record low.Peer-to-peer lending firm Prosper recently announced a large round of layoffs, and disappointing quarterly results from OnDeck (ONDK) have prompted worries over insufficient loan-volume growth.Online gaming platform NetEase (NTES) more than doubled revenue in Q1, beating estimates, boosted by mobile games such as “Fantasy Westward Journey” and newer releases such as “Kung Fu Panda 3.” EPS also topped. Shares rose 9.3% for the week, moving above the 200-day line.Weibo (WB), a Twitter (TWTR)-like social-media platform majority owned by Sina (SINA), fared well, helped by mobile-user growth, strong ad revenue and expansion beyond major cities. Shares rose 2.1% for the week.Online media company Sina itself also topped Q1 views, with better sales and a narrower net loss than expected. The strong Weibo performance was a key help. But ad revenue from its Web portal segment lagged. Shares lost 11.2%, plunging through the 50-day line but closing just above the 200-day.Online retailer JD.com (JD) reported a Q1 loss in line with expectations. Sales surged but were just below expectations, and Q2 revenue guidance was just shy of analysts’ consensus. Shares tumbled 10.2%.LGI Homes (LGIH) on Tuesday reported a surprisingly strong 73% surge in first-quarter adjusted earnings per share. But the entry-level homebuilder's revenue fell short, and gross profit margins declined. LGI Homes, which briefly flirted with a 29.87 buy point, fell 8.9% to 25.69.Trex (TREX), the world’s largest maker of wood-alternative decking and railing products, topped Q1 views. But Trex guided Q2 revenue below consensus. Shares reversed hard, down 9.6% this week.Gypsum wallboard and related products maker Continental Building Products (CBPX) Q1 profit climbed 173%. Shares rose 7.5%, breaking out of a base to a seven-month high. TopBuild (BLD), which installs building insulation, also bested Wall Street Q1 earnings and revenue estimates. Shares of the July 2015 IPO rose 2.8% after the prior week's breakout.Several housing reports, including housing starts and existing-home sales for April, are on tap for next week.SolarCity (SCTY) torched Wall Street’s Q1 sales views late Monday, but losses swelled, and the No. 1 residential installer cut 2016 installation guidance as bookings fell short after Nevada cut net-metering payments to solar customers.Also Monday, rival Vivint Solar (VSLR) reported a 93% revenue rise that still missed views as losses widened.But No. 2 installer Sunrun (RUN) late Thursday reported a surprise Q1 profit ex items, while revenue nearly doubled.SolarCity fell 10.3% for the week, while Vivint was off nearly 8.9%, hitting record lows. Sunrun was down nearly 12%, even with Friday's 7.5% pop.Israeli giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates, but it guided Q2 slightly below consensus. Teva said its $40 billion buyout of the Allergan (AGN) generics business is on track to close in June, despite some earlier delays. Teva stock rose 3 cents to 50.30 for the week.Allergan reported mixed Q1 results -- earnings beat and sales missed -- but the drugmaker said it'll buy $10 billion in stock. Allergan, fresh off a failed takeover by Pfizer (PFE), signaled it'll focus more on improving operations than on making big buyouts in the near future. Shares rose 10.8%.A third generics giant, Perrigo (PRGO), hit a four-year low after its Q1 report on Thursday, though since it issued guidance last month there were few surprises. Perrigo fell 4.4% for the week, working on its fifth straight weekly loss.Smaller player Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed estimates, but its stock rose on news of a deal with two generic drugmakers not to sell knock-offs of its lead drug Xyrem until the end of 2025. Jazz shares closing up 0.9%. Meanwhile, Akorn (AKRX) finally reported its 2015 numbers after a long accounting overhaul, lifting shares more than 20%. It’s set to report its Q1 on May 17.JAB Beech will add Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (KKD) to its coffee empire, paying $21 per share, or $1.35 billion. Krispy Kreme shot up 25% to 21.14 --- slightly above the offer price. JAB Beech, a subsidiary of JAB Holding, owns Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Caribou Coffee, Einstein Noah Restaurant Group and Intelligentsia Coffee. It led an investor group to buy Keurig Green Mountain for $13.9 billion.

706,GPS,"Macy's (M) dismal first-quarter results and guidance Wednesday bolstered views of Amazon's (AMZN) unrelenting dominance, sending shares of the department store chain -- and most stocks in the retail and consumer sectors -- down.Companies ranging from Wal-Mart (WMT) to Michael Kors (KORS) to Nike (NKE) to Tiffany (TIF) to Williams-Sonoma (WSM), sold off. But Amazon stock rose 1.45%, hitting a fresh high.Macy's report followed Gap's (GPS) forecast late Monday of a 5% drop in Q1 same-store sales and weak earnings. The chain also noted a ""tepid macro environment for apparel retail.""""In light of AMZN and M's recent results, we feel more confident that AMZN will displace M as the #1 US Apparel retailer by '17,"" wrote Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Wednesday note, doubling down on his assessment from last year.Macy's earnings fell 29% to 40 cents a share, 4 cents above views, on a 7% revenue decline to $5.77 billion that fell short of estimates for $5.93 billion.Same-store sales -- sales at facilities open more than a year -- at both Macy's-owned outlets and licensed operators dropped 5.6%. For Macy's-owned stores only, comps fell 6.1%.Shares plunged 15.2% on the stock market today to the lowest since December 2011. Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN), which report Thursday, fell 6% and 7%, respectively. JCPenney (JCP), which reports Friday, lost 1.85%. On Monday, it said it topped its own goal for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.IBD's Take: Is Macy's a premium or discount stock? And how does it compare to retail rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupMacy's is still in the best position among its department store peers, said Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins, despite Macy's recent struggles, although ""Amazon is doing so many things that a retailer like a Macy's, Target (TGT), Wal-Mart . . . just aren’t able or willing to do.""Adding to the sell-off was Macy's warning on weak consumer spending. Shares of companies not in direct competition with Amazon dropped as well, including McDonald's (MCD) and Panera (PNRA).""We are seeing continued weakness in consumer spending levels for apparel and related categories,"" Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said in a statement. ""In particular, our sales trend relative to expectations meaningfully slowed beginning in mid-March, and first-quarter results are below our original outlook.""The company now sees full-year per-share profit of $3.15-$3.40, down from its previous outlook of $3.80-$3.90 and far below Wall Street estimates for $3.80 a share. It also expects 2016 same-store sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis to fall 3%-4%, vs. prior outlook for a 1% decline.""We are not counting on the consumer to spend more,"" Lundgren said, so the department store is ""working harder to give customers more reasons to buy from us by delivering outstanding style, quality and value.""For the second straight year, tourist spending is falling in the double digits, he said, and noted a slowdown in some ""center core"" categories. But he also said that the first quarter is a ""relatively small portion of the total year"" and sees a chance to play catch-up over the next three quarters.Still, Macy's isn't exactly the next Sears Holdings (SHLD), which has seen years of falling sales and store closures.""That's a leap,"" laughed Perkins, though he also said the department store's current struggles are more than just a bump in the road.But like Sears, Macy's is evaluating real-estate proposals for joint ventures or similar arrangements. Macy's has been under pressure to spin off its real estate holdings to raise cash.

708,GPS,"Fitbit (FIT) is due for a health checkup late Wednesday and the prognosis for its first-quarter earnings report is looking favorable.But investors got the jitters on the eve of the company's Q1 report. Fitbit stock fell 6.5% to 17.18 in heavy volume on the stock market today. Fitbit stock has tumbled more than 40% this year as competition has risen and the pace of growth has slowed.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the maker of wearable fitness devices to earn 2 cents a share excluding items on sales of $443.1 million. On a year-over-year basis, sales would be up 32% if it meets the consensus forecast. That would be down from 92% growth in Q4, 168% in Q3 and 253% in Q2. Fitbit made its IPO last June, pricing shares at 20.For the current quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Fitbit to earn 26 cents a share, up 24%, on sales of $532.8 million, up 33%.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson on Monday reiterated his sector weight, or hold, rating on Fitbit stock.Erickson expects a “beat-and-raise” quarter from Fitbit, but is cautious based on “longer-term views of poor category user trends, a lack of sensor differentiation and a more limited total addressable market.”In the near term, demand appears relatively healthy for the Fitbit Blaze smart fitness watch and the Alta activity tracker, he said. Fitbit also has stocked the retail channel with Charge HR devices for Mother’s Day sales, he said in a research report.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy maintained her neutral rating on Fitbit with a price target of 16.“While data points during the quarter have been positive, with strong Amazon (AMZN) trends for the newly launched Alta and Blaze models, we remain on the sidelines behind the second-half weighted earnings (we estimate 70% of earnings lie in 2H) and given the tougher product launch comparisons in 2H,” she said in a report Monday.Mizuho Securities analyst Betty Chen kept her buy rating and price target of 20 on Fitbit stock in a report Monday.“Our recent survey highlights increases in Fitbit ownership as well as planned purchase intent at higher average selling prices,” she said. “Moreover, data indicates increased upgrade intent and attachment rate, with 21% of Fitbit device buyers purchasing at least one additional wristband in the last three months. We believe this bodes well for Fitbit’s long-term growth and margin profile.”Last week, diversified rival Garmin (GRMN) said its sales of wearable fitness devices rose 9% year over year in Q1, to $142.4 million, but profit margins declined because of intense competition in the category. Garmin also makes GPS navigation devices for automotive, aviation, marine and outdoor markets.In addition to Fitbit and Garmin, other companies competing in the health-and-fitness wearables sector include Apple (AAPL), Jawbone, Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).RELATED:Fitbit Bolsters China Prospects With E-Commerce Deal

Gap brand comps fell 3%, Banana Republic comps dove 14%, and Old Navy fell 6%.The company also said it is ""entering April with more inventory than planned, which the company expects will pressure its gross margin rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.""Gap's management is optimistic about new merchandise, FBR analyst Susan Anderson wrote in a Friday note. ""However, the turnaround visibility remains low and could be further out than anticipated, given time needed to regain the consumer and a highly competitive environment.""Gap shares had managed to touch their 200-day line in March after taking support at the key 50-day level in mid-February, but Friday's 13.8% dive sent the stock well below the 50-day line.Meanwhile, Victoria's Secret parent L Brands sank 4.3%, following a 2.3% dip Thursday after announcing restructuring plans. Yoga gear company Lululemon (LULU) slipped 1.9%.Michael Kors closed down 4.75% after sinking 4.6% the day before, bringing shares definitively below the 50-day moving average, though the stock remains above its 200-day line.Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) dipped below its 50-day on Friday, falling 3.4% after retaking the key level not too long ago in February.Fellow teen apparel brand American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) shares slipped below their 50-day as well on a 1.1% fall.Express (EXPR) shares eased 1.6%.

773,GPS,"Domino’s Pizza is grabbing a bigger piece of the pie by investing in digital technology to dominate the world's pizza-delivery market.That’s right: world. Domino's (DPZ) opened its 1,000th store in India earlier this month. Last year, it entered Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Georgia, Portugal, Belarus and -- wait for it -- Italy.Fast food pizza ... in Italy? Domino's Chief Executive J. Patrick Doyle told IBD that, yes, Italy invented pizza, but he’s not intimidated.""We think there are some things we bring to the market that are terrific for customers,” Doyle said. That's true even in pizza’s holy land, he says.Domino’s does delivery like no neighborhood pizza shop. By boosting its e-commerce commitment, it’s expanding its franchise network and gaining market share in the U.S. and around the globe. It now has roughly 5,000 stores here and another 7,000 outside the U.S.“Domino’s tries to innovate in everything they do -- especially with technology and engagement with the brand -- you’re not going to find that with most other restaurant brands,” Keybanc Capital Markets analyst Christopher O’Cull told IBD. “I think it’s the best-managed company in the restaurant industry. Starbucks (SBUX) is up there, but Domino’s is one of the top two or three.”O’Cull rates the stock a hold, due to its run-up in valuation, though he says he's had a buy rating on it for a long time.Domino’s pizza chain competitors include Papa John’s (PZZA), Pizza Hut (part of Yum Brands (YUM)) and privately held Little Caesars.Domino’s has been “investing heavily for five years” in technology, said Doyle. Today, Domino’s customers can place orders on a computer or laptop, mobile phone app, through texts, on a smartwatch, from a car through Ford’s (F) onboard computer, using a Samsung Smart TV, and via Amazon’s (AMZN) new Echo, a voice command device. They can also tweet orders via their Twitter (TWTR) accounts, which advertises orders to their followers, an extra benefit for Domino’s.“They’re really at the forefront of pushing mobile technology and positioned to benefit from it,” said Alton Stump, a Longbow Research LLC analyst who spoke with IBD. Stump has a buy rating on the stock.Doyle says that in the U.S., more than 50% of Domino’s customers now order via digital platforms. Other chains are investing in technology too, but it’s hard for local pizza shops to fund such projects. Thus, Domino’s is “really gaining share over those local players,” said Stump.Last October, Domino’s also came out with ""DXP,"" a specially designed pizza delivery vehicle. It’s a version of the Chevrolet Spark that includes a warming oven, GPS navigation and a “puddle light” that projects the Domino’s logo on the ground. Doyle says that so far, 100 DXP’s are purveying pizzas in the U.S.In 2015's third quarter ended Sept. 6, Domino’s reported total revenue rose $38 million or 8.5% to $484.7 million from $446.6 million in the year-earlier period. Net income was up 6.2% to $37.8 million. And diluted earnings per share rose 4% to 67 cents from 63 cents in the year-earlier quarter.The company’s turnaround began back in 2010. Doyle came aboard and he knew the first issue Domino’s had to tackle was the quality of its pizza. The company’s test kitchen got to work and reformulated and improved its product. Then it launched an unusual rebranding campaign, blatantly telling the market that its pizza had been lousy, but it had made dramatic changes.Customers listened and growth took off. Domestic same-store sales for the third quarter of 2015 grew 10.5%, while international same-store sales rose 7.7%, the 87th consecutive quarter of growth in that category. Investors responded. Back on Jan. 1, 2010, Domino's closed at $11.30 a share. It hit an all-time intraday high of $119.73 a share on July 13, 2015. And despite a wobbly stock market, the stock still hovers around $115.“Domino’s has been able to put up really strong same-store sales,” Jefferies analyst Alexander Slagle told IBD. He rates the stock a hold and says that “franchisees have seen 50% growth in profits since 2009.”And Domino’s has just been through the equivalent of its Black Friday: Super Bowl Sunday.“It is often our biggest day of the year, for sure the busiest two hours of the year,” said Doyle. From an hour before kickoff until halftime ends, “we have an order coming in almost every minute at every store, and those orders have typically more than one pizza.” Domino’s also sells chicken, hot sandwiches, bread, desserts and sodas.The profitability of Domino’s franchises makes them an attractive investment. Doyle says that in the U.S., adjusted per-store earnings are “north of $120,000, and the average cost of building a store is $300,000.” Thus a franchisee can “make back the investment in less than three years.”Domino’s had 4,722 U.S. franchises as of mid-June and 376 company-owned stores. The vast majority of the U.S. franchise owners came up through the Domino’s ranks, says Doyle.“We’re an entrepreneurial factory here,” he said.Outside the U.S., in India and elsewhere, Domino’s leverages a Master Franchisee model to expand rapidly.“(Through) Master Franchisees, who sell locations to smaller franchisees, Domino’s can generate a lot of growth and cash with a very asset-light model,” said O’Cull. Then Domino’s can “focus on just managing the brand.”Where will Domino’s deliver next? Africa is poised for pizza growth, says Doyle.“We’re in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa,” he said. “I’m excited about Sub-Saharan Africa. Everyone has a cell phone … and (countries) are going to cell-phone-based payment systems.”He added: “Gross domestic product per capita (in Africa) has been growing for the past decade, and you have a growing middle class.

775,GPS,"Fitbit's (FIT) fourth-quarter earnings report on Monday could be an opportunity for the maker of wearable fitness devices to get investors interested in its story again.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said Fitbit's Q4 report is ""likely a catalyst"" for its shares. She reiterated her overweight rating on the stock but slashed her price target to 24 from 60 on reset expectations for the San Francisco-based company.Fitbit went public on June 18 at 20 and climbed as high as 51.90 on Aug. 5. The stock cratered after a disappointing showing at the CES consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas in early January.On Friday, Fitbit stock fell 2.5% to 15.60 after rival Garmin (GRMN) announced two new fitness wearables that will ship in the second quarter.Garmin introduced the Vivofit 3 daily activity tracker and Vivoactive HR smartwatch. The Vivofit 3 starts at $99.99 and features one-year battery life and automatic activity detection. The Vivoactive HR is a GPS smartwatch with wrist-based heart-rate tracking and costs $249.99.“While Fitbit has clearly been a very challenged stock year-to-date, we remain overweight on the stock into the Q4 print,” Murphy said in a report. “As we are now past the share lockup period, investors should begin looking at fundamentals again.”Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Fitbit to earn 25 cents a share excluding items on sales of $648 million in the December quarter. Sales in the year-earlier period were $370 million.For the March quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Fitbit to earn 23 cents a share on sales of $485 million. In Q1 2015, Fitbit reported sales of $337 million.“We view fiscal 2016 favorably, given already announced new product launches (with more to come), the opportunity on the corporate wellness side, and an attractive multiple entry point into shares,” Murphy said.Fitbit’s newest products, the Blaze smart fitness watch and Alta fitness wristband, are set to go on sale in March.Fitbit faces a host of competitors in addition to Garmin. They include Apple (AAPL), Fossil (FOSL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA).On Wednesday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson reiterated his overweight rating on Fitbit but cut his price target to 31 from 47.“Demand appears steady after the holiday, but days of inventory are higher,” Erickson said. “Our upside bias to numbers remains and valuation is compelling, but we are tempering our expectations for multiple expansion, given inevitably slowing growth in 2016, even as corporate wellness remains a free call option in the name.”RELATED:Fitbit 2016 Outlook An Exercise In Worry For Investors?Fitbit Gets Fashionable With Alta Fitness Wristband.

776,GPS,"Outdoor, fitness and navigation technology company Garmin (GRMN) surprised Wall Street on Wednesday with better-than-expected fourth quarter results, sending its shares almost 17% higher.The Olathe, Kans.-based firm earned 74 cents a share on sales of $781 million for the quarter ended Dec. 26. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Garmin to earn 48 cents a share on sales of $760 million.On a year-over-year basis, EPS and sales were down 4% and 3%, respectively, as Garmin's once-core automotive GPS navigation device business continues its secular decline.The company’s auto segment sales fell 21% year over year to $268 million in Q4.Garmin’s top-performing segment was fitness devices, with sales rising 14% to nearly $229 million.Garmin’s outdoor segment sales rose 6% to almost $124 million. Aviation segment sales jumped 12% to $104 million. Marine segment sales climbed 8% to $56 million.Garmin stock rose 16.6% to 41.06 on the stock market today after the company announced Q4 earnings.On a conference call with analysts, Garmin CEO Cliff Pemble said the company’s investments to diversify from personal navigation devices are paying off. Excluding the auto segment, sales grew 11% year over year. The aviation, fitness, marine and outdoor segments together contributed 66% of revenue in Q4.In the fitness device market, Garmin dominates the high-end running and sports watches segment. But it has been competing more with Fitbit (FIT) and others in the activity tracker business.William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho reiterated his outperform rating on Garmin stock.Garmin’s 2016 guidance was a “source of relief” for investors, Ho said. Its full-year sales target of $2.82 billion was slightly above Wall Street’s consensus. But its EPS goal of $2.25 was 5 cents below consensus. Garmin also announced plans to maintain its current quarterly dividend of 51 cents a share over the next four quarters.“These results were better than investors feared, given the global macroeconomic challenges, competition, pricing pressure and currency headwinds that the company faced,” Ho said. “We were impressed by a solidly executed quarter that led revenue and EPS to be meaningfully above expectations and a solid guide that takes into account a still-challenging environment.”

777,GPS,"Ahead of the key Christmas shopping season, consumer spending wasn't exactly itching to take off, growing just 0.1% in October. Consumer outlays rose 2.9% vs. a year earlier, the weakest annual gain since January 2014, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.Though wages and salaries are up, and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5%, Americans are saving more of their disposable income — 5.6% — than at any time since the end of 2012. It indicates that the U.S. consumer has the means but not the motivation to spend.""Retailers would prefer a higher level of consumer spending,"" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. ""That's not the type of momentum they want to see as we approach the holiday shopping season.""Many stores, including Macy's (M), Gap (GPS) and Signet Jewelers (SIG), have warned on holiday sales.Black Friday may be less important due to earlier promotions, but it's still a huge shopping day.Yet while consumer spending is tepid, other data look good. Personal income rose 0.4%, better than September's 0.2% gain. Wages and salaries rose 0.6%, their biggest gain since May.October durable goods orders rose 3% after two straight months of declines. Gains were widespread, as orders for cars and auto parts rose 2.9%, demand for computers climbed 5.5%, and orders for commercial aircraft such as Boeing's (BA) soared 81%.Core capital goods orders rose 1.3% after the business investment gauge rose an upwardly revised 0.4% in September.Housing remains a bright spot. New single-family home sales rose 10.7% to an annual rate of 495,000, though that was slightly below views. The inventory of new homes for sale rose 1.3% to 226,000, the highest since March 2010. Supply remains about half of what it was during the housing boom. But builders, faced with labor shortages, aren't ramping up construction.Perhaps the greatest promise was in consumer sentiment, which rose among middle- and lower-income households, according to the University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment. Income gains, lower unemployment and falling energy prices boosted sentiment.The consumer sentiment index rose to 91.3 in November from October's 90, but it was below the mid-month reading of 93.1.Simply put, there appears to be enough reason for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates next month for the first time in nearly a decade.""They're going have to let go of their inflation concentration and focus on the general economy,"" said Chris Christopher, director of U.S. global and consumer economics at IHS Economics.

But will mall retailers benefit?Inventories weren't quite as much of a drag as initially reported, which means that business destocking could be a bigger issue on fourth-quarter growth. Notably, retailers including Macy's (M) are reporting excess inventories. Macy's has warned to expect heavy markdowns this holiday season.Year over year, GDP rose 2.2%, the smallest gain since Q1 2014.Consumer spending rose at a solid 3% annual rate after a 3.6% advance in Q2. A healthy jobs market and cheap gas are giving Americans the means and desire to spend. That's helped automakers such as General Motors (GM), e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) via its iPhone 6S and Apple Watch. But so far, most department stores and many apparel chains such as Gap (GPS) have not issued merry holiday forecasts. It seems that Amazon is the Christmas Grinch, grabbing a huge share of holiday retail sales growth.Business investment rose at a so-so 2.4% annual rate.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

831,GPS,"How sweet is it to win a slice of the Apple iPhone 6 business?It should be like candy for analog chipmaker and IBD Leaderboard stock Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a key supplier for the new Apple (AAPL) smartphone.The Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus use chips from Skyworks, Avago Technologies (AVGO) and other firms, according to findings from tech repair firm iFixit, which opened up iPhones bought in Melbourne, Australia.Multiple power amplifier components from Skyworks were found in the iPhone 6 teardowns, Sterne Agee analyst Vijay Rakesh told IBD.In terms of iPhone 6 component suppliers, ""big winners"" are Skyworks, Avago and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) ""with content up 30%-90% from previous iPhone 5s models,"" he said in a research note.Rakesh estimates about $4 worth of content comes from Skyworks in every new iPhone 6. The opportunity for Skyworks, he adds, depends on the number of iPhones Apple sells.He cites Apple's Sept. 22 announcement that it sold over 10 million new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models, a record, just three days after the launch Sept. 19.""Apple is always a big catalyst for all smartphone component suppliers,"" Rakesh said.Stock Amps UpSkyworks' stock on Sept. 19 notched its highest closing price since 2000, ending at 57.68 after the Apple iPhone 6 teardown news. It closed up 3.4% Wednesday to 58.84. But Skyworks powered up well before the Apple iPhone 6 debut. It has gained 106% this year.In an interview with IBD, Skyworks CEO David Aldrich would not comment on whether Skyworks is a supplier for the iPhone 6, although the iFixit teardowns found the technology inside.""I am not at liberty to comment about specific companies,"" he said. ""But Skyworks has become very successful at increasing our content with all of our smartphone customers.""Skyworks develops and manufacturers high-performance analog semiconductor products. Its portfolio includes amplifiers, attenuators, battery chargers, circulators, DC/DC converters, demodulators, detectors, diodes, directional couplers and infrastructure RF (radio frequency) subsystems.Its semiconductors enable wireless connectivity in smartphones, tablets and other devices.Leveraging core technologies, Skyworks supports automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, energy management, GPS, industrial, medical, military, wireless networking, smartphone and tablet applications.Skyworks has been on a roll on the financial front. It's seen double-digit sales and earnings growth in all but one of the past seven quarters. Its growth accelerated in the most recent quarter to the fastest pace since mid-2011. Earnings rose 54% to 83 cents a share. Sales climbed 35% to $587 million.Connectivity Is The KeyWhat's been fueling growth at Skyworks?""Fortunately for us, the growth is being driven from both a market and product standpoint,"" Aldrich told IBD. ""We've worked very hard over the past decade to diversify our business into a broader set of markets and to produce more products and solutions. At the core is connectivity in all its forms, whether that is through a smartphone or an automobile or the home, which is becoming increasingly connected in many ways.""He said on a July conference call for Q3 of fiscal 2014: ""Our business results are being fueled by a surge in global adoption of connectivity in all its forms across a diverse set of end markets. We are riding a wave of powerful underlying market forces, all enabled by the availability of efficient, high-performance connectivity solutions.""Among these forces, he said, are ""the enabling of billions of unconnected users with first-time Internet access in the emerging economies; advancing new forms of content delivery, such as streaming music services, on-demand media and over-the-content distribution; and supporting cloud services and mobile ecommerce.""Skyworks' technology has its largest presence in smartphones, Aldrich told IBD.In the past couple of quarters, smartphones and tablets have been big growth drivers, he adds, whether it's increasing Skyworks' content in these products by providing more complete solutions or by gaining market share.""In general, smartphones are becoming more complicated and complex,"" he said. ""They need to operate over many frequencies having more functionality.""Skyworks provides a lot of the technology that goes into the more sophisticated smartphones such as solutions that support GPS and high-resolution cameras.Another growth driver: ""Skyworks has been very successful at capturing developing economic markets like China and penetrating new regions of the world that are deploying connectivity in a big way,"" said Aldrich.He points out that Skyworks is penetrating markets outside Europe and North America, with many Chinese buying smartphones for the first time.As for the future: ""Skyworks is entering a new and exciting growth phase driven by global wireless proliferation and the Internet of Things,"" said Aldrich in a statement announcing Q3 results. ""Quite simply, we are capitalizing on the macro trend to connect virtually everyone and everything, all the time. Our high-performance analog solutions and system-level integration capabilities coupled with our operational agility and scalability are enabling us to connect the previously unconnected.""Skyworks is a part of IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. It has the highest Composite Rating in the group, with a 99 out of a possible 99.Key customers include Cisco Systems (CSCO), General Electric (GE), Google (GOOGL), Honeywell (HON), Nokia (NOK) and Samsung Electronics.

836,GPS,"Audio and infotainment equipment maker Harman International Industries (HAR), an IBD Leaderboard stock, continues to score wins with high-profile customers, according to recent news reports.On Thursday, AutoWeek reported that the Harman/Kardon audio system will be standard in Daimler's (DDAIF) new Mercedes-Benz SL400, which AutoWeek says ""will now be the most affordable way to get into an SL-class on this side of the pond.""That news followed another report on the PhoneArena website that said Harman products will be included in the new Sharp Aquos Crystal smartphone.PhoneArena, a media site devoted to wireless technology, said the phone is equipped with a Harman Kardon sound effects engine when in headset mode as well as native compatibility with the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio Bluetooth speaker.These wins continue a recent run of good news for Harman, which has delivered four straight quarters of double-digit sales growth and five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Much of that growth has come via deals to provide audio gear for cars and smartphones.The Stamford, Conn.-based company makes audio products, lighting solutions, GPS systems and other gear to the consumer and commercial markets, as well as digitally integrated audio and infotainment systems for the automotive industry.Its brands include JBL, AKG, Harman/Kardon, Infinity, Mark Levinson, Revel, Lexicon and Selenium.As reported this month in IBD's New America section, investors seem to have shrugged off concerns about Harman's competitive position after Apple (AAPL) agreed to buy Beats Music, a subscription streaming music service, and Beats Electronics, a maker of headphones, speakers and audio software.Beats was founded by hip-hop legend Dr. Dre and music producer Jimmy Iovine. As part of the $3 billion deal, Iovine and Dr. Dre joined Apple.Harman's shares slipped more than 1% to 106.34 on May 28, the day the Apple-Beats deal was announced. But the stock has since recovered — touching a nearly seven-year high of 118.60 on July 14 — and now trades near 115.The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 97. It is the second-highest ranked in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronics group.Harman is an Apple partner as well as now a competitor.Zacks Equity Research said in an early-August note that ""Harman continues to expand due to its partnerships with the likes of Apple and Google (GOOGL), which is a significant positive. However, intensifying competition from Sony (SNE) remains a concern.""The analysts added that Harman has started integrating Apple's CarPlay and Google's Automotive Link into its embedded infotainment solutions. They also noted that in the latest reported quarter, Harman won contracts from Alfa Romeo, Hyundai, Kia and Toyota (TM), and expanded its relationship with Ford (F).Related: Car Systems Drive Growth At Audio Gear Maker Harman.

838,GPS,"Now that mobile phones have become the official documentarians of the 21st Century — recording everything from important messages to civil unrest to your teenage r's 4,000th selfie — you don't want to risk losing all that data by losing your phone.That's become much less of a problem thanks to the cloud. It allows users to store photos, videos, music files and other content in a secure environment that doesn't get lost when your phone does.As more wireless carriers provide Internet cloud-based services to customers, there is greater demand for companies that offer cloud-based storage solutions.One of those companies is Synchronoss Technologies (SNCR). It provides a cloud platform to carriers and software-based activation for connected devices worldwide.Most of Synchronoss' revenue comes from online activation services for mobile devices, such as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone.Synchronoss' software allows mobile network operators to connect devices or plans into networks. The company, which serves large clients such as AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ), gets paid a transaction fee for each activation.An increasing chunk of Synchronoss' business comes from the cloud side, where it gets paid every time a mobile operator's subscriber signs on to cloud services that are provided by Synchronoss.CEO: It's About ContentThe cloud service is important because of the value consumers place on mobile phone content, says Synchronoss CEO Steve Waldis.""If anything gets stolen or lost, all that data is backed up for you,"" he told IBD in a phone interview. ""These days people value the content on the phone almost as much as the phone itself.""Only a few years after launching its cloud business, Synchronoss now boasts more than 33 billion entities in its cloud, including 5 billion photos, 10 billion address book contacts, 125 million videos and more than 300 million music files.Those numbers keep growing.""Every week around the world we sign up more than 100,000 new subscribers,"" Waldis said.The company's cloud products include Synchronoss Personal Cloud, which allows subscribers to back up content on their phones.Personal Cloud comes embedded on most new smartphones and devices direct from the manufacturers, Stacie Hiras, Synchronoss' vice president of marketing and communications, said in an email.""This is gaining more usage and adoption, as it's built into the flow to activate the phone,"" she said.Other cloud products include Synchronoss WorkSpace, which lets business employees access and edit documents stored in the business cloud; and Integrated Life, an ""Internet of Things"" platform that lets users connect and activate smartphones and tablets, and provides services for connected homes, automobiles and health and wellness devices.Recent wins include a deal, announced Aug. 5, in which Synchronoss will provide Integrated Life services for Time-Warner Cable's (TWC) IntelligentHome brand.This is TWC's entry ""into the home automation market, which allows customers to control and automate lights, thermostats, security alarms, video surveillance cameras and more,"" Tavis McCourt, analyst at Raymond James, said in a research note.A day later, Timex announced the launch of a cellular-connected GPS ""smartwatch,"" called the Ironman One, that uses Synchronoss cloud-based services. Synchronoss also developed the watch's mobile applications and Web portal.Cloud Builds RevenueDuring the second quarter, Synchronoss' cloud revenue grew 74% from the prior year to $46.7 million, topping most analyst expectations. Cloud revenue represented 45% of the total, up from 31% the previous year.""We believe SNCR has positioned itself nicely to help the tier 1-2 wireless carriers better position themselves in the evolving consumer and commercial cloud business,"" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty noted in a report.Overall Q2 revenue climbed 22% from a year earlier to $103.6 million, continuing a years-long run of double-digit gains on the top line. Results also topped consensus estimates for $102.5 million.Earnings for the quarter rose 32% to 41 cents a share, a penny above views.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 27% in 2014 and 18% in 2015.Synchronoss' stock price shot up nearly 15% to 39.72 when Q2 results were reported on July 29. Shares have continued to rise since then, reaching a nearly seven-year high of 44.43 intraday Friday.""Each quarter that SNCR continues to produce better-than-expected cloud revenue is helping convince investors that have been sitting on the fence,"" Auty said.Working The WorldOne of Synchronoss' growth strategies is to continue expanding its international presence. More than 100 carriers worldwide use its full suite of products, Hiras says, and more than 30 use the Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform.The company broadened its global footprint in July when it acquired France's Voxmobili, a provider of address book personal cloud solutions to leading mobile operators such as AT&T, Airtel and Orange.The buyout allows Synchronoss ""to move into new areas,"" CEO Waldis said. ""Voxmobili combines our core technology and increases our distribution.""In addition to growth in Europe, he says Synchronoss has also seen ""very strong growth rates in Asia.""The company's M&A strategy focuses on small deals.""In the past we've done small tuck-in acquisitions that have been technology driven,"" Waldis said. ""Most are small privately held tech companies. We are also looking for efficiencies. We haven't really done anything that has been transformational.""

843,GPS,"ChipmakerSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) is poised to significantly expand its global presence as well as its profit margins over the next two years, according to an analyst report released late Monday.As Chinese telecom carriers transition from 2G phones to 3G smartphones and 4G LTE wireless broadband services for customers, Skyworks is likely to have a strong presence in what will be a big market.""We anticipate a growing global mix of LTE smartphones and Skyworks' share gains with leading Chinese OEMs should drive 15% plus sales growth into the smartphone market over the next two years,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley in a research report. ""The potential dollar content available for Skyworks increases from roughly 30 cents to 50 cents in a 2G phone to $2 to $3 in a lower-end 3G smartphone to $4 to $6 for a midtier LTE smartphone and to $10-plus for high-end global LTE smartphones,"" he said.Walkley increased his target price on Skyworks stock to 62 from 55, and reiterated a buy rating.Skyworks stock was flat, near 52, in midday trading in the stock market today, but shares are up more than 80% this year for a company that has been in the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks for weeks, as well as an IBD Leaderboard stock.""Given Skyworks' broad RFIC (radio frequency integrated circuit) portfolio and customer base, we believe Skyworks' diverse analog portfolio is enabling content share gains in its smartphone customer base,"" Walkley said. ""Further, we anticipate strong ongoing sales to Wi-Fi 802.11ac, wireless infrastructure, and the IoT (Internet of Things) markets should contribute to strong sales and improving margins.""The report was released after meetings with Don Palette, Skyworks' chief financial officer, at a Canaccord investor conference last week.The Woburn, Mass.-based company has a diverse portfolio of analog chips used in cars, broadband gear, cellular infrastructure, energy management, GPS devices, smartphones and tablets.Skyworks chips are used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone and Samsung Galaxy F4 and F5, but recently its chip growth is being driven in part by fitness wearables, such as Philips ' (PHG) wearable technologies and wellness applications, and by home automation, JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna told IBD.""They're in a lot of new automobile applications,"" Gauna said. ""The automobile is so sensor-intensive now, with a lot of RF (radio frequency) and analog content that Skyworks can provide.""New product launches and an aggressive push into new markets have helped drive recent revenue growth. For its fiscal Q3 ended June 30, Skyworks posted year-over-year revenue growth of 35%, its biggest growth in more than three years.""While we understand investor concerns regarding slowing smartphone/handset unit sales growth, we believe investors do not fully appreciate Skyworks' diverse content opportunities, increasing mix of higher-margin integrated mobile solutions vs. stand-alone power amplifiers, and improving competitive position,"" Walkley said.Skyworks products, for instance, will help enable navigation-assist capabilities in some of next year's Volkswagen (VLKAY) models and will go into Ericsson's (ERIC) 4G LTE mobile broadband base stations. Skyworks chips are going into enhanced video-streaming applications for TV set-top boxes, Blu-ray/ DVD players and LED/4K television.Skyworks also sees promising opportunities in medical devices, gaming platforms and industrial markets.RELATED:Worldwide smartphone market grows in Q2.

864,GPS,"Summer was fun, but autumn is closing in. It's time for students to start getting geared up. Following are some ideas for tech gifts to ease the pain of getting back to the grind for your college-age, or younger, student.
"
865,GPS," There might be hundreds of Bluetooth speakers on the market, but the audio purists among us still swear by a good old integrated amplifier or receiver hooked up to a decent set of speakers.
"
866,GPS,"Technical Pro's RX35U receiver and speakers provide the component experience at an affordable price. The receiver, about $120, has an FM tuner and inputs for a smartphone, a tablet or even a turntable. The SPH4 bookshelf speakers we tested it with are small (about 7 x 7 x 10 inches), so they fit almost anywhere and at $60 are affordable.
"
867,GPS,"Technical Pro, like many vendors, lists these components with unbelievable output ratings, but the combination sounds really good, and when cranked up, it's loud enough to get your dorm neighbors' attention.
"
868,GPS," Lots of students go back to school with a new tablet, but a laptop is a better choice for tasks, such as preparing long reports, that require lots of typing. Game playing is better on a laptop as well, especially if it's a new Lenovo Y40.
"
869,GPS,"With high-end Radeon M275 graphics and an Intel (INTC) Core i7 central processing chip, a bright 14-inch screen and top-mounted JBL speakers, the laptop lets your student really get into a game. That is, when he or she is finished studying.
"
870,GPS,"Our review unit was the entry-level model with a 500 GB drive and was priced at $799. Other models in the lineup offer larger hard drives and more memory, and range in price up to $1,149.
"

"
872,GPS,"With pockets for everything you could possibly think of, including a well-protected front drop-down for a camera and even a rain cover to protect the Boa Flow during a downpour, this heavily padded pack is perfect for carrying an expensive laptop.
"
873,GPS,"If your student is returning with a new tablet, the $60 STM Link shoulder bag is perfect for any 10-inch model. With multiple pockets for the tablet, keys, a phone and sunglasses, the Link is perfect for a student who wants a tablet nearby at all times.
"
874,GPS," College students drink a lot of coffee, but few want to go through the bother of actually making a cup — it's easier to just pay the money and have someone else do it.
"
875,GPS,"With Keurig's (GMCR) $99 K10 Mini Plus Brewer, brewing coffee or tea one cup at a time is as easy as popping in a K-Cup (numerous brands and types of coffee and tea can be found at many supermarkets and stores), selecting a cup size (6, 8 or 10 ounces), pouring in some water and pushing a button. In less than two minutes, your student will have a fresh cup of coffee or tea, and be ready to go back to studying.

The V.ALRT Personal Emergency Response Device, from VSN Mobil, is a button-sized module that ties into any Bluetooth 4.0-enabled smartphone. When pressed, it can send an emergency message that your student has programmed, along with his or her GPS location, to as many as three people or emergency agencies.

880,GPS," Print may be passe in some circles, but today's students need a device that does a lot more than just print. That's why MFPs (multifunction printers) remain popular. Epson's new WorkForce WF-7610 MFP prints, scans, copies and faxes, and does it all with paper and documents up to 11 x 17 inches.
"
881,GPS,"The $249 WF-7610 features automatic duplexing in printing, copying, faxing and scanning modes, and can generate prints as large as 13 x 19 (the WF-7610 does not duplex print at this size) to let your student create poster-size presentations, charts and spreadsheets. With a WF-7610 in the dorm room, your student will become the ""go-to"" when anyone needs an out-of-the-ordinary print, scan or fax.Summer was fun, but autumn is closing in. It's time for students to start getting geared up. Following are some ideas for tech gifts to ease the pain of getting back to the grind for your college-age, or younger, student. There might be hundreds of Bluetooth speakers on the market, but the audio purists among us still swear by a good old integrated amplifier or receiver hooked up to a decent set of speakers.Technical Pro's RX35U receiver and speakers provide the component experience at an affordable price. The receiver, about $120, has an FM tuner and inputs for a smartphone, a tablet or even a turntable. The SPH4 bookshelf speakers we tested it with are small (about 7 x 7 x 10 inches), so they fit almost anywhere and at $60 are affordable.Technical Pro, like many vendors, lists these components with unbelievable output ratings, but the combination sounds really good, and when cranked up, it's loud enough to get your dorm neighbors' attention. Lots of students go back to school with a new tablet, but a laptop is a better choice for tasks, such as preparing long reports, that require lots of typing. Game playing is better on a laptop as well, especially if it's a new Lenovo Y40.With high-end Radeon M275 graphics and an Intel (INTC) Core i7 central processing chip, a bright 14-inch screen and top-mounted JBL speakers, the laptop lets your student really get into a game. That is, when he or she is finished studying.Our review unit was the entry-level model with a 500 GB drive and was priced at $799. Other models in the lineup offer larger hard drives and more memory, and range in price up to $1,149. If you're sending your student back to school with a new laptop or tablet, why not add a new carrying case? The $229 Booq Boa Flow Graphite backpack probably costs almost as much as some laptops, but it's one of the most deluxe backpacks on the market.With pockets for everything you could possibly think of, including a well-protected front drop-down for a camera and even a rain cover to protect the Boa Flow during a downpour, this heavily padded pack is perfect for carrying an expensive laptop.If your student is returning with a new tablet, the $60 STM Link shoulder bag is perfect for any 10-inch model. With multiple pockets for the tablet, keys, a phone and sunglasses, the Link is perfect for a student who wants a tablet nearby at all times. College students drink a lot of coffee, but few want to go through the bother of actually making a cup — it's easier to just pay the money and have someone else do it.With Keurig's (GMCR) $99 K10 Mini Plus Brewer, brewing coffee or tea one cup at a time is as easy as popping in a K-Cup (numerous brands and types of coffee and tea can be found at many supermarkets and stores), selecting a cup size (6, 8 or 10 ounces), pouring in some water and pushing a button. In less than two minutes, your student will have a fresh cup of coffee or tea, and be ready to go back to studying.There's even a College Edition model available for $20 more in the school colors, and school decal, of several popular universities, with more coming soon. Though no one likes to dwell on them, bad things sometimes happen.

882,GPS,"Federal policy is upshifting toward self-driving cars as automakers and tech companies from Apple (AAPL) to Volvo race to build them, with the Department of Transportation planning to update its position in weeks.With safety and traffic at stake, the agency is also moving toward requiring all new cars to be equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication technologies.""I expect the changes to our approach to autonomous vehicles will come out within the next several weeks,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told IBD in a press conference call Monday afternoon. And ""we expect the proposed rule on vehicle-to-vehicle technologies to come out before the end of this administration, so certainly within the next year.""Foxx made the remarks on the heels of last week's passage by Congress of a five-year transportation bill that, among other things, requires revision of the five-star safety rating system to reflect whether a vehicle has crash-avoidance systems such as automatic braking and lane-change monitoring.Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has been among the most vocal proponents of self-driving car technology, with the Autopilot system on Tesla electric vehicles that he personally tests. Its technology, which can currently do automatic braking and keep a car in lane, is deployed on about 40,000 Model S sedans and Model X crossover SUVs.Plenty of other carmakers also are far down the road to automation with ""active safety"" technologies. And a raft of tech companies are involved in self-driving car and connected-car partnerships with automakers or each other. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), for one, said Monday that it has completed its merger with Freescale Semiconductor (FSL). Both are active in connected cars, as is visual-computing chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), a partner to Tesla and helping to power the Volkswagen (VLKAY) Audi self-driving car. Other chip and tech companies in the game include advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) makers Ambarella (AMBA) and Mobileye (MBLY).Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google was an early player in developing its own self-driving car, and is also testing some technology on vehicles from Toyota's (TM) Lexus division.Smart City ChallengeMonday's DOT press conference was called to introduce a $50 million smart-transportation contest for midsize cities that runs through early 2016. The Smart City Challenge aims to ""create a fully integrated, first-of-its-kind city that uses data, technology and creativity to shape how people and goods move in the future,"" the DOT said in its announcement. Some $10 million of the prize is being contributed by Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Inc.""Some of the types of things we're looking at are technology elements such as the extent to which communities are willing to engage autonomous vehicles, connected vehicles and intelligent transportation systems,"" Foxx said. The DOT also will look at the use of analytics, smart grids, roadway electrification and electric cars.In its vision for future cities, the DOT is ""imagining connected and autonomous vehicles that can practically eliminate crashes,"" he said, ""and interact with wireless infrastructure to eliminate traffic jams.""Intelligent TransportationAutomakers have been keeping tabs for a long time on where such ""intelligent transportation systems"" are headed — linking up highway infrastructure with car communications to route traffic, for instance.Ford (F) showed off traffic jam-thwarting ""intelligent vehicle technology"" as far back as 2011, at a Los Angeles press event, in which specialized Wi-Fi and GPS warning systems helped cars avoid collisions while driving around Dodger Stadium.""Here we're using very low-cost GPS technology. We get all this information from every other car out there,"" Mike Shulman, Ford's technical leader for active safety research and innovation, told IBD in the ride-along then. ""Your car would be sending and receiving these messages.""The DOT started testing vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology, or V2V, with a 3,000-car deployment in 2012. About a year later it released a policy on automated vehicle development, launching research ""so that the agency has the tools to establish standards for these vehicles, should the vehicles become commercially available,"" according to the policy paper.Tech companies and carmakers or a consortium of them could potentially become part of a smart-city contest submission.""I think there will be all kinds of partnerships discussed,"" Foxx said in the news conference.Not Ready For RobocarsNot everyone's on board with the idea of taking active-safety technologies to the next level — that is, to self-driving cars, which already are allowed to be tested in several states with a professional driver. In a letter Thursday to the heads of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the public-interest group Consumer Watchdog lobbied regulators to go slow at writing any new rules allowing self-driving cars.""Self-driving robot cars are not ready for public use, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must not rush to implement regulations covering the vehicles as it updates its policy on automated vehicle technologies,"" the group wrote.RELATED: Consumer Group Warns On Robot Cars; Tesla Goes There

On Wednesday we get the FED mins and although I do not think we will learn anything new - it will be a key to the action amid concerns over what the FED will decide to do in 4 weeks.  On the earnings front, retail giants Wal-Mart  (WMT), Home Depot  (HD), Target (TGT), Staples (SPLS), and Best Buy  (BBY) are among the companies due to report their quarterly results this week.Take good care.

927,GPS,"Retailers likely suffered sluggish September sales, as unseasonably warm weather cooled spending on fall apparel, and a volatile stock market made consumers more cautious in their buying.As of Wednesday, analysts were expecting September sales at stores open at least a year to slip 0.2% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.The final tally for the month will be released Thursday.If retailers turn in a drop in same-store-sales for September, it would mark the second straight monthly decline and third in the last six months, Perkins noted. August same-store sales fell 1% from a year earlier.The forecast for a weak September showing suggests only a so-so finish to the back-to-school shopping season, which ran from late July to mid-September.""(Back-to-school) spending appeared uneven and skewed to necessities,"" Perkins said.Costco Wholesale (COST), which is expected to report results late Wednesday, is forecast to post a 1% decline in September same-store sales. If correct, it would be the second such drop in a row for the giant warehouse-club operator, and third in the last four months, Perkins noted. But Costco's core September U.S. same-store sales, excluding gas and foreign-exchange effects, are expected to be a much healthier 5.2% gain.Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) is estimated to lead the pack with a 4.1% rise in September same-store sales.Last Thursday, drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) posted a 1.5% increase in September same-store sales, below views for a 1.9% rise.PriceSmart (PSMT), which owns and operates Costco-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, said early Wednesday it saw a 3.2% gain in September same-store sales, ahead of views for a 2.8% increase.Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) is expected to see a 1.6% decline in September same-store sales.Regional discount chain operator Stein Mart (SMRT) is forecast to show a 0.7% decline in September same-store sales.Teen apparel retailer Buckle (BKE) is expected to report the month's same-store sales slipped 2.5%.

Garmin's $330 Forerunner 235 GPS running watch fills a ""significant gap"" in its product lineup, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a report Wednesday. He rates Garmin stock as neutral.""Garmin has historically shied away from optical heart rate monitors, believing them to be less accurate than chest-worn straps,"" Anderson said. ""But the popularity of on-wrist monitors (from Fitbit (FIT), Apple (AAPL), Jawbone, Sony (SNE), Motorola, Samsung, etc.) has made it a necessary competitive feature.""Earlier this year, Garmin released the $300 Forerunner 225 running watch with a heart-rate monitor licensed from Mio. Garmin developed its own optical heart-rate monitor technology, called Garmin Elevate, for the Forerunner 235.""We are hopeful that over the next year, Garmin will refresh all of its fitness products to include this new (heart-rate monitor) technology — including activity trackers such as the Vivofit and Vivoactive,"" Anderson said. ""At the moment, we believe Garmin is at a competitive disadvantage to Fitbit by not having the technology on at least one of its activity tracker products.""Garmin announced two other running watches on Wednesday, but neither includes an optical heart-rate monitor. They are the $250 Forerunner 230 and $400 Forerunner 630.""The reason Garmin did not equip the higher-end device (630) with an optical HRM is due to the fact that the company believes this device will be purchased by the high-end runner that prefers accuracy (chest strap) and due to a decision to pack the 630 and companion chest strap with extra sensors for measurements such as ground contact time,"" Anderson said.The three new running watches will ship later this quarter. All three can receive call notifications and text, email, and audio alerts via a smartphone connection. Those capabilities are also found in Apple's Apple Watch, which has health and fitness features.Garmin stock was up 1% to above 34 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.RELATED:Garmin sinks on another full-year guidance cut.Fitbit signs up 20 new corporate wellness clients.

956,GPS,"General Motors (GM) may early next year start testing self-driving cars in lower Manhattan, a setting that could allow GM to advance and commercialize its autonomous technology at a faster pace.XTesting in the densely populated and challenging streets of New York City will hasten the process of deploying self-driving cars at scale, said Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise Automation, GM's recently acquired self-driving car unit, which has applied for permission to test the emerging technology. Cruise already has self-driving test cars on the road in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Detroit.The fleet of self-driving Chevrolet Bolt electric cars from GM will be tested in Manhattan in a ""geofenced"" area, meaning it is marked off with virtual boundaries using GPS technology. The test cars are Level 4 vehicles, meaning they are fully self-driving and can operate without a human driver under certain conditions.However, they will have two personnel on board for oversight, GM said.A Deutsche Bank analyst recently said the auto giant may have an edge over rivals in the race to take self-driving cars mainstream, though another analyst downplayed GM's technology edgeGM shares slipped 1.6% to close at 45.02 on the stock market today but are still up 30% year to date and have advanced 24% since its Sept. 1 breakout from a cup-with-handle base with a 36.73 buy point. Ford Motor (F) rose 1.2%, Tesla (TSLA) advanced 1.5% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) lost 1.9%.IBD'S TAKE: GM stock has displayed impressive relative strength in recent weeks, but can it continue to hold above this key benchmark often seen in the best growth stocks?Automakers are jostling with technology companies as the momentum behind driverless cars continues to grow. Alphabet (GOOGL), like GM, is testing self-driving cars in California and Arizona.Nvidia (NVDA) last week unveiled a new AI-driven computer for fully autonomous vehicles and will partner with a German logistics giant to test a fleet of self-driving delivery trucks next year.While GM will be the first to conduct ""sustained testing"" of fully autonomous cars in New York, Audi of America performed New York state's first self-driving demo in June, according to the New York State governor's office, which on Tuesday announced Cruise Automation has applied to begin the self-driving tests.RELATED:Nvidia Shares Jump As Chip Leader Debuts Computer For Self-Driving CarsAutomotive Industry News, Self-Driving Cars And Stocks To WatchAnalyst Dismantles GM Narrative Of Tech Edge That's Boosted Stock

957,GPS,"More than 9 million posts on Facebook's (FB) Instagram get the hashtag #selfiesunday, 6 million-plus are marked #selfienation, about 275 million are tagged #selfie, and 302 million are simply tagged #me.So is it any surprise that products like Make Up For Ever's ""Ultra HD"" foundation, Temptu's airbrush foundation kits, or Pur Cosmetics' ""Love Your Selfie"" palette exist?""Millennials have a mindset of being 'selfie-ready,'"" Piper Jaffray analyst Steph Wissink told Investor's Business Daily. That has helped drive lip and eye products to become two of the best-performing cosmetic categories for the last three years, she says, highlighting that the beauty sector's growth tracks ""almost exactly"" with the rise of smartphones and mobile devices.Camera-friendly cosmetics — once the realm of news anchors and movie stars — are now mainstays at specialty beauty stores Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora. But as Amazon (AMZN) continues to suck up more dollars from consumers, brick-and-mortar chains are increasingly latching on to the social media-driven fire for cosmetics and skin care products, which are proving to be a glimmer of hope for a surprising range of shops trying to lure Instagram-savvy shoppers.Last year, cosmetics, skin care and fragrance made up a $37.7 billion market in the U.S. vs. $266.8 billion in apparel and footwear sales, according to Euromonitor research. But beauty has been the fastest-growing retail segment for at least the last three years, outpacing apparel, footwear, food, in addition to being one of the fastest-growing segments online, said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.Echoing that trend, Ulta continues to crank out double-digit same-store sales gains — 14.4% in its most recent quarter — while the Gap (GPS) and Macy's (M) each posted comps of negative 2% in their latest reports, while Nordstrom (JWN) reported a 1.2% decline. Their respective stocks have followed the diverging sales trajectories as well.IBD'S TAKE: Robust and reliable growth appeals to institutional investors, so it's not surprising that Ulta has seen eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, four typically better-performing mutual funds have reported a position in the stock.The major chains have taken notice, and are looking for a makeover with some social-media flair.Retail icon Macy's, which by Cowen & Co.'s estimates will be overtaken by Amazon next year as the biggest U.S. clothing seller, is planning to open more in-store locations of luxury beauty retailer Bluemercury, a 2015 acquisition, and is expanding its brand assortment beyond traditional prestige names to include smaller labels.And for any shoppers who bought $35 in Rampage accessories, the nation's largest department store also recently offered a free selfie stick.""Beauty is the new hoodie, in terms of being a product that works well with social media,"" said Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, noting that retailers are looking for categories that are less vulnerable to promotions and unseasonable weather. ""You can't deny the power of social media. On average, someone will spend over 15 hours a week on social media.""Social media help shape and stimulate new trends, he added, as well as educate others about those trends. Makeup lovers now scour Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube for contouring tips and skim hashtags for brow-shaping tutorials from the seemingly endless parade of self-appointed beauty gurus with a domain name and an Instagram account.Department store beauty counters remain a fixture but are in particular danger of losing relevance in this digital age. NPD Group said that compared to two years ago, 11% more women are doing cosmetics product research online.By the time the customer enters the store, she's frequently past the product research stage, says Wissink. ""She walks in, she says 'I need palette 212,' and (the salesperson) goes 'Wait a second, don't you want to see our lip, our eye (products)?'""The social-media driven shift in habits means retail heavyweights have to enhance the store experience. In fact, chains that previously had no service aspect are adopting in-house experts to guide customers through the beauty aisle.For example, CVS Health (CVS) now has in-store beauty consultants and last year upgraded its makeup and skin care offerings in a few thousand locations. In its August earnings call, CEO Larry Merlo said the drugstore chain was focused on shifting its assortment toward health, beauty and store brands, all of which are higher-margin segments.And Target (TGT) features a ""beauty concierge,"" clad entirely in black and available to answer questions about the big-box retailer's brands.""It's meant to create retail theater,"" said Wissink, noting that customers ""crave that tactile in-store experience.""Shoppers enjoy sampling new products in store, and the quest for a Holy Grail blush can become a day out with the girls. In the process, it's not uncommon to snap a selfie and send it to a friend — or to Twitter (TWTR) followers — for immediate feedback.For their part, premium brands like Estee Lauder and Clinique are loosening their grip on exclusivity as they accept that shoppers like to sample different brands from a variety of retailers.They've broadened their distribution to specialty retailers like Ulta and lower-tier department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP), which nixed creating a whole new in-store beauty experience in lieu of bringing in an already-successful titan: Sephora.Its in-store Sephora locations were among the department store's top-performing divisions, the company said in its Q2 earnings release in August, and there are plans for more Sephora shop-in-shops to drive beauty-revenue growth.""Seems like everyone's trying to get a piece of that pie,"" said FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""It's working, at least for Sephora and Ulta, so everyone jumps on the bandwagon.""And as beauty products increasingly drive traffic to stores, chains that traditionally haven't sold them are now testing them out.A Barnes & Noble store seems like a peculiar place to open up a beauty counter, but it may be inclined to seize trends early, given that Amazon laid waste to book sellers.The Glossary, as it is cleverly called, is a college-focused shop-in-shop stocked full of makeup and skin care products from Smashbox, Burt's Bees and other millennial-friendly brands, not far from the Jane Austen paperbacks and math textbooks needed to survive freshman year. Barnes & Noble College — a subsidiary of Barnes & Noble Education (BNED) -- has rolled out the pilot program at a handful of locations, including Emory University, Southern Methodist University and the University of California at Riverside.""(It's) similar to what they did a few years ago with coffee shops,"" said NPD's Grant. Barnes & Noble wants shoppers ""to browse, to know that they can hang out."" After all, the longer retailers can get customers to stay in the store, she said, the better the chances of them buying something.Apparel stores like Urban Outfitters (URBN) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are also cultivating nascent beauty offerings. Teen retailers have broadly been trying to reconfigure their identities now that their millennial consumer base has grown up and out of midaughts trends.Urban's curated ""Back-to-School Beauty"" collection showcases a small mix of products, including trendy Korean brand Tonymoly and uberhip Milk Makeup. (Besides select Urban Outfitters, the only other place to buy Milk in a store is Sephora.) In its mid-August earnings call, Urban Outfitters management called out the strength of its beauty segment, as well as its home and intimates divisions.American Eagle's foray into the beauty space has been more hesitant, though it may have more up its sleeve. Its Aerie Global Brand President Jennifer Foyle noted in American Eagle's May earnings call that the company has assembled a team ""to venture into the beauty business, but we are going to walk before we run."" It, too, sells Tonymoly face masks, plus some assorted Aerie-branded lotions and body washes.Rolling out new display cases is one thing, but building up a healthy following on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram is another.Out of all of its department store brethren, Nordstrom has the strongest social presence, with 2.1 million Instagram followers to Bloomingdales' paltry 608,000 and J.C. Penney's 300,000 follower count. It was one of the first major companies to incorporate Like2Buy into its Instagram profile, allowing customers to click through and buy the pictured products.All of them pale in comparison to Sephora's 8.8 million followers and Ulta Beauty's 2.4 million Instagram devotees. Still, the department stores are seeing progress at the cash register.Nordstrom's summer ""Glam-Out Days"" offered free makeup tips and services during its yearly ""anniversary sale"" event. According to Piper Jaffray research, beauty products had the highest sellout rate during the promotional period, with 51% of Nordstrom's makeup and skin care products selling out, up from 30% last year and 8% in 2014.""One of the things that makes beauty important within department stores is (that) it's a gateway,"" said Grant. ""It helps the retailer attract other consumers, whether it's apparel or footwear. One of the things they've used the beauty space to do is carve out new consumers or drive traffic through the rest of the store.""RELATED:Beauty's A Hot Industry, But Does That Make E.L.F.

958,GPS,"Apple (AAPL) once again released quarterly financial results without disclosing how many smartwatches it sold in the period.The Cupertino, Calif.-based consumer electronics giant details how many iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sells, but not the Apple Watch. It combines Apple Watch results in its catch-all ""Other Products"" category, which also includes iPod, Apple TV, Beats headphones and other accessories.Apple late Tuesday said revenue in its Other Products category fell 22% year over year to $2.73 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 24. The period included just nine days of sales of Apple's second-generation smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 2, which came out on Sept. 16.Wall Street analysts parsed the data and tried to determine how many watches Apple sold in its September quarter. Based on 10 analysts who estimated Apple Watch sales, the consensus is that Apple sold 2 million units in fiscal Q4.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 78, meaning it has outperformed 78% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But IBD believes there are stocks with greater potential for big gains for investors to consider. IBD's Leaderboard features a select group of such stocks.Baird was the outlier on the high side, estimating that Apple sold 2.9 million watches last quarter. Deutsche Bank and UBS had the lowest estimates at 1.1 million units.On Monday, research firm IDC estimated that Apple shipped 1.1 million smartwatches in the calendar third quarter. IDC tracks shipments, not sales, and had one more week in its figures than Apple's fiscal Q4.The IDC report had Apple in first place for smartwatch shipments with 41.3% market share, followed by Garmin (GRMN) (20.5%), Samsung (14.4%) and Lenovo (3.4%).In July, after Apple announced June quarter earnings, the consensus on Wall Street was that Apple would sell 2.4 million smartwatches in the September quarter.At least eight analysts made estimates for Apple Watch sales in the December quarter. The consensus among those analysts is that Apple will sell 4.7 million smartwatches in the holiday sales quarter.Apple stock fell 2.3% Wednesday on its mixed fiscal Q4 results.On a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he is happy with sales of the Apple Watch Series 2 so far.""We're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smartwatch, packed with new features including built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display and a powerful dual-core processor,"" Cook said. ""Individuals and businesses alike are recognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated and connected.""RELATED:5 Takeaways From Apple's Mixed Q4 Earnings ReportLower-Priced Apple Watch 1 Might Outsell New Apple Watch 2 This Holiday

959,GPS,"The major averages were mostly in the red in early afternoon trading Friday, as a disappointing jobs report weighed on stocks.The Nasdaq was down 0.3%, the S&P 500, 0.2% but the Dow Jones industrial average was flat. Volume was mixed, tracking higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Thursday.U.S. employers added 156,000 new jobs in September, the Labor Department said, below economists' forecasts for 168,000. The unemployment rate rose to 5.0%. Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester called the numbers ""solid"" and said she still supports a rate hike.Meat products, paint makers and solar stocks led the decline in today's stock market action. The meat products group sank 5%. Tyson Foods (TSN) gapped down and lost 9% before finding support at its 200-day moving average. Shares fell below a 70.54 buy point and gave up a 9% gain from the entry. Pivotal Research Group cut its rating to sell from buy and cut its price target to 40 from 100, citing a class-action lawsuit filed last month against the poultry processor.Gold miners, discount retailers and other apparel-related stocks were among the few gainers. Gap (GPS) vaulted 14% in massive trade, surging above its 50-day and 200-day moving average lines for the first time in over a month. The clothing retailer reported better-than-expected sales in September. Same-store sales fell 3% vs. analyst forecast for a 3.6% drop.In the IBD 50, Acacia Communications (ACIA) gapped down and fell 6% in heavy volume to test its 50-day moving average for the second time this week. The fiber optics company priced a follow-on share offering at 100.LGI Homes (LGIH) and Penske Automotive Group (PAG) were each down more than 4% in above-average turnover.On the upside, Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) gapped up and rose 4%, popping back above its 50-day line in fast trade. The chip designer, which reports results Oct. 27, said it expects Q3 revenue to increase 11% to 13% sequentially, well above its prior outlook for flat to 5% growth.RELATED:U.S. Added So-So 156,000 Jobs In September, Won't Change FedSilicon Motion Previews Better-Than-Expected Q3 Sales, EarningsTyson, Chicken Stocks Broiled Over Price Collusion Lawsuit

960,GPS,"The stock market saw mild morning losses expand a bit by lunchtime on Friday, but the decline masked a nice rebound by leaders in the brick-and-mortar space. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continued to struggle in the wake of bearish commentary by Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 slipped around 0.6%, while the NYSE composite fell 0.7%, hurt by sharp losses in aerospace, steel, paint, meat-product and toy stocks. Small caps slid harder; the Russell 2000 was off more than 1%. Volume was mildly lower on both exchanges vs. the same time Thursday.Airplane-components giant TransDigm (TDG) dropped nearly 2% to 280.73 and slid further below its 50-day moving average in volume running quadruple average trade. Failure to hold above the 50-day line would result in a sell signal; the stock initially broke out of a long saucer with handle at 233.87 on May 10.TransDigm is falling in sympathy with Honeywell (HON), a former Dow 30 component that is on pace for a weekly drop of more than 9% after issuing weak sales and profit guidance for the full year. The stock, at 105.95 is trading below the 40-week moving average for the first time since early March.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%, seeing drops of 1 point or more in at least six of its 30 component stocks including Home Depot (HD). The home improvement chain giant has struggled to rebound back above its 200-day moving average since crashing below it on Sept. 9.Tesla, the big stock market winner in 2013 to 2014, fell more than 1% to 197.33 in heavy volume. While the leader in all-electric vehicles failed to surpass upside resistance at the 200-day moving average, it also isn't giving up much ground considering that the stock is still above recent lows of 187.87 in late June and 193.45 on Sept. 13. Watch to see if the stock can find support near the 200 price level.Tesla's RS Rating of 12, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, continues to be terrible since it reflects the stock's poor action over the past 12 months vs. all other companies in IBD's database. Meanwhile, Tesla's 50-day moving average has crossed back below the slower-moving 200-day moving average, a bearish sign.Tesla is still forecast to report its first profit in eight quarters when it releases third-quarter results, likely in early November. The Street on consensus expects earnings of 7 cents a share, but the range of estimates of 15 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters varies widely, from a net loss of 46 cents to a net profit of 60 cents.On the upside, Nordstrom (JWN) defied the skeptics of mall-based retail selling, rallying more than 1% to 54.58 for a fourth straight gain.The stock is still more than 30% below an all-time high of 77.65, yet it's certainly on the verge of snuffing out a shorter-term downtrend. Notice how the stock has traded relatively tightly for six weeks, forming a long handle on a long, deep cup base. While the stock is still nearly 22% below a 52-week high near 70, aggressive traders could consider an entry point at 53.81, 10 cents above the long handle that recently formed.Nordstrom is likely gaining ground on upbeat earnings guidance for the third quarter from clothing rival Gap (GPS). Gap stores tend to be in the same mall locations that are anchored by large department store operators such as Nordstrom and Macy's (M).Gap gapped up in price, rising more than 14% to 26.17 in whale-like volume to jump back on the north side of its 50- and 200-day lines. It too is trying to fashion a bottoming-style base pattern since hitting a multiyear peak of 46.85 back in September 2014.RELATED:What Is A Bottoming Base?

961,GPS,"U.S. stock indexes suffered routine losses Friday afternoon as the market neared its final hour of trade.The Nasdaq slouched 0.2%, while the S&P 500 matched that loss. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat, but the small cap Russell 2000 dropped 0.7%. Volume in the stock market today was running slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.The Dow Jones utility average delivered one of the day's better gains, up 0.6%. A weaker than expected payrolls report might have helped the dividend-paying utilities, but the utilities were also due for some kind of rebound.Consolidated Edison (ED) had dropped 10 sessions in a row, making Friday's gain a trivial triumph. Southern Co. (SO) fell nine sessions in a row, and it too rose Friday. The two utilities rose about 2% and 1% respectively but then reversed to nominal gains.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, five of the day's nine top gainers were from retail or the related apparel makers groups.Gap (GPS), the owner of the namesake and Old Navy chains, thrust 15% as it retook its 200-day and 50-day lines in huge volume. September sales were a bit more than expected. Francesca's (FRAN), another retailer in the same apparel/shoes group, popped 2%. The stock cleared a 16.30 buy point in an awkward pattern. Volume was below average.Other retailers doing well included department store Nordstrom (JWN), which added to Thursday's breakout; Best Buy (BBY), which climbed closer to an entry in a flat base; apparel maker PVH Corp. (PVH), which padded a recent breakout; and big box retailer PriceSmart (PSMT), which advanced 3% as it tries to build the right side of a pattern.On the downside, the day's worst performer was Food-Meat Products. Allegations that the poultry industry conspired since 2007 to fix prices rattled the group. Tyson Foods (TSN) dropped 9%; Sanderson Farms (SAFM), 6%; and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC), 5%.RELATEDU.S. Added Just 156,000 Jobs In September; Won't Change FedOil Rig Count Rises, But Texas Plays See Dips

962,GPS,"In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirtsleeves next to a turned-down king bed. ""Good morning, Siri,"" he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted.""Your home is ready to rise and shine,"" the virtual assistant replied.Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, Calif., Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar (LEN), was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad.Tap your phone, and AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30,000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple's free HomeKit app.As iPhone sales growth  slows, Apple (AAPL) is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN).The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of model homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells?Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn't hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem — and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets.""We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,"" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing. ""The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.""The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn't come cheap. A single motorized, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage ""touch-screen deadbolt,"" which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot (HD) -- and there's always hiding a key under the flower pot.In Fremont, Calif., about 15 minutes from Facebook's (FB) headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home (KBH) is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the color of the light underneath a vanity.With the words ""good night,"" the light turns purple. With a ""good morning,"" it switches to white.KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2,000, ""which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,"" according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn't include $30,000 worth of gadgets.Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties (BRP) and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale.Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that's a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020.For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day.""Give me a break,"" he said. ""That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There's too much crap out there, it's only diluting stuff that's really cool.""Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target (TGT) opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture.In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie — made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant's breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home's lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents.You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail — or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck.""The smart home will get there but it's not there yet,"" Reck said. ""Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.""As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada.When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do.""Certain devices obey, and some do not,"" Giesler said.Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand (IR).Lennar's Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a ""halo effect,"" helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a ""cool"" alternative to an existing one.No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Fla.With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it's time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog.Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system.Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart-home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds.""I'll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds — apparently it's just too much for me at that point,"" Bieber said. ""I'm so used to saying things and they just happen.""Related:No Need To Ask Jeeves When You Can Ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook, GoogleHomebuilder Confidence Cools As Housing Market Takes A BreakApple iPhone 7 Makes Big Q3 Impact In Just 2 Weeks Of Sales

"
1002,GPS,"Its gross profit margin is seen slipping to 53% in Q3, impacted by geographic revenue mix shifting toward countries with weaker currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and pricing dynamics, mostly in the fitness segment.

1016,GPS,"A Marine Corps motto is ""Improvise, Adapt and Overcome."" Similarly, organizations that can quickly spot a challenge or opportunity faster than their competitors and respond effectively are likelier to deliver results, says Pamela Meyer, author of ""The Agility Shift."" She notes that Gap (GPS), the established clothing firm, is closing 175 stores in North America, while Zara, ""its more agile counterpart, is thriving.""
"
1017,GPS,"Bill Jensen, author of ""Future Strong,"" adds that 40% of today's Fortune 500 companies will not exist in 10 years.
"
1018,GPS,"Tips on adapting your company and people to challenges:
"
1019,GPS," Deputize employees. Agile leaders, teams and organizations do not miss opportunities or slow their response time because ""they are waiting on approval, or for someone with the correct job description to become available,"" Meyer emphasized. Effective executives hire and coach others to lead and respond to opportunities and challenges as they arise.
"
1020,GPS," Cross-train them. A solid way leaders at all levels become more agile, Meyer said, is to regularly seek out new opportunities and assignments: ""UPS (UPS) and many other organizations have a recruit-from-within policy that is designed to ensure their leaders rotate through a wide range of experiences, from package delivery to leading a team in another country. Such experiences build competence and capacity to be effective when things don't go as planned.""
"
1021,GPS," Get smarter. Meyer suggests creating a web of relationships and resources to respond to unexpected challenges. When they arise, ""there is not always time to gather and analyze complex data,"" she said. ""It is through their relational web that agile people tap their wider resources, knowledge and expertise to respond effectively. The time to discover and build this relational web is not in the midst of crisis, but through their day-to-day interactions.""
"
1022,GPS,"Meyer adds that outfits of all sizes employ resources ranging from Google (GOOGL) groups to corporate social networks. These help the firms' people tap their relational web and access the skills, knowledge and talent they need.
"
1023,GPS," Recognize. When evaluating performance, value and reward agility and learning, as they go a long way toward reinforcing winning behavior, says Meyer.
"
1024,GPS," Jump outside comfort zones. To realize your firm's limitless capacity, ""you must disrupt and reimagine those systems, long before best practices are established or all the risks have been mitigated — that takes leadership courage,"" Jensen said.
"
1025,GPS,"He notes that multinational management consulting giant Accenture (ACN) is eliminating its formal yearly review process for its 330,000 people, with CEO Pierre Nanterme making that leap so that his company can select the right person rather than solely measuring and evaluating people by numbers or statistics.
"
1026,GPS," Shoot for the moon. When your company has a problem or anticipates a challenge, apply what Google calls Moonshot Thinking, says Jensen. The title is gleaned from JFK's call to do the impossible and land a man on the moon.
"
1027,GPS,"Push your team to solve a massive problem. This could result in doing something cheaper and faster. Regardless of the outcome, your people could make a big difference.
"
1028,GPS," Learn from your workforce. Jensen suggests putting together a three-month task force to call out the top 10 things that should be blown up and changed by 2020.
"
1029,GPS,"His prediction: ""Be prepared to embrace at least seven or eight of their top 10 recommendations.""A Marine Corps motto is ""Improvise, Adapt and Overcome.""

It also trotted out the Microsoft Band 2 wearable fitness tracker and demonstrated its still-in-development HoloLens holographic computing glasses.Microsoft wants to change the perception that it is a ""rounding error"" in the mobile device landscape, FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note Tuesday.""While the new hardware products look impressive, it all comes down to consumer adoption as Microsoft aggressively tries to change its consumer image,"" Ives said.

But Microsoft has priced its devices at a premium to Apple.The 12.3-inch Surface Pro 4 starts at $1,029 with a keyboard cover, compared with the $999 starting price for the 13-inch MacBook Air.The 13.5-inch Surface Book starts at $1,499, compared with $1,299 for an entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro.Microsoft's second-generation fitness band, the Microsoft Band 2, plays in a space between Fitbit (FIT) activity trackers and the Apple Watch smartwatch. It costs $250, the same price as a high-end Fitbit Surge GPS watch, but less than the $349 starting price of the Apple Watch.Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said Microsoft's fall product launch didn't change his bearish view on Microsoft.

For an analysis of the stock's recent performance, read the article titled ""Can Fitbit Hold Its Fledgling Breakout?""A report out Thursday from Parks Associates showed that 18% of U.S. broadband households own a wearable fitness device such as a smartwatch or a fitness tracker.Parks said 12% of U.S. broadband homes own a fitness tracker, such as those made by Fitbit and Garmin (GRMN). That's up from 10% in the third quarter of last year.Adoption of smartwatches with fitness features doubled to 8% in the demographic from 4% in Q3 last year, Parks said. Apple (AAPL) dominates the smartwatch with its Apple Watch. Apple released a second-generation version of its Apple Watch last Friday.""Adoption for fitness trackers and smartwatches continues to accelerate,"" Harry Wang, senior director of research for Parks Associates, said in a statement. ""Our research shows that there is little overlap between these two sets of owners, and smartwatch owners are more likely to use the device during rigorous activities such as running, biking or swimming.""The newly released Apple Watch 2 capitalizes on such user needs by adding GPS and waterproof functions, a smart move by Apple,"" Wang said.Device abandonment continues to be a concern in the fitness wearables market.After one year of ownership, 17% of fitness tracker owners quit using the device, Parks said. That compares with 8% of smartwatch owners who quit using the device after a year.Baird analyst William Power on Wednesday reiterated his neutral rating on Fitbit stock, with a price target of 16.""Our quarterly activity tracker survey suggested slightly lower overall interest in activity trackers, though Fitbit's share and brand loyalty remained strong and grew year over year,"" Power said.

1107,GPS,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Autonomy and artificial intelligence, driven by advances in the commercial sector, will be key to ensuring the U.S. military maintains its advantage, a top defense official said Wednesday.AI is becoming ubiquitous in the form of Apple's (AAPL) Siri, Facebook's (FB) Messenger bots, Amazon's (AMZN) Alexa voice assistant and IBM's (IBM) Watson computer. Meanwhile, companies like Tesla Motors (TSLA) and MobileEye (MBLY) are also making leaps in autonomous driving technology.""Because they are commercially available, all competitors will have it,"" Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work said of autonomy and AI. ""This is going to be a competition of fast followers.""The true advantage will go to the nation that can integrate the technology better on the battlefield, he added, noting that Germany spent the interwar period exploiting radio technology and advances in aviation to devise ""blitzkrieg"" tactics.Speaking at the Air Force Association's Annual Air, Space and Cyber conference, Work said he's confident the U.S. can be a leader in putting all the pieces together, but also warned the military needs to be more agile.Apple shares finished flat in the stock market today, Facebook climbed 1%, Amazon rose 1.2%, Tesla added 0.3% and Mobileye gained 2.55%.IBD'S TAKE:  On the civilian side, the Transportation Department finally unveiled long-awaited guidelines that establishes a national framework for the operation and deployment of self-driving vehicles earlier this week. The Pentagon is looking to a ""third offset strategy"" that will help U.S. forces keep their edge over adversaries. But unlike prior ""offsets"" like nuclear weaponry and GPS satellites, the next one will be derived from the commercial sector and not the military.The Defense Department realizes it's a slow-moving, government agency vs. rapidly developing, informal, creative tech firms. So Defense Secretary Ash Carter is trying to mend a strained relationship between the DOD and Silicon Valley.He opened a Defense Innovation Unit- Experimental outreach office in Mountain View, Calif., last summer and one in Boston earlier this year, with another one planned for Austin, Texas.

1108,GPS,"Action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO) received at least five price-target hikes to its stock after it announced its first flying-camera drone and a new lineup of cameras Monday. But analysts and investors remain skeptical about the firm's prospects.GoPro stock fell nearly 7% to close at 14.26 on the stock market today. Shares rose 2.3% Monday but the stock is down nearly 60% in the past year.FBN Securities raised its price target on GoPro to 15 from 13 and maintained its sector perform rating.Goldman Sachs upped its 12-month price target on GoPro to 14 from 12.50, but kept its neutral rating.Piper Jaffray raised its price target to 9 from 6.50, but stayed at underweight.Baird increased its price target to 15 from 10, but remained at neutral.Wedbush Securities was more sanguine about GoPro's prospects. It raised its price target to 17.50 from 14.50 and reiterated its outperform rating.IBD'S TAKE: GoPro stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 40, meaning it has been outperformed in key metrics by 60% of stocks over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 8 out of 11 companies in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronic industry group. To see which company leads the sector, check out the IBD Stock Checkup.Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski sees a ""favorable setup"" for GoPro heading into the holiday shopping season. GoPro exited the second quarter with a clean channel inventory and the new products look compelling, she said in a research report.GoPro on Monday introduced its Karma quadcopter and new high-end and midrange cameras.The top-of-the-line Hero 5 Black is the first update to the flagship camera in two years and costs $400, which is $50 less than the model it replaces.

It will sell bundles with a camera for a discount. Karma with a Hero 5 Session will cost $1,000 and Karma with a Hero 5 Black will cost $1,100. Karma goes on sale Oct. 23.""The drone market, which we estimate at $2 billion, is still early in its growth trajectory and the remains up for grabs,"" Jankowski said. ""GoPro should be able to leverage its strong consumer brand name, significant retailer shelf space and global distribution footprint to gain share.""GoPro competes in the drone market with DJI, 3DR and others.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said the price-to-battery life relationship with Karma is not as favorable as the competition.""From a battery perspective, the Karma has 18 minutes (of run time), which compares to the peer average of 24 minutes,"" Murphy said in a report. ""Additionally, we averaged the current price point of Karma's peers (with integrated cameras) and found average selling prices at $705 (vs. $1,000 and $1,100 for Karma).""Karma will face stiff competition from DJI's Phantom 4 drone, which sells for $1,199, FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi said in a report. Unlike the Phantom 4, Karma does not have object-avoidance or ""follow me"" technology, he said in a report.Karma was optimized for portability and ease of use, GoPro said. It also features a removable stabilizer that can be used as a handgrip for GoPro cameras.Baird analyst William Power said Karma is an attractive product priced at a premium level.""Karma looks like a strong first-generation drone with flexibility of use, camera placement and portability among its highlights, though priced at the higher end of the consumer market,"" Power said.

The controller features takeoff and landing in one button. There's also a return to home button.""People are going to be surprised at how easy Karma is to fly,"" Woodman said during the webcast event.IBD'S TAKE: GoPro stock is trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bullish technical sign. It could be working on a possible 16.35 buy point. But current market conditions have increased risks for investors.GoPro's new drone will compete with such companies as DJI, Yuneec and 3DR.At Monday's event, GoPro also announced its next-generation action camera, the Hero 5 Black, for $399. The device is waterproof without a casing, has voice controls, image stabilization, built-in GPS, improved audio recording and a 2-inch touch screen.

1137,GPS,"The FDA on Thursday afternoon approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) potential blockbuster cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi, which the company priced at $259,000 per year, on the high side of investors' expectations.
"
1138,GPS,"The agency gave the nod to Orkambi, a combination of ivacaftor (which Vertex markets separately as Kalydeco) and lumacaftor, a booster that makes the drug effective in treating a much larger population than ivacaftor alone.
"

"
1140,GPS,"However, the improvement that Orkambi yielded in clinical trials was smaller than Kalydeco's, which led to a widespread expectation that Vertex would price Orkambi lower than Kalydeco's $312,000-a-year mark. A buyside investor survey conducted by Evercore ISI on Monday found that the mean expected price was $235,000 while the median was $250,000, so the eventual $259,000 price was a bit on the high side.

After discounts, Kalydeco costs an average of $220,000 a year.In a conference call with analysts, Smith noted that an estimated 35% to 40% of homozygous F508del patients are on Medicaid, a higher percentage than the group taking Kalydeco, suggesting the population is poorer.Vertex has an assistance program in place, called Vertex GPS, to help ensure that patients will be able to afford this pricey medicine; Chief Commercial Officer Stuart Arbuckle says that most Kalydeco patients pay less than $50 a month out of pocket, and Vertex plans to continue the strategy with Orkambi.Arbuckle says that the lift-off for Orkambi will likely be slower than it was with Kalydeco.""The uptake with Kalydeco was as fast as any product I've personally been involved in — we got to about 90% of eligible patients in about nine months,"" Arbuckle said. ""With Orkambi, while we expect to get very, very strong demand from both physicians and patients, just the sheer volume of patients leads us to believe that the time to peak is going to be longer.""Arbuckle notes that while each of the 275 CF centers in the U.S. averaged only three or four patients eligible for Kalydeco, they will have 30 apiece hoping for Orkambi.Trading on Vertex stock was halted just before noon ET as the news broke, after the stock rose nearly 4% in morning trading. When it resumed trading at 3 p.m. ET, Vertex stock was up 4%, above 131. The stock touched a record high of 137.50 on April 23.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

1167,GPS,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) beat on both the top and bottom lines in its second quarter and raised full-year profit guidance -- so why are shares down Friday?The beauty retailer has consistently delivered strong numbers. In Q2, same-store sales growth accelerated to 14.4% from 13.9% in Q1, and up from 12.5% in Q4, 12.8% in Q3, and 10.1% a year earlier. Meanwhile, Gap (GPS) and department stores like Nordstrom (JWN) have posted negative comparable sales (-2% and -1.2%, respectively, in their most recent reports).The one blemish on Ulta's Q2 was the company's earnings guidance for Q3 -- a range of $1.25-$1.30 vs. consensus for $1.29 -- which might have dampened some enthusiasm.Still, Ulta's recent track record of outperforming retail peers has started to stir some disdain, at least online. But Zacks Research Equity Strategist Tracey Ryniec tweeted that some investor-commenters on StockTwits were ""getting more hostile"" amid Ulta's success ""because they don't 'get' the biz.""When asked whether it's male investors who aren't getting it, she replied:@IBD_elow Yes.

IBD University has a few tips on when to take profits.The reaction from Wall Street analysts has been more positive. Nomura upped its Ulta price target to 287 from 244, and Cowen raised its target to 286 from 265 late Thursday following earnings, days after Piper Jaffray bumped up its target to 290 from 250.Lofty expectations appear to have gotten the better of Ulta on Friday, particularly as its previous three quarterly reports have prompted big gap-ups. And analysts note that high valuation is prompting some investor pushback.""We believe Street's high expectations were likely already priced into the shares ahead of the solid print, and we would be buyers on weakness,"" wrote Cowen's Oliver Chen, who has an outperform rating on the stock.Meanwhile, other Ulta metrics continue to shine.

1168,GPS,"Pokemon Go has racked up some amazing numbers since its July 6 launch: nearly 55 million U.S. users in its first month, including a peak of about 21 million daily active users spending more than a half-hour a day playing the game that's free to download.The most impressive number of all may be the billions of calories burned by kids out to catch the Nintendo (NTDOY) anime creatures. Yet there's one number that's bound to underwhelm: its impact on GDP. And that's nothing new when it comes to today's breakthrough technologies and products.Technological innovation is making people richer, but not necessarily in ways that pay the bills. In terms of good-paying jobs, it's had a bite-size impact since the dot-com boom.A common feature of some of today's most transformative tech innovations is that the end users often don't have to pay anything. SocialFlow, a social media management company, estimated this spring that the free publicity that Donald Trump's presidential campaign got from social networks like Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat was equal to $380 million in paid advertising.Among the reasons that the U.S. economy has been in a prolonged growth slump is because of the way GDP is measured. GDP excludes what is known as the consumer surplus, which is how much value people derive from something in excess of how much they have to pay.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook may not be generating many jobs by historical standards of innovative companies, but it's been lucrative for investors. The social networking giant broke out of a base with a 121.18 buy point in late July. The stock moved sideways until breaking out again from a short consolidation with a 128.43 entry point. Click here for Facebook stock chart analysis.While the consumer surplus is hard to quantify, some economic analysts think it's huge.""By our usual GDP measurements WhatsApp is worth nothing ... or perhaps $100 million (if measured in terms of the income of its engineers). And yet there's some 1 billion people getting some to all of their telecoms and communications needs from this service,"" wrote Forbes columnist Tim Worstall, a fellow at the London-based Adam Smith Institute.While millions of people are playing Pokemon Go for free, many others are spending money on in-app purchases to help speed their progress in the game. The most up-to-date stats reveal that the mobile game has grossed $440 million worldwide, meaning Pokemon Go has eclipsed the earnings of some summer blockbuster movies.That sounds pretty huge, but when you consider that 500 million people have downloaded Pokemon Go, and 30 million to 40 million have played the game for about a half-hour each day, the spending comes out to something less than 50 cents for an hour of play — roughly one-tenth of the cost of an hour at the movies.Although it's unclear whether the Pokemon Go craze contributed to the summer movie slump, it is clear that people are deriving a lot more in value from the game than they are paying out of pocket. Shortly after the game's launch, researchers Michael Farren and Adam Millsap at George Mason University's Mercatus Center figured that Pokemon Go players were easily getting more than $7 in value for every $1 spent — ""even if the average consumer surplus is only a measly dollar an hour.""It's worth considering that playing Pokemon Go requires the GPS capability that comes with every smartphone and that we all now take for granted. In his 2012 book,  ""Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think,"" XPrize founder Peter Diamandis offered a reminder of just how much we take for granted. Taking decades-old list prices for the GPS, videoconferencing, digital voice recorder, video camera, digital camera, encyclopedia, music player, video game console and everything else that comes included, he calculated that there's more than $900,000 worth of applications in every smartphone.The implication is that traditional measurements vastly understate the impact of recent technological innovation in boosting our quality of life. Yet, when it comes to the things most people think of when they think about financial well-being — the number of good-paying jobs and the size of the economic pie as defined by GDP — the current era of technological innovation has fallen short.Technology leaders such as Apple (AAPL), Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have transformed how we connect — to friends, politicians, businesses and information. So you'd expect to see a dramatic impact on employment and output.Yet in those terms, the companies don't compare to some older industries.Apple, Google and Facebook, three of the largest companies by market capitalization, combined, employed only about 185,000 worldwide at the end of their 2015 fiscal years. By contrast, General Motors (GM) had 653,000 U.S. workers at its 1979 peak.Facebook's 12,691 employees generated $17.9 billion in revenue in the latest fiscal year, or $1.4 million per employee. Alphabet, despite staffing up to pursue other bets that so far amount to less than 1% of its revenue, generated $1.2 million per worker.When Alphabet releases a Google Maps update, it can go to everyone with relative ease. When General Motors introduces a new model, it has to retool factories, make each car or truck individually, then transport them to far-flung dealerships for sale. All of that takes labor, often highly paid.Apple's $2.1 million per employee doesn't really compare, given its large contract-manufacturing workforce. Meanwhile, an average Microsoft (MSFT) employee generates a more moderate $800,000 in revenue.Outside the tech sector, revenue per employee is lower still. General Electric (GE) is at $350,000 and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at $550,000. General Motors is at $700,000, excluding its network of independent dealers.IBD'S TAKE: High revenue per worker generally translates into high profit margins. Look for companies whose margins are high relative to its competitors and either steady or growing. For a primer, read this Investor's Corner. IBD makes research easier with a proprietary SMR Rating that combines sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how your stocks rate.As for tech employment overall, the sector took 15 years to finally top its 2000 dot-com peak of 6.6 million jobs. After adding nearly 200,000 jobs in 2015, it now employs 6.7 million people, the Computing Technology Industry Association said earlier this year.The reason it took so long was the big shift in tech manufacturing out of the U.S., as the dot-com bust and China's emergence led to a wave of outsourcing. From the end of 2000 through 2015, the U.S. tech industry shed more than 800,000 factory jobs, or 44%. More than a half million of those jobs were gone by the end of 2003.In this context of slow economic growth, weak wage gains and anger over the lost factory jobs, Donald Trump has made it a campaign speech staple to pledge that if he's elected, Apple will make its iPhones in the U.S., not in China.The logistics of shifting production from China, where some 250,000 Foxconn workers assemble the iPhone, are daunting and would entail intensive training of U.S. workers. If it were feasible, it would substantially raise the cost of an iPhone — even if the U.S. workers made little more than the minimum wage.Instead of a tech job boom, jobs in health care, social assistance, leisure, hospitality, retail and government account for 99.5% of all net employment gains dating back to the end of 2000, Labor Department data show. Since mid-2007, those sectors minus government account for about 94% of net new nonfarm jobs.That helps explain why productivity gains have been so weak since the recession, says Lakshman Achuthan of the Economic Cycle Research Institute.""Economic growth, such as it is, has been skewed toward growth in the number of hours worked, largely in lower-wage service sector jobs, while capital investment has taken a huge hit"" in the aftermath of the Great Recession, Achuthan wrote.While companies outside the tech sector have bolstered tech employment internally, the surprising truth is that the latest wave of innovation has benefited relatively few workers directly, and the economywide impact also has been limited. Those facts help explain weak economic growth, weak wage growth and the rise of political populism.If productivity, a measure of output per worker hour, had continued to grow at its pre-2004 rate, the economy would be about 15% bigger, calculates University of Chicago economics professor Chad Syverson. That's another $2.7 trillion, or $21,900 per household. If that had been the case, one can imagine that the 2016 election cycle would sound a whole lot less angry.Instead, productivity growth has crawled at an average 0.5% a year over the past half-decade, Labor Department data show. That compares to 2.4% annual gains over the prior two decades.Even when you strip out the productivity drag from falling capital intensity, which is the amount of capital per worker, the modest lift from the tech sector is clear.Multifactor productivity is the component of productivity growth that serves as ""a measure of innovation's contribution to growth"" because it reflects efficiency gains that aren't directly explained by the capital and labor inputs, explains economist Robert Gordon, a professor at Northwestern University.The digital revolution did help produce a decade of rapid multifactor productivity growth from 1995 to 2004 — an average of 1.4% a year. But ""the acceleration died out quickly because most of the economy had already benefited from the Internet revolution,"" Gordon argues in ""The Rise and Fall of American Growth.""Despite the rise of cloud computing, the app economy and social media over the past decade, multifactor productivity growth slowed to 0.4% a year.As George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen writes, ""While information technology remains the most likely source of future breakthroughs, Silicon Valley has not saved us just yet.""But technology has given entrepreneurs a low-cost platform for innovation. That lets relatively few people do big things. It also helps individuals to connect with people who want what they have to offer — from a spare room (Airbnb) to their back seat (Uber) to a handyman (TaskRabbit).In fact, the augmented reality technology behind Pokemon Go that lets players see Pikachu in their offline environment, is viewed as one likely source of future productivity gains.""AR, despite the Pokemon Go hype, is actually primarily a business tool application that facilitates increased productivity among work groups,"" writes Tim Mulligan of Midia Research.An internal study by Boeing (BA) found that trainees assembling a wing were 30% faster and 90% more accurate on their initial attempt thanks to getting their instructions via augmented reality instead of a desktop computer.Productivity growth was sluggish in the decade after Steve Jobs introduced the Mac. But one innovation built upon another and gave way to the internet era, so it's too early to rule out another productivity boom.

1169,GPS,"Express (EXPR) continued its 2016 slide as its earnings missed and its outlook was weak, driving shares down 25.5% Wednesday. That followed generally well-received results from young adult apparel retailers such as Urban Outfitters (URBN).Express, which targets men and women aged 20-30 at its more than 600 stores, said second-quarter earnings per share minus one-time items plunged 48% to 13 cents on a 5.8% drop in sales to $504.77 million. Analysts expected 17 cents diluted EPS and $520.95 million sales.It was the second quarter in a row that Express' earnings fell short.President and CEO David Kornberg said in a statement that foot traffic at Express mall stores was disappointing and that ""this was compounded by a lack of clarity across the assortment."" Kornberg said he believed the company's fall assortment ""is more cohesive across our wearing occasions.""Still, Express expects Q3 diluted EPS of 9-15 cents, while Wall Street had forecast 32 cents. The company's earnings will be impacted by $105 million-$110 million in capital expenditures this year as it reorganizes and rolls out new lines to boost sales.For the full year, Express guided for adjusted EPS of $1-$1.14, well below consensus for $1.46.Express shares closed at 11.94 in the stock market today, after falling intraday to their lowest levels since May 2014.IBD'S TAKE: Although specialty retailers such as Express are struggling amid intense competition from Amazon.com and an overbuilt sector, there are exceptions.

The new iPhones and Apple Watches are seen as incremental upgrades to the current-generation products.When it came to Thursday trading, Apple stock sank 2.6% to 105.51 on the stock market today, hitting a 1-month low.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has a below-average IBD Composite Rating of 37, meaning it has been outperformed by 63% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

He rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 116.Apple's new products also are ""good enough"" for the company to maintain its innovation leadership, William Blair analyst Anil Doradla said in a report.""Although there were no materially surprising announcements made, we believe that these new releases represent necessary steps to move the Apple story forward,"" Doradla said. ""Apple's incremental innovations for the iPhone are focused on improving the processing power of the device, lengthening the battery life, and delivering improvements in voice and video.""The prices for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (starting at $649 and $769, respectively) show that Apple hopes to maintain its premium status and high gross margins, Doradla said.

His previous valuation range was 115 to 125.Um sees limited upside potential for the stock in the near term.With the iPhone 7 unveiling in the rearview mirror, attention will shift to consumer demand and such risks as global economic uncertainties and exposure to the China market, he said.The iPhone 7 is the first waterproof iPhone. Technically it is ""water resistant,"" with a rating of IP67 under International Electrotechnical Commission standards. The standard means that the iPhone 7 can survive being submerged in water up to 1-meter deep for 30 minutes.By comparison, the new Apple Watch Series 2 is water resistant to a depth of 50 meters, so it can be used while swimming, surfing or playing in the pool.The iPhone 7 also has advanced cameras, increased battery life, a faster processor, more data storage, better display and stereo speakers. The high-end iPhone 7 Plus has a dual-camera system offering digital SLR quality photos with improved zoom capabilities.Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said the iPhone 7 ""will be compelling enough to encourage enough consumers to upgrade to return the company to growth.""Apple has had two straight quarters of declining iPhone sales on a year-over-year basis.Munster rates Apple stock as overweight with a price target of 151.The camera improvements are the most significant feature of the iPhone 7 series, IHS Technology analyst Ian Fogg said in a note.""In a maturing smartphone market, a new camera helps persuade consumers their current smartphone is no longer good enough,"" Fogg said. ""We expect the iPhone 7 camera to successfully differentiate it from other smartphones.""The camera is one of the few smartphone features with vast room for improvement.""Apple lowered the price of its original Apple Watch, renamed Series 1, to $269 from $299. Apple Watch Series 1 also will get a faster processor.The Apple Watch Series 2, which starts at $369, is more focused on fitness and health applications. It has a built-in GPS, better waterproofing, a faster processor and brighter display.Apple has changed its sales pitch on the Apple Watch, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said in a report.""The focus is overwhelmingly on fitness,"" he said. ""Although we believe Apple Watch still has potential in (Internet of Things) applications, its sport-oriented upgrades may lead consumers and investors to view it more as a smarter replacement for a GPS running watch than a general-purpose watch doubling as smartphone companion.""Uerkwitz is neutral on Apple stock, rating it as perform.Many consumers likely were waiting for a second-generation Apple Watch before buying the device, so there could be pent-up demand, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a report.White has a buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 185.RELATED:Apple Introduces Waterproof iPhone 7 HandsetApple Debuts Fitness-Centric Apple Watch Series 2 With 'Pokemon Go'

1227,GPS,"Apple (AAPL) is set to unveil its 10th-generation smartphone, the iPhone 7, on Wednesday, but many of its features are believed to have leaked to the tech media in recent weeks. That sets the stage for another surprise-free product launch event for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company.Analysts expect the iPhone 7 to be waterproof for the first time and to be slightly thinner than the current iPhone 6S series handsets. It is seen having a redesigned home button and no analog headphone jack. Plus, it will come in new colors — possibly dark blue and two shades of black. The iPhone 7 also will have a faster processor, more data storage and better cameras. The larger iPhone 7 Plus is seen sporting a dual-camera system.Expectations are low for Wednesday's event because the iPhone 7 is seen as a minor upgrade to the iPhone 6S.""The truly exciting stuff comes next year,"" Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a report Monday.

1239,GPS,"It's the science-fiction nightmare we've all dreaded -- perhaps the rogue computer from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" somehow joins forces with the brutal robots from one of ""The Terminator"" movies to seize your job.In more realistic terms, you might fear your company's bean counters finding any excuse they can to automate you out of employment. Maybe these manic cost cutters end up cooking a gourmet recipe for a robot economy -- that seemingly inevitable era where inefficient humans are rendered useless by hyper-efficient cyborgs.Well, something resembling that day may already be here. But it's not as dreary as you or Hollywood has envisioned. At least not yet.Robotic and artificial intelligence systems being developed by IBM (IBM), Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Tesla Motors (TSLA) and others are sophisticated and cheap enough to spread rapidly through the economy. As a result, more systems will be put to work, drastically altering the job landscape.""Virtually every industry in existence is likely to become less labor-intensive in future years as new technology is assimilated into existing business models,"" wrote Janus Capital Group lead portfolio manager Bill Gross in a May 4 Investment Outlook report. He added: ""Millions of jobs will be lost over the next 10-15 years.""Routine tasks such as data entry and research could be increasingly automated. But they're the tip of the iceberg, and some professions that could be hit might surprise you.Among the vulnerable: truck drivers, attorneys, nurses and even nuclear technicians.IBD'S TAKE: Artificial intelligence seems like a smart bet for many companies. Alphabet and Facebook are in buy range. Nvidia, whose chips are being used in many AI systems, soared to a fresh high Friday after reporting another quarter of blowout earnings. ""Medicine, manufacturing and even service-intensive jobs are at risk,"" said Gross. ""Investment managers too! Not only blue-collar but now white-collar professionals are being threatened by technological change.""Oxford University researchers studied the future of employment and how susceptible jobs are to computerization. They concluded that a staggering number of jobs are at risk.""According to our estimates, about 47% of total U.S. employment is at risk,"" the researchers said.Others see no need for knee-jerk paranoia.""While automation will eliminate very few occupations entirely in the next decade, it will affect portions of almost all jobs to a greater or lesser degree,"" according to a McKinsey report released in July.At-risk doesn't necessarily mean gone. New technologies generally improve productivity, creating higher-value, higher-wage jobs, experts say. They also create fields of work that didn't even exist before.By one popular estimate, 65% of children entering primary school today will end up working in jobs that don't exist now, according to the World Economic Forum.Still, the number of jobs in certain fields will likely dwindle in coming years, affecting many people in the workforce. A Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) report last December projected overall U.S. employment will grow about 6.5% from 2014 to 2024. That compares to labor force growth of 5.1%.Here are some middle-class jobs that will be affected by automation in that time frame. Some will grow despite the incursion of automation, some will decline and others will expand at a slower than average rate.Truck drivers are one of the most endangered blue-collar jobs. In May 2015, autonomous trucks began rolling down U.S. highways for the first time after Nevada licensed a new Daimler (DDAIF) Freightliner 18-wheeler called Inspiration. For now, a human has to be in the cab during the prototype phase.Tesla Motors is working on plans for self-driving, all-electric heavy trucks, CEO Elon Musk wrote in his recent ""Master Plan.""Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford says all leading trucking companies are experimenting with autonomous truck technology.""UPS would be the most logical. I know they have looked at the possibility,"" Hartford told IBD.UPS already employs driver-assistance systems on many trucks, but says full autonomy is further off, with regulation being a key issue.Truck drivers are in short supply now, and self-driving trucks would fill that gap. But if large numbers of self-driving trucks roll out -- with no human in the cab -- Teamsters and other unions would likely resist.""That will be a potential issue,"" Hartford said.Overall, jobs for truck drivers are projected to grow at a slower-than-average 4% rate through 2024. And for light-truck delivery services such as UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX), jobs will grow at just a 3% clip.Modest employment gains could look great next to the longer-therm outlook. Trucks are expected to lead the push for autonomous vehicles on American roads, which could drastically shrink employment among the estimated 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the U.S., starting in the 2020s.""Improved routing through GPS technology can make existing light-truck drivers more productive, which may limit the demand for additional drivers,"" the BLS said.Ross is an artificial intelligence system that does legal research using IBM's Watson supercomputer. It searches through mountains of case files for data points that attorneys can use in court. IBM says Watson can read 40 million documents in 15 seconds, replacing some entry-level attorneys.The system's inventor, Ross Intelligence, rolled it out in early 2016. It's at work in a few law firms today, including BakerHostetler, which employs more than 900 attorneys across the nation. Users ask spoken questions and Ross reads through ""the entire body of law"" and returns a cited answer and topical readings from legislation, according to the startup's co-founder and Chief Executive Andrew Arruda.Machine learning, which gives computers the ability to learn rather than having to be programmed, will make robo-attorneys even more useful.""Artificial intelligence is going to be included in all software,"" Arruda told IBD. ""It will learn and get better and do a lot more with less as we move away from programming systems to teaching them.""As Ross handles more of the grunt work, it will free experienced attorneys to tackle more cases and do more in-depth research. The BLS estimates that the number of jobs for lawyers will grow 6% by 2024, a bit lower than average. But if more law firms employ AI systems like Ross, that could grow at a slower rate.Alphabet's Google recently said its Deep Mind technology research unit is harnessing artificial intelligence in its work with Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. The goal is to develop treatments for ailments such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness among the elderly.""By allowing earlier detection and treatment of AMD,"" Google says on its website, ""machine learning has the potential to help save the sight of many of these people.""Rising numbers of aging baby boomers requiring more health care, however, will offset productivity gains from AI and robotics. BLS projects the number of jobs for licensed vocational nurses and registered nurses will grow 16% by 2024.Underwriters evaluate the risks of insuring specific potential clients to determine how much coverage to provide and the right premium to charge. Automated underwriting software is enabling underwriters to process applications faster.""As the technology improves, more underwriting decisions can be made automatically,"" the BLS says. As a result, 11% fewer underwriters will be needed by the mid-2020s.Employment of surveying and mapping technicians is projected to fall 8% by 2024.""Advancements in surveying technology, such as robotic total stations, let surveyors complete more work in less time, reducing the demand for surveyors,"" the BLS said. Still, some surveyors will be needed for tasks that haven't been automated yet, such as certifying boundary lines and reviewing sites for construction.By studying the Earth and its land features, geographers create and modify maps and analyze geographic data to create reports. They use tools such as satellite-based global positioning systems.More than half of all geographers work for the federal government. Advances in computer technology that create a faster, more efficient work process, combined with government budget cuts, are expected to reduce employment by 2%.Public safety communications operators help keep communities safe. But jobs are projected to fall 3% by 2024.""Consolidation of emergency communication centers, enabled by advances in technology, is expected to reduce the employment of dispatchers,"" the BLS said. ""Still, job prospects should be good because the stressful nature of the jobs results in many workers leaving the occupation,"" and this turnover opens up positions.When ATMs came into wide use in the 1970s, some observers predicted the number of bank tellers would fall. That didn't happen.""Job growth for tellers was driven by the expansion of bank branches, where most tellers work,"" the BLS said.But as online and mobile banking have grown more common, the number of branches has shrunk. According to market tracker SNL Financial, U.S. banks finished 2015 with 92,997 branches, 1,614 fewer than a year earlier.""It extended a continuous branch reduction trend that dates back to 2009,"" SNL said in a Jan. 12 report. The BLS forecasts the number of teller jobs will fall 8% by 2024 to 480,500.According to the Nuclear Power Institute, nuclear power accounts for 19% of the electricity generated in the U.S. today. Nuclear power plants have gained greater acceptance in recent years and are seen by some as a cheap, clean energy source. They face tough competition, however, from lower-maintenance renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, both of which are gaining popularity. Some technicians will be needed to maintain and upgrade existing nuclear plants, but employment of nuclear technicians is expected to fall 5%.Drafters use software to convert designs of architects and engineers into schematics and technical drawings. The BLS says computer-aided design and other automation tools ""allow engineers and architects to perform many tasks that used to be done by drafters."" As a result, employment is forecast to fall 3%.---Despite job losses in these fields and others due to advances in artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, the economy should benefit overall from productivity gains and creation of new jobs, according to Matt Anchin, who heads communications and content development as senior vice president for Monster Worldwide's (MWW) Monster.com job site, which lists roughly 5 million jobs.The jobs market continues to evolve rapidly, Anchin said, and he's optimistic about the overall outlook""Mobile technology is creating nothing but opportunity,"" he told IBD. ""We see it as a ripple effect.""Think of transportation, Uber and Lyft, part of the sharing economy,"" he said. ""Humans are remarkably good at adapting as new technologies emerge.""

1240,GPS,"The recent murders of two female joggers in separate incidents on the East Coast show the need for mobile technology that can quickly contact police in an emergency.An upcoming feature for Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch could be a lifesaver.The SOS feature in the watchOS 3 software update, due out this fall, acts as a panic button for people to call 911 from their Apple Watch.To activate SOS and call 911 for help, you only need to press and hold the side button on the Apple Watch for about three seconds.The feature works wirelessly with a user's iPhone to automatically initiate a call with local emergency services. Many joggers strap their iPhone to their arm and play music while they're running.The unsolved murders this month of Karina Vetrano in Queens, N.Y., and Vanessa Marcotte in Princeton, Mass., have served as a wake-up call to women who jog alone. In the wake of their deaths, many fitness enthusiasts likely would be receptive to any technology that could keep them safer.Apple says the feature will work in all countries where the watch is sold. The feature sends your current location to emergency officials.Shares closed down less than 0.1% at 107.93.IBD'S TAKE: With iPhone sales declining, Apple needs new products like the Apple Watch to drive growth. The N in IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System stands for ""new,"" such as new products, services or management that can help drive profits and share prices higher.Apple also has included the ability to cancel the SOS call within 10 seconds in case the dialing happened accidentally.The SOS feature also can be used for medical emergencies. It can be programmed to share a basic medical ID, giving emergency services your name, age, and listing any medical conditions. It also will automatically message the friends and family you have assigned as contacts.Apple introduced the SOS feature in its keynote presentation at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on June 13.""We're finding that people who are wearing Apple Watch wear it all the time and this opens up some new, great ways that we can help,"" Kevin Lynch, vice president of technology at Apple, said at WWDC. ""One of these is actually getting help in critical situations, just by pushing a button that's actually on you. So you might be having a medical emergency or a safety situation (and can use SOS).""It's a feature that people will rarely, if ever, need, but it's great to have, he said.RELATED:Next Apple Watch To Include GPS, But No Cellular Capability: AnalystFossil Targets Apple Watch With New Smartwatch Lineup

1241,GPS,"Apple (AAPL) leads the nascent smartwatch business with its Apple Watch, but traditional watch maker Fossil Group (FOSL) isn't about to cede the market to consumer electronics giant.Fossil on Tuesday announced that its latest display smartwatches, the Q Wander and Q Marshal, will go on sale in Fossil stores and online on Aug. 29, with pre-orders beginning this Friday. Both models run the Android Wear operating system from Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google. They start at $295, which is roughly the same as an entry-level Apple Watch, which retails starting at $299.IBD'S TAKE: Fossil risks becoming a fossil if it can't adapt to the shift to digital devices. Its sales have fallen for five consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. Fossil stock has a bottom-of-the-barrel IBD Composite Rating of 1, meaning it has been outperformed by 99% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For a list of top-performing stocks, check out the IBD 50.""Fossil is known for its quality timepieces, and we're proud of the seamless expansion to our wearables collection,"" Fossil Chief Creative Officer Jill Elliott said in a statement. ""These slim yet highly functional smartwatches reflect the elevated design of a Fossil watch, while incorporating a digital experience that's important to today's customer.""Like the Apple Watch, the new Fossil smartwatches connect wirelessly to a smartphone and display notifications -- such as texts, calls and app updates -- on your wrist. The device vibrates when it receives a notification. Also like the Apple Watch, the Fossil smartwatches track activity such as steps taken, distance traveled and calories burned.The Fossil smartwatches are compatible with both Apple iPhones and Google Android-based smartphones.The Fossil Q lineup of digital devices now has more than 20 products, including activity trackers that compete with fitness bands from Fitbit (FIT) and others.Meanwhile, Apple is expected to launch a second-generation Apple Watch this fall, along with an upgraded version of the original Apple Watch. The Apple Watch 2 likely will include a GPS radio and barometer for better geolocation capabilities, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a research report.Fossil stock fell 1.2% to 30.36 on the stock market today. Apple stock rose 0.4% to 108.81.RELATED:Apple Watch Shipments Dive 55% As Device Passes 1-Year Anniversary.

1242,GPS,"LAS VEGAS -- The speed limit of a Terminator is 25 miles per hour, quipped Jeff Melrose, principal technology strategist for Yokogawa US, on Wednesday. And the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration just ruled it illegal to shoot down a drone.But that's not what Melrose finds most disconcerting about the rapid acceleration (both literal and figurative) of drone technology. DJI's Phantom 4 Drone, a newbie to the market, has a three-mile range, 24-minute-plus flight time and can travel 45 mph.It can also track people.""No one expects the e-chainsaw,"" Melrose told a several-hundred-thick crowd at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. ""Drones allow (digital) attacks at a long distance, and drones can tailgate workers as easily as people.""Electronic warfare may come across as a trope out of Arnold Schwarzenegger's most famous series, but it's rooted in reality, Melrose said. And corporate espionage is just as much a certainty as that of nation-state actors.New Jersey truck driver Gary Bojczak was neither, but in 2013 he found himself in hot water after buying a jammer to thwart his company's GPS tracking efforts.The jammer worked too well. Bojczak's work took him near Newark Liberty Airport where his jammer -- a sub-$100 device -- shuttered a GPS-based guidance system. Federal authorities fined him $32,000 after tracing the signal to his truck.Drones compound the problem, Melrose says. Operating on the inverse square law, the closer a transmitter gets to a network, the stronger it becomes. Drones carrying transmitters can get really close ... and fences mean absolutely nothing when your weapon flies.A drone like DJI's newest iteration tracks moving objects autonomously and is capable of bringing a transmitter close enough to cause interference. Jammers are illegal, Melrose noted. But corporate spying and sabotage is nothing new.Industrial-tied businesses should secure overhead access and be aware of gaps in the wireless spectrum that roving electronic warmongers might skip. Interference isn't the only attack vector. A drone can steal visible information or perch for long-term surveillance.""You might only have 25 minutes of flying time, but once it's sitting there, it can virtually record forever,"" he said. ""You have to start telling your physical security guys to check in odd places. You might find drones hanging out in strange places.""Last month at the Warsaw Summit, the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) officially recognized cyberspace as a military domain. That's important in Ukraine, where Russian forces have occupied portions of the country since 2014.That's also important more broadly where peacetime countries now face many decisions regarding peacetime hacking and the extent of allowable surveillance, says Kenneth Geers, a senior research scientist for security firm Comodo, who is based in Ukraine.""What can you do in peacetime? How do the laws of war apply in cyberspace?"" he asked. ""We have to get busy in peacetime if you want to be successful in wartime. That means you need a clearly stated policy of deterrence and the ability to enforce policy against your adversary.""Although Ukraine isn't a NATO member, it's likely some of those parallels will play out there. Over the past two years, the death toll in Ukraine has rocketed into the thousands. Now, armed with ""weapons of mass disruption,"" both sides are entering the digital realm.In 2014, a virus crippled Ukraine's Central Election Commission system ahead of the presidential election, and last December, hackers cut power to more than 230,000 people. Both countries have hacked smart billboards to display their own messaging.Closer to home, the Democratic National Committee discovered in June that it had been hacked by two cyber-espionage groups with alleged ties to Russian military intelligence. One had been in the system for years, according to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. The other, for months.The key takeaway, says Geers, is that cyber warfare exists. And the digital front could soon intensify ground strikes, he said.""Hackers could turn out the lights for a while and confuse leadership,"" he said. ""Or the enemy has a zero day for an application on which you are dependent. Then, it might be a very long day on the battlefield.""It's not necessarily that Apple's (AAPL) iPhones are more secure than their Android counterparts, say Atredis Partners founders Shawn Moyer and Josh Thomas. The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant is simply better than Android at deploying updates.That's because Android is vastly more fragmented than Apple, running several operating systems vs. Apple's singular iOS.But those updates can only go so far if the hardware is infected, Moyer and Thomas said. From an internal perspective, Apple and Android aren't dramatically different. Chipmakers like Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) supply the lot.And the vast majority -- Windows and BlackBerry (BBRY) included -- share hardware-based security measures like TrustZone and Boot Loader, both of which are handled on the processor. So a bug impacting Qualcomm's system-on-a-chip could, theoretically, disrupt 60% of the phones on the market today.Exploits gouging TrustZone and Boot Loader circumvent mobile-device management, which pushes out software updates but can do little for a hardware-based bug, Moyer said. As the Bring Your Own Device trend burgeons, he suggested enterprises only support devices running the newest operating system.Therein lies Apple's dominance. For years, Android only pushed patches every six months. But that's too infrequent in today's attack landscape, they said. Apple users are better trained to accept updates transmitted digitally, leaving the fragmented Android market twirling in the wind.Android users aren't acquiescing to vendors' hopes that they'll upgrade their smartphones every two years. Go to a cafe in Nairobi, Moyer says, ""You're going to see people using handsets you haven't seen for years."" That's unfortunate because Android often stops supporting older devices.""Almost every Apple device that's deployed is on the newest version or one version back,"" he said. ""People are saying Apple is winning security. This is one reason why. They're not necessarily better at security, they're just better at pushing upgrades.""

1243,GPS,"The second Prime Day was the biggest day ever for Amazon.com (AMZN), with orders surpassing last year's tally by more than 60% worldwide and 50% in the U.S., the e-commerce leader said Wednesday.Amazon did not release sales figures for Prime Day, but last year's 24-hour sales event notched sales of $375 million to $400 million, analyst estimated. Analyst had forecast this year's revenue from Prime Day to be about double last year's.Prime Day was ""another record-breaking success for the sellers and small businesses worldwide,"" Amazon said in its press release. It said small businesses and sellers on Amazon offering deals to Prime members saw orders nearly triple from last year's Prime Day, both worldwide and in the U.S.Amazon launched Prime Day last year, saying it was a celebration of its 20th anniversary. It was also an opportunity to sign up more Prime members, who pay $99 a year and get free two-day shipping on most goods in addition to access to streaming video, music and other perks.Like last year, many analysts said Prime Day lacked a lot of compelling deals. Deals were plentiful, but consumers complained that most of the bargains were on leftover inventory rather than must-have shopping items, wrote Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos in a research note.""Despite the catchy name, we believe the company's efforts center primarily around reducing excess inventory, while also highlighting the meaningful value proposition for Prime subscribers,"" he wrote.The day started with a glitch that prevented some buyers of being able to get to the checkout line, a problem that was fixed a few hours later. But the day was just as much about signing up new members for the Amazon Prime loyalty service as it was about sales.Kurnos estimates Amazon signed 6 million new Prime members this year, up from 4 million last year. He estimates Amazon ended Q2 with 85 million Prime members globally and says Amazon could end the year with 110 million Prime members, 75 million in the U.S. and 35 million international. That's significant in that Prime members reportedly spend substantially more with Amazon than do non-Prime members.Kurnos increased its price target on Amazon stock to 915 from 750, with a buy rating.Amazon stock fell 0.8% to 742.63 in the stock market today, still near this week's record highs. It has been an IBD Leaderboard stock for awhile and carries a strong IBD Composite Rating of 97, putting it among the top 3% of stocks in key metrics such as revenue growth.Several retailers jumped aboard the success of Prime Day, taking advantage of the media buzz leading up to the event. Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Gap (GPS) this week were promoting big discounts and free shipping.On Monday, Wal-Mart began offering free shipping with no minimum purchase for five days to counter the rival Amazon event. Late last month, Wal-Mart began offering a free 30-day trial of its ShippingPass, which gives customers unlimited two-day shipping on product orders for $49 a year.Gap, which is the parent company of Banana Republic and Old Navy, tried to avoid the appearance of piggybacking on Amazon, as did Target.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.5% on Wednesday. Gap dipped 0.4% and Target 0.5%.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Edward Yruma, in a research note, said Amazon's successful Prime Day event continues to reinforce Amazon as a shopping destination for consumers and a key partner for vendors. Yruma has an overweight rating on Amazon stock, and price target of 820.

1244,GPS,"Similar to those shopping in malls during the holiday season, customers of Amazon.com (AMZN) complained about waiting in the checkout line for Amazon Prime Day.Amazon later said it fixed the problem, but ChannelAdvisor (ECOM), a company that helps merchants sell items on Amazon.com and other sites, found that its third-party sellers' sales this Prime Day were only about the same as the previous Prime Day, Bloomberg reported.Amazon Prime Day was the busiest shopping day of the year for the e-commerce giant in 2015, the first year for the special promotion. On Tuesday, as was the case last year, Amazon was loaded with discounts on all manner of products for its second Prime Day, attracting so many shoppers that even Amazon's vaunted infrastructure apparently wasn't up to the task.Wrote one Amazon customers on Twitter: ""Fail. Add to cart failed. Retrying … on everything."" Others chimed in with similar complaints, to which Amazon replied: ""Some customers are reporting difficulty with checkout. We're working to resolve this issue quickly.""The one-day sales event, which ends at midnight Pacific Time, is exclusively for members of the company's Amazon Prime loyalty program. Amazon reported that ""several hundred thousand"" consumers signed up for Amazon Prime last year on Prime Day, a scenario likely to be repeated.Amazon said its first Prime Day last year was a celebration of its 20th anniversary. It sold its most units ever, more than even its biggest Black Friday shopping event, Amazon said. Customers ordered 34.4 million items, an average of 398 items per second.""Members will find twice as many Prime Day deals this year, with more than 30% of Lightning Deals worldwide from small businesses and sellers,"" Amazon said in a press release.

If these discounts are indicative of what's to come, we think consumers will be pleased with Prime Day sales,"" he wrote.Amazon stock briefly hit a record high for a fifth straight session, edging up to 757.34. But shares closed at 748.21, down a fraction in the stock market today.

1247,GPS,"Pessimism about the U.S. economy has fallen to its lowest level since last November, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a bad sign for consumer spending as Apple (AAPL), Gap (GPS) and other consumer companies report sluggish demand.The sentiment gauge fell 2.7 points, or 5.6%, to 45.5, matching November's reading. The index has been below the neutral 50 level since April 2015.The poll's Six-Month Economic Outlook, a measure of how consumers feel about the economy's prospects in the next six months, dropped 6.9 points to 36.7, falling 15.8%. That's the lowest since a matching reading last September. Since July 2008, the economic outlook measure has only been lower twice -- during the 2011 debt ceiling standoff and the 2013 partial government shutdown.The weak overall and outlook readings are a bad sign for consumer spending. Apple iPhone sales already are weak, while apparel and department stores such as Gap and Macy's (M) have reported declining revenue and store closures. Auto sales have held up at a high level, but General Motors (GM) and most other rivals missed June sales estimates.The poll of 905 Americans was conducted June 24-29, as global financial markets initially were roiled due to the U.K. vote to exit the European Union. That likely was a factor, particularly among self-described investors. The Economic Optimism Index tumbled 8.3% to 44.8 among investors, but it dipped just 1.9% to 46.5 among non-investors. Investors' six-month outlook plunged 20.4% to 35.2, while non-investors' outlook skidded a still-hefty 10.3% to to 38.2.""Americans' view of the U.S. economic outlook became gloomier this month because of concerns about global economy uncertainties triggered by Brexit,"" said Raghavan Mayur, president of TechnoMetrica, IBD's polling partner. ""Further, the U.S. stock market corrected.""Stock markets have bounced back in recent days.

""Fifty percent think the economy is not improving, while 45% think it is. While 55% say that we are not in a recession, 38% believe we are in one.""The U.S. economy added just 38,000 jobs in May after April's sluggish 123,000, according to Labor Department data.

So you came away pretty much frustrated in that exercise, feeling that nobody can call the market.""That attitude turned 180 degrees when a friend showed Hicks a copy of IBD in the 1980s. The newspaper was launched as a daily in April 1984.""I was absolutely amazed that I almost had to sit in a chair,"" he said. ""This was what I was looking for all my life.""Hicks savored the screens of stocks that showed a rare combination of traits: strong volume demand and stellar fundamentals.""It was like heaven,"" he said. ""Now I could rely on the financial statement information, but I had the timing of how to read the chart and the backdrop of the all-important market status. So when you stack these advantages into your probability (of finding a winner), you start having markedly better success on a more consistent basis.""The ""Ask Bill"" series -- a former Investors.com feature that gave concise answers to questions submitted by readers about the stock market -- also energized Hicks. He says he printed out nearly every answer and stored them in a file for frequent reference.Hicks is not only a longtime IBD reader, but also a host of the St. Petersburg/Clearwater, Fla., Meetup group, one of the best-attended IBD Meetups in the U.S. (To find a Meetup in your area, hover the mouse over ""How to Invest"" in the main navigation bar at Investors.com, then click on ""IBD Meetups."")At a past gathering, 53 people showed up, a monthly record and all the more impressive considering that snowbirds from the Northeast had already headed back up the coast.The group, started in October 2003, had a humble start. It had no whiteboard on which to diagram the winning patterns that great stocks form before breaking out. No computer. No internet connection either. They examined charts with transparencies, a grease pen and an overhead projector.Now, Hicks and fellow staffers charge $26 a ticket. In return, the attendee gets a two-entree dinner with salad, bread, coffee and dessert, a batch of charts and other information, and several hours of education and guidance from veteran IBD readers on how to follow the market, how to build a watch list and how to use charts.""The problem all the Meetups will face is the room charge. You can handle the meal costs, because you're giving people the value of the meal, although they do complain about the quality of the food regularly,"" Hicks said with a laugh.""But I always tell them, 'Look, we're getting the room for such a discount because we're buying the meal, just pretend the meal is free.' I've been acting as assistant chef and telling them what vegetables were good to prepare from (the) frozen (stage). My line to the catering manager is, 'Look, please do not give us rubber carrots.' ""By adding a small override to the attendance fee, Hicks was able to raise enough funds to buy a digital projector and whiteboard to enhance the learning experience. He also gives a welcome package with 64 pages of material -- mostly Investor's Corner articles -- to new members.""We had borrowed a number of techniques from the (Meetup) folks in Chicago,"" he said.Hicks says a turning point in his investing life came in 2003. In the years preceding that, an 80-hour workweek and a string of personal tragedies made it hard for him to concentrate on the stock market.""In May 2003, I knew that IBD is a golden goose, so I decided that either I had to study it, like a CPA, or I had to discredit it and become a mutual fund investor,"" he said.After the grueling tax-return season, he spent a weekend that month going through the educational features on Investors.com.That's when he discovered ""Ask Bill."" He learned so much from each nugget of information that he locked himself in his study from Friday night to Sunday night, asking his wife to leave meals outside the door. His computer printer ran all day, all night.""It was an epiphany. I didn't know how the printer did not burn out,"" he said.He caught the new roaring bull market by the tail.GPS device leader Garmin (GRMN) was his first CAN SLIM stock, which he bought right at the breakout from a proper cup with handle in December 2002, two months after the major indexes bottomed. Hicks sold the stock for a 66% gain in less than six months.He scored a bunch of winners that year, nailing down gains of 30% to 60% each.Then came his all-time portfolio champ, stun gun maker Taser International (TASR).IBD: You scored a 100% gain the first time you bought Taser in 2003. Why did you buy it again?Hicks: I was sorry I sold it the first time. I was looking at a proper new entry point, and I saw that narrow opportunity in mid-December (1). It did not quite meet all the criteria, but you could just kind of tell (it was setting up for a new breakout). The way it acted reminded me of the Nicolas Darvas book, ""How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market."" You could almost see that stock crouching like a dancer crouching before he jumped.When I saw that settle down over the holiday season in December, I took a pretty significant position, and then I pyramided that position up in January. Then I just sat tight.I could not believe my eyes as the tens of thousands (of profits in dollars) rolled up. All my friends, of course, and my family, and wife said to me, 'Are you going to hold it until you lose it all?' It just kept going up and up, and I kept sitting with my lips pursed.It was just so strong, and the story was so profound; that weapon was saving lives.But by April of 2004, the day I sold was a Monday. Obviously I knew the quarterly earnings would be released at 4:05 p.m. (Eastern time) that day. It had all the signs of a climax top. I said to myself, the expectations on this stock have to be so incredibly high at this point, I don't think even Taser could meet them. So I picked up the phone, called my broker and told her to sell everything. It is the first, and probably last, time that I sold a stock right at the top."" (Hicks achieved a 285% gain on the position.)IBD: Which features in IBD do you discuss regularly at the Meetup?Hicks: What I use for the printouts every month for the Meetup is The Big Picture. It does a number of things, especially for new people, but I also use it personally to interpret the market for me, even after all these years.Not only does it explain the market, but it gives you every day a list of the leading stocks that were up or down in big volume. So you can use that every day to identify those quality stocks according to CAN SLIM principles. And the text usually discusses some of those stocks.I think a lot of people do not recognize the immense value of what they're looking at on that page. I'm not aware of any other publication that puts on the front page a market call every day and tells you to the exact day that a new rally starts. And they call the exact day that they think it stops. I think that's an incredible thing to put on the front page of a major financial publication.IBD: Do you encounter some attendees who mix the rules of CAN SLIM with other systems or their own?Hicks: Yes, we've had quite a few, actually. I try not to give my opinion but Bill O'Neil's opinion, and what he advocates in all his materials. Bill has studied all these methodologies as well as charting methodologies like candlesticks, for example ... and he's not apologetic to say matter-of-factly that he's looked at these and invalidated them, and that none of these are superior to a simple price and volume chart.(Editor's Note: This interview originally published in the June 3, 2011, edition of IBD.)
"
1251,GPS,"Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday signed into law a measure to lift the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020, joining California, Seattle and New York City in embracing the labor movement's demand.Business groups warned, to no avail, that the higher minimum wage -- up from $10.50 today and $8.50 in June 2014 -- would hurt city businesses and ultimately reduce employment opportunities. Tipped workers would get $5 an hour -- but only if their tips add up to at least $10. Yet, if businesses are alarmed by the mandatory wage hike, their hair is on fire over the worker-scheduling bill that passed committee last week and comes before the City Council as soon as Tuesday.Back in January, Wal-Mart (WMT) pulled the plug on two stores planned for one of the district's lowest-income neighborhoods, which could have sorely used the jobs. At the time, Wal-Mart reportedly told city officials that the wage hikes already passed, the possibility of a $15 wage and the scheduling bill were to blame.The bill, modeled on San Francisco's ""Retail Workers ""Bill of Rights,' "" is intended to make D.C. one of the most labor-friendly cities in the nation, but opponents warn that it could backfire on the workers it is supposed to help.Even some advocates of a higher minimum wage are warning of negative fallout if the city adopts the scheduling legislation. The bill would require chains with at least 40 locations in the U.S. to post employee schedules two weeks in advance and provide ""predictability"" pay to workers who have their schedules changed. On top of that, the bill would require employers to offer part-time workers more hours before hiring additional employees.One prime target of the bill is just-in-time scheduling, a practice that offers employers the ability to adjust the amount of labor they use if, say, business is slow due to rainy weather. There is a legitimate complaint behind unpredictable work schedules because it limits the ability of workers to hold down a second job or attend to family needs.Retailers including Gap (GPS) and Urban Outfitters (URBN) have discontinued on-call scheduling, so the problem is perhaps being addressed due to negative publicity and political arm-twisting.Yet, the D.C. scheduling bill doesn't simply try to address this problem, but would penalize employers for attempting to fill a time slot when a worker gets sick or has some other emergency.Even more disruptive of current business practices would be the requirement to offer part-time workers more hours. The use of part-time work has been on the rise in modest-wage industries like retail, as employers facing higher minimum wages and a challenging earnings environment aim to limit what they spend on benefits.It's no coincidence that the number of workers regularly clocking just above 30 hours per week, relative to the number working just below 30 hours, has fallen to a record low. The ObamaCare employer-mandate 30-hour rule requires large employers to offer health coverage deemed ""affordable"" to workers once they cross that threshold.

1254,GPS,"Wearable fitness device maker Fitbit (FIT) has good momentum heading in the holiday shopping season, Morgan Stanley analyst Jerry Liu said in a research report Wednesday. Fitbit also should benefit from upcoming product refreshes, he said.Liu did not express the same confidence in fellow consumer electronics vendors Garmin (GRMN) and GoPro (GPRO).He rates Fitbit stock as overweight with a price target of 32, while rating Garmin as equal weight with a price target of 42, and GoPro as underweight with a price target of 9.Fitbit rose a fraction, to 12.23, on the stock market today. Garmin rose 2.4% to 42.41. GoPro ended the day unchanged at 10.81.""Fitbit is our top pick in consumer electronics, and we expect new products and accessories to help drive a strong holiday season,"" Liu said. ""Our distributor and reseller checks indicate demand is still strong, and Fitbit continues to dominate the competition.""Fitbit launched its Blaze smart fitness watch and Alta fitness band in March. Liu expects Fitbit to release new products in late Q3 or early Q4, possibly new versions of the Flex and Charge HR.Liu is not concerned about competition in wearables from Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch, the Apple Watch.""Both can succeed in wearables, as they only have some overlap in products, services and pricing,"" he said.Meanwhile, Garmin, which makes GPS navigation devices, sports watches and fitness trackers, is performing in line with expectations, Liu said.""Our checks suggest some of Garmin's fitness products are not resonating with mainstream consumers despite a new marketing campaign, while others are popular in the high end,"" Liu said. ""Outside of fitness, Garmin's outdoor and aviation businesses are delivering good growth and strong margins, and marine margins are improving.""GoPro, meanwhile, continues to struggle as action camera sales decline.""We are concerned GoPro's new Hero 5 camera this year will not have enough differentiation to drive a refresh cycle, and the Karma drone may be further delayed,"" Liu said.GoPro has done well with power users, such as extreme athletes, but hasn't broken through to mainstream consumers, Liu said. GoPro hopes to solve this problem by creating software that makes its videos easier to edit and share.RELATED:Apple Watch 2 Fitness Focus Pressuring Fitbit Stock.

Boeing edged up 0.8% and Lockheed added 0.4%.The meeting also comes as Musk's SpaceX takes on defense contracts, and as the Pentagon and Congress battle over the use of Russian-made engines in U.S. rocket launches.SpaceX was certified for military space launches last year, joining legacy provider United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture, as the only two companies approved for military payloads.Last month, the Pentagon awarded SpaceX a contact to send a GPS satellite into orbit, ending ULA's virtual monopoly on military space launches. ULA didn't bid on the contract due to SpaceX's cheaper pricing and issues with ULA's use of RD-180 Russian-built engines.Washington levied sanctions on Russia after it invaded Ukraine, putting restrictions on the number of engines ULA could use.But ULA and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin are working on building the BE-4 liquid rocket engine to replace the Russian one. The U.S.-built engine is expected to be ready for launch vehicles by 2019.Still, ULA and some lawmakers want restrictions eased on the Russian engines, warning they threaten U.S. space capabilities until the replacement is ready.Earlier this week, Sen. Bill Nelson, D- Fla., introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would allow the joint venture to have unlimited access to the RD-180 engines until the end of 2022.But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has long been critical of using Russian engines and wants the Air Force to prove that buying them doesn't violate U.S. sanctions.Meanwhile, Carter has been pushing for cooperation between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley and last year he became the first sitting defense chief in nearly two decades to visit the tech hub.The Pentagon also has a new Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental (DIUx) outreach office in Mountain View, Calif.So far, DIUx has been a flop. Only three out of 20 project were given contracts in eight months, according to Bloomberg. The Pentagon is notorious for being slow and risk averse, while Silicon Valley ventures are used to quickly getting funding after a successful product pitch.Tech companies are also especially hesitant about working with the Pentagon after Edward Snowden’s leaks over digital surveillance.Still, Carter believes in the outreach effort and made changes to try to speed up the process. Last month, he replaced the DIUx director and announced another office in Boston.

The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled.

Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss.

Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group.

1271,GPS,"Target (TGT) fell as much as 9.3% in early trading after first-quarter sales missed analysts’ estimates and the discount chain delivered a disappointing forecast, adding evidence that the biggest U.S. retailers are suffering from a slump.Target’s same-store sales gained 1.2% in the period, which ended April 30, the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had predicted 1.6% growth, according to Consensus Metrix.Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said the company faces “an increasingly volatile consumer environment,” adding his voice to the chorus of retailers complaining of sluggish demand. As it copes with the slowdown, the company expects same-store sales to range from flat to down as much as 2% in the second quarter. Earnings will be $1 to $1.20 a share, excluding some items. Analysts had estimated $1.36 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The results follow a string of weak earnings reports from some of the country’s largest retailers, including Macy’s (M) and Gap (GPS). Even Home Depot (HD), a bright spot in the retail industry, saw its shares sink this week over concerns about slowing growth. While the U.S. Commerce Department reported stronger retail sales for April, Americans appear to be shifting spending away from traditional retailers. Instead, more of them are putting their money toward online shopping or investing in homes, vehicles or technology.Still, Target has successfully used cost cuts to bolster profit. It reported earnings of $1.29 a share last quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.19.“We plan to successfully implement our long-term strategy, even in the face of a challenging short-term consumer landscape,” Cornell said in the statement.Prior to Target’s earnings release on Wednesday, analysts had been raising concerns that the retailer might not be able to keep up with Wall Street’s growth expectations. Analysts at Wolfe Research and Cleveland Research downgraded the company, citing a slowdown in sales last month.“The overall retail climate remains generally underwhelming,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst for Wolfe Research who downgraded the stock to hold from buy. “The climate appears to have deteriorated to a certain degree across retail from late March and into April.”A key challenge ahead for Target will be revamping its grocery department and improving the quality of its fresh foods and supply chain, Mushkin said. It will also have to battle increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc., which recently announced it would start offering a monthly Prime membership and is continuing to expand its same-day delivery.

""Older planes are much less fuel-efficient than new ones, but with oil at $40 a barrel rather than $100 a barrel, the higher cost of operating older aircraft is not nearly as bad.""That's just one of the reasons Heico is doing barrel rolls right now. Heico is drawing revenue from a number of sources, and sales are expected to accelerate from single-digit growth last year to double-digits this year.Part of that will come from an acquisition of a parts supplier to military helicopters, but in Heico's first fiscal quarter, which ended Jan. 31, the higher growth rate had already started showing up. Revenue grew 14% over the prior year to $306.2 million. Adjusted earnings rose 20% to 49 cents a share.The company raised its 2016 forecast on revenue and now expects growth of 14% to 15% vs. 8% to 10% previously, equating to $1.35 billion-$1.38 billion. It also raised its forecast for net income growth to 10% to 13% from 8% to 10%. Analysts expect total revenue to climb 15% this year to $1.37 billion, while per-share earnings are seen rising 16% to $2.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.Heico has the benefit of drawing business from both the commercial and military side of aerospace. So if there is a reduction in military spending, its commercial side can pick up some of the slack. But that's not the case right now.""The U.S. defense budget is rising again,"" Victor Mendelson, Heico’s co-president, told IBD, adding that foreign military budgets in the Middle East and among some other U.S. allies such as South Korea and Japan are also rising. ""NATO countries are involved in Syria and other hot spots. If these places heat up, there is a need for things we make.""In fact, both sides of the equation are humming, Mendelson says.""Air traffic is up,"" Mendelson said. ""It means that there are more planes flying, and there is greater flight frequency. The more the aircraft is utilized, the more parts Heico delivers. It’s wear and tear.""Heico manufactures and distributes a wide range of aircraft replacement parts, including combustion chambers for engines, fuel shut-off valves, back-up power supplies for emergency exit lighting, power converters on GPS satellites and even underwater-locator beacons, or ""pingers,"" for cockpit voice and data recorders, commonly known as black boxes.""Everything we do is a highly specialized niche,"" Mendelson said.Heico's military group is the smaller of its two main business units, with the flight support group the biggest. Revenue in the smaller division grew 17% to $104.2 million, reflecting acquisitions since last year, as well as 4% organic growth.First-quarter sales in the flight support group, which includes commercial aviation, rose 12% to $204.6 million, even on softer organic sales in its repair and overhaul services product line, as well as a slowdown in South America.Mendelson's co-president is his brother, Eric. Their father, Laurans Mendelson, is chairman and chief executive. The three took over the company in 1990, when it had just $26.5 million in sales, and then began an aggressive acquisition strategy to expand the firm’s product line. The South Florida-based company took in nearly $1.2 billion last year.""We knew nothing about aerospace, manufacturing or engineering. We knew about business,"" said Victor Mendelson. ""We thought we had a good idea -- to expand the parts business.""Heico is a bit like a generic-drug maker. It provides low-cost copies of original products, which are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration.""Our replacement parts demand is driven by aircraft use and the airlines’ need to save money,"" said Mendelson. ""Our replacement parts are sold for 20% to 30%, less than OEM (original equipment manufacturer) parts. We essentially copy the parts on the original plane.""Heico competes with smaller parts makers, as well as with the likes of General Electric (GE) and United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division. Heico supplies parts for just about every airline in the world, including United Continental (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Lufthansa, British Airways and JetBlue Airways (JBLU).Heico’s $255 million acquisition of Robertson Fuel Systems in January now provides it with crash-worthy auxiliary fuel systems for military helicopters such as Lockheed Martin's (LMT) Black Hawk and Boeing's (BA) Apache and Chinook. Management increased its outlook for its electronic technologies group -- where its military work is handled -- to reflect the Robertson acquisition.Though U.S. military spending is on the rise, proposed spending on some heavy helicopters will likely be pushed back another year. Still, Heico increased its revenue estimate in its electronic technologies group for the current year to growth of 27% to 30% to include gains from Robertson.""Because Robertson’s equipment has been made standard on more helicopters, that offsets the negative effect of fewer helicopters being produced,"" Victor Mendelson said.Robertson was Heico’s largest acquisition in a long string of buyouts, starting in 1990 when the company, under its new leaders, began to branch out from its original focus on aircraft engine parts.It’s made 60 purchases since then, eight of them last year alone. One was the purchase of 80% of privately held Aerospace & Commercial Technologies, which provides products and services to maintain the F-16 fighter fleet.About half of Heico’s revenue growth comes from acquisitions, and the rest from organic growth.""We’re working on a number of possibilities now,"" Mendelson said of potential candidates.

1274,GPS,"Stocks took a broad step higher Friday, giving the Nasdaq a narrow gap above its 200-day moving average.The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq climbed 0.8% each. Small-caps outpaced the general market, sending the Russell 2000 ahead 1.2%.The stock market today wrestled with mixed trade. Volume rose 7% on the NYSE, relative to action at the same time Thursday. But the Nasdaq's advance came in weak support, with volume slipping 7% below Thursday's morning levels.In economic news, the Commerce Department reported businesses saw wholesale inventories contract 0.5% in February. That was a faster decline than the 0.2% slip seen in January, and worse than the 0.2% decline expected by economist consensus.Oil futures accelerated their early advance, with West Texas intermediate surging more than 5% to above $39 a barrel. Prices may see some impact from the Baker Hughes (BHI) weekly rig count, due out at 1 p.m. ET.NRG Energy (NRG), Murphy Oil (MUR) and Chesapeake (CHK) were early gainers in the S&P 500.Nearly a third of the Dow stocks posted gains above 1%.

1275,GPS,"Gap founders Donald and Doris Fisher had already built their company into a specialty-apparel retail powerhouse by the time a new growth era took off in the mid-1980s.
"
1276,GPS,"Gap's name comes from the ""generation gap."" The Fishers built the company from one store in 1969 — selling teenagers records, tapes and Levi's jeans — to an international chain of 500 stores posting $480 million in annual sales in 1983.
"
1277,GPS,"Despite early success, the time came for a fresh perspective. Gap's performance had begun to lag, and ""change was necessary,"" says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail-consulting and investment-banking firm Davidowitz & Associates.
"
1278,GPS,"So in 1983, the Fishers hired Millard (Mickey) Drexler, a savvy merchandiser dubbed the ""Merchant Prince,"" whose innovations sparked rapid growth at Gap (GPS) — and in its stock price. From a March 1980 low to a February 2000 peak, Gap stock surged 157,988%, making the clothing company one of the 30 great stock leaders of the past three decades.
"
1279,GPS,"A Generation Of Gap
"
1280,GPS,"Drexler was hired because the Fishers wanted someone who had turned around an apparel chain. Drexler had spruced up Ann Taylor — which today is the public company Ann (ANN).
"
1281,GPS,"As executive vice president for merchandising and president for the Gap brand, and eventually as company CEO 1995-2002, Drexler ""reinvigorated"" Gap, Davidowitz said, and ""put the people and systems in place that could execute what he wanted to do.""
"
1282,GPS,"The overhaul ran from merchandising, store layout and marketing to clothing design, and Gap transformed the retail landscape in the process.
"
1283,GPS,"""One of Drexler's talents is the ability to select people, motivate them and manage them effectively. He built an in-house team of designers who developed products, communicated with the factories and were a key part of the planning process that determined merchandise assortment, quantity and flow,"" Davidowitz said. ""This gave Gap a significant competitive edge.""
"
1284,GPS,"On the sourcing side, Drexler used his familiarity with apparel manufacturing in China to select reliable factories that provided consistently high quality and shipped on time. He also put in place a planning and distribution method that supported frequent changes of merchandise sets at stores to keep things fresh.
"
1285,GPS,"Quite a far cry from that $480 million in 1983 sales, Gap delivered $16.15 billion in revenue last year.
"
1286,GPS,"""The company's success over more than four decades goes back to the Fishers' constantly staying ahead of customers and staying true to our value of doing more than sell clothes,"" Bill Chandler, Gap's senior vice president of global affairs, told IBD in an email interview. ""The company has grown, first in North America and now around the world, by making fashion accessible for all customers and generations. Our mission is to become the world's favorite for American style.""
"
1287,GPS,"Gap introduced its own clothing label in 1972, but the big transformation began when Drexler came onboard a little more than a decade later. The company acquired a two-store mail-order business called Banana Republic, which became the high end in Gap's innovative segmented approach to retailing. Old Navy would later become its low end. In 2003, Drexler moved on to helm preppy J. Crew.
"
1288,GPS,"1980s Power Brand

1289,GPS,"Retail began a period of transformation in the 1980s and early 1990s, and Gap led it, says Lawrence Creatura, vice president and portfolio manager at Federated Investors.
"
1290,GPS,"""The foundation of their success and innovation was a lucky intersection of correct personalities and strategies in a world when systems and distribution were becoming simultaneously more sophisticated, so that great people with great ideas could power these concepts broadly in an efficient manner and reap economies of scale,"" he said. ""That's what led to an explosive experience for shareholders of Gap.""
"
1291,GPS,"During its high-growth period in the 1980s, Gap ""pioneered"" an approach to retail that took into account the ""psychology"" of its customers, Creatura says.
"
1292,GPS,"""They were better at looking at the shopping experience through the customer's eyes and maximizing the fulfillment a customer got when they walked into the store, including everything from the layout and fixtures to the color palettes used,"" he said.
"
1293,GPS,"Prior to the changes in the Gap store experience in the 1980s, Creatura adds, stores weren't ""customer-centric.""
"
1294,GPS,"""Gap made the trip into the store not about clothing but rather about feelings, and that led to a deeper and ultimately more successful connection with their customers,"" Creatura said.

1295,GPS,"'Newfound Flair For Fashion'
"
1296,GPS,"How important was Gap in the transformation of the American clothing-store landscape?
"
1297,GPS,"NPD Group chief industry analyst Marshal Cohen said, ""They were at the beginning of the apparel surge we saw in the 1980s. They had a really good run at the beginning of that and were part of the impetus to create that run. They were one of the catalysts to help drive the newfound flair for fashion because they made it affordable and convenient (with so many locations) and so simple for people to engage in fashion.""
"
1298,GPS,"Underpinning its marketing, Gap leveraged technology to track costs and plan product development, manufacturing and distribution.
"
1299,GPS,"""Decisions were made based on the information gleaned from the ERP (enterprise resource planning) software,"" Creatura said. ""ERP was fairly new as Gap was ascending — Gap was among the first retailers to leverage its capabilities.""
"
1300,GPS,"The approach let Gap scale up, putting a ""homogenous retail concept in many different locations, in a cookie-cutter fashion, rolled out in similar spaces in malls across America,"" Creatura said.
"
1301,GPS,"In merchandising, Drexler's approach was to bring ""key items"" such as jeans, khakis and T-shirts that had fashion flair and were cost-efficient, says Cohen. They produced in big quantities so they could sell at good prices. They had a high margin, Cohen adds.
"
1302,GPS,"Cohen says that Gap took casual dressing to the ""street"" and made it a lifestyle rather than a category.
"
1303,GPS,"""They were able to say: This is the best (pair of) khakis or jeans, and this is how to put them together,"" he said. ""They made dressing simple.""
"
1304,GPS,"A Lock On The Look
"
1305,GPS,"The biggest thing that Drexler did for Gap was create a ""gigantic"" in-house design staff, Davidowitz says. Drexler closed the New York office and brought designers to Gap's San Francisco home base, where they developed simple, casual clothes.
"
1306,GPS,"Another innovation came with Gap's ability to ""exploit niches"" in the marketplace, says Davidowitz.
"
1307,GPS,"First came buying Banana Republic in 1983 to cater to higher-end tastes. Later, he says, Gap perceived retailers such as Target (TGT) as a ""real threat and underselling"" Gap stores with low prices.

"

"
1319,GPS,"The strong showing follows a modest 2.8% comp gain in March. Combined March-April same-store sales are up a ""solid"" 4.7% from a year earlier, says Perkins.
"
1320,GPS,"The April results were driven by warmer weather in the first half of the month through Easter, which Perkins says helped fuel holiday-related sales and unleash pent-up demand for spring merchandise.

"
1334,GPS,"Perkins calls the month's showing ""one of the first encouraging developments"" all year for what has been a very ""tough year for retailers.""
"
1335,GPS,"""When you look in totality how everyone did, I think it's an encouraging sign as we head into May,"" he added.
"
1336,GPS,"Perkins says April's reading ""suggests that consumer spending might be on the mend. Big-ticket purchases have run pretty strong over the last few months. It looks to have translated into some pent-up demand and a strong April.""
"
1337,GPS,"Still, he said, ""we need to see a carry-through into May with solid Mother's Day and Memorial Day sales to feel comfortable that a trend is in place and the consumer is feeling better.""
"
1338,GPS,"Niemira added that April's results make him ""more optimistic."" He says we're likely to see a ""firming"" in retail spending.
"
1339,GPS,"""I don't think all of a sudden we're out of the woods,"" Niemira said. ""Demand still will be choppy. The consumer still shops in spurts, driven by holidays, promotions and other events.""

"
1343,GPS,"He added: ""In order to be reassured that the pickup we're currently seeing can be sustained, what we will need to see is some other economic metrics continue to improve, whether it's income growth or employment growth.""
"
1344,GPS,"Niemira said he would also like to see a ""healthier teen market"" in terms of employment and spending.

Action sports retailer Zumiez came in with a healthy 8.2% same-store sales gain for last month vs. forecasts for a 1% increase.Costco saw a healthy 5% same-store sales gain, despite being closed on Easter Sunday and having one less selling day.It topped views for a 4.2% rise, and international business was even stronger at a 7% increase. For the combined March/April period, Costco reported a solid 5% increase as well.Off-price retailer Stein Mart rang up an impressive 8.9% gain in same-store sales, ahead of views for a 3% increase.Perkins calls the month's showing ""one of the first encouraging developments"" all year for what has been a very ""tough year for retailers.""""When you look in totality how everyone did, I think it's an encouraging sign as we head into May,"" he added.Perkins says April's reading ""suggests that consumer spending might be on the mend. Big-ticket purchases have run pretty strong over the last few months. It looks to have translated into some pent-up demand and a strong April.""Still, he said, ""we need to see a carry-through into May with solid Mother's Day and Memorial Day sales to feel comfortable that a trend is in place and the consumer is feeling better.""Niemira added that April's results make him ""more optimistic."" He says we're likely to see a ""firming"" in retail spending.""I don't think all of a sudden we're out of the woods,"" Niemira said. ""Demand still will be choppy. The consumer still shops in spurts, driven by holidays, promotions and other events.""A Merry Month?Niemira forecasts that May same-store sales will rise 3% to 3.5% from a year earlier.""It isn't a bad performance,"" he said. ""But it certainly pales in comparison to the April reading.""He added: ""In order to be reassured that the pickup we're currently seeing can be sustained, what we will need to see is some other economic metrics continue to improve, whether it's income growth or employment growth.""Niemira said he would also like to see a ""healthier teen market"" in terms of employment and spending. Perkins added that his sense is same-store sales will return to a ""more normal pattern"" in May, with an increase of 2.5% to 3.5% from a year earlier.

1346,GPS,"Wall Street's early gains faded into the close Friday, as upbeat comments from Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen failed to assuage investor worries about the global economy.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each edged up 0.2%, while the Nasdaq added 0.1%. All three indexes were up as much as 0.9% in early trading. Volume was lower in the stock market today, sliding 13% on the Nasdaq and by 2% on the NYSE compared to Thursday, according to preliminary data.Oil stocks were the best performers after Yellen said late Thursday that economic growth remains on track, and New York Fed chief William Dudley said early Friday that he favors only gradual interest-rate hikes.However, a bigger-than-expected 0.5% drop in February wholesale inventories and a downward revision to January stockpiles sparked concerns that Q1 GDP growth may be weaker than expected.Apparel stocks were among the day's worst performers, led by Gap (GPS), which dropped 14% in huge volume after the company released disappointing March sales figures and said it was entering April with higher inventories than planned.GIII Apparel (GIII) fell more than 5%, and IBD 50 stock Michael Kors (KORS) lost nearly 5%, piercing its 50-day moving average.On the plus side, Weibo (WB) -- sometimes dubbed the Twitter (TWTR) of China -- jumped  4% to a new high in heavy volume on talk that Alibaba Group (BABA) may increase its stake in the social media company. It's risen beyond the 5% buy zone from a 19.20 buy point of a cup-with-handle base.Alcoa (AA) kicks off the Q1 earnings season on Monday, followed later in the week by building products retailer Fastenal (FAST), Bank of America (BAC), JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and others.Economic data due next week include the producer and consumer price indexes, retail sales and industrial production, all for March.

1347,GPS,"Stocks sharply pared their gains in early afternoon trade Friday, despite dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials and a surge in crude oil prices.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each held a 0.3% gain, while the Nasdaq was flirting with negative territory. Volume was slightly higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq. Winners outpaced losers by a 3-1 margin on the NYSE and by about 5-to-4 on the Nasdaq.Energy, steel and gold mining stocks led the upside in the stock market today. West Texas intermediate crude prices were up more than 6% to $39.59 a barrel. On the Dow, Chevron (CVX) rose 2% and Exxon Mobil (XOM) 1%.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was the top gainer on the IBD 50, gapping up and rising 3% to a new high in fast trade. The stock is now extended from a 188.58 buy point initially cleared March 11. The beauty store operator will join the S&P 500 index at the close April 15.Apparel, biotech and department store stocks led the downside. Gap (GPS) gapped down and sank 14%, breaching its 50-day moving average in heavy turnover. The apparel retailer late Thursday said March same-store-sales fell 6% compared with a 2% gain the prior year.Among other apparel retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and L Brands (LB) shed 3% and 4%, respectively.Facebook (FB) fell 3% in above-average volume. The stock is shaping a handle to a cup base, for a 117.09 buy point. The social network is trying to reverse a double-digit slide in personal posts by users, according to a report published by The Information Web news site.LinkedIn (LNKD) gave up 4% as the stock continues to trade near three-year lows. MKM Partners lowered its rating on the career networking site to buy from neutral and cut its price target to 130 from 150.In economic news, wholesale inventories contracted 0.5% in February, worse than January's 0.2% dip and economists' forecasts for a 0.2% decline.Image provided by Shutterstock.

1348,GPS,"Federal regulators appear to be warming up to a radio spectrum proposal from Ligado Networks, formerly LightSquared, which could provide AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) or T-Mobile US (TMUS) with a new strategic option -- but could spell trouble for Dish Network (DISH) and its spectrum holdings.The Federal Communications Commission recently began its Broadcast Incentive Auction involving airwaves owned by local TV stations. The top bidders are expected to be AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. The complex auction is expected to drag on for months.Ligado’s re-emergence from Chapter 11 has been a wild card. Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile might be less likely to buy Dish’s spectrum or partner with the satellite TV broadcaster if Ligado’s spectrum becomes commercially available. Dish has struggled to find a wireless partner to pursue mobile video services.Former Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg is chairman of Ligado, while former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt is a board member. Ligado, controlled by private equity firms, has a sizable 35 megahertz of midband spectrum.“Recent filings suggest the FCC may soon open inquiry on Ligado’s new spectrum proposal,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners, in a research report. “We believe Ligado’s restructured spectrum plan stands a reasonable chance of winning FCC approval.“If Ligado’s path to market becomes clear, it (would be) a long-term positive for Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, and a potential concern for Dish’s spectrum valuation (if Dish has not already monetized its spectrum).”After emerging from bankruptcy, Ligado has reached agreements with tractor maker Deere (DE) and GPS device maker Garmin (GRMN), resolving issues over potential global positioning system interference.

1349,GPS,"How close are self-driving cars from moving from the drawing board to a road near you?By 2025, the full universe of vehicles with some autonomous features, such as highway autopilot or autonomous valet parking, is expected to reach 12% to 13% of car sales globally, representing a market of about $42 billion for those features, excluding the base price of the cars, according to the Boston Consulting Group.By 2035 -- about the time today's toddlers will be out of college and in the car market -- sales of fully autonomous vehicles will comprise 9.8% of the global market for new light vehicle sales, or about a $38 billion market for autonomous-vehicle features, according to BCG.That means a significant rollout of new-from-the-ground-up autonomous cars ""may take decades,"" as the 262 million registered passenger vehicles on U.S. roads now carry an average age 11.5 years, Glen DeVos, vice president of global engineering and services at car parts supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH), told a Senate committee last month.The two-hour hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation featured testimony from top leaders of the self-driving car efforts at Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, automaker General Motors (GM), ride-hailing service Lyft and Delphi, all firms that are positioning themselves to profit from cutting-edge technology its proponents say could alleviate traffic jams, lead to a reduction in driver-caused car accidents and deaths, and even bring newfound travel freedom to people who are elderly or blind.Besides noting how far the technology has come, legislative experts at the Senate hearing also shed light on the numerous safety, regulatory, infrastructure and other concerns that the advanced technology must overcome if auto-drive vehicles are ever to become commonplace.Read on for a primer covering where self-driving cars now stand.Besides Google, what other companies are working on self-driving cars?Google, the public face of the self-driving car development effort, says its test fleet of autonomous cars and SUVs has driven 1.4 million miles since the effort started in earnest in 2009. That's paltry compared with the 1.4 million miles that New York taxicabs collectively cover in just over a day, according to Senate hearing testimony from Mary Louise Cummings, director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab and Duke Robotics at Duke University. Before autonomous cars can be deemed as safe as human drivers, Cummings said, the Rand Corporation think tank believes the technology needs to have driven 275 million miles, fatality-free. So far, Google's auto-drive fleet has been tested in California, Texas, Washington and Arizona.Apple (AAPL) is also reportedly working on a self-driving car, although the company has not commented on its plans.Other tech firms developing auto-drive vehicles include the ""Google of China"" -- Baidu (BIDU), the country's No. 1 Internet search provider. The company's ""deep learning"" artificial intelligence research lab has been working on its project for three years. In December, Baidu announced that its modified BMW 3-Series had completed an 18.6-mile lap that included highways and side streets around capital city Beijing. The Chinese web giant was readying to test its self-driving cars on American roads.Baidu has been developing technology related to the car at a research center in California. Underpinning the self-driving car project is Baidu's data-mapping service. Baidu is also pursuing the development of computer vision and other necessary technologies.In March, Detroit auto giant GM signaled its self-driving car intentions by announcing the acquisition of Cruise Automation, a San Francisco-based maker of driverless car technology. Cruise's main product, the Cruise RP-1 autopilot system, can be installed in cars made by Volkswagen (VLKAY)-owned Audi and those made by Nissan (NSANY), owned by Renault.GM, which says it has more Internet-connected cars than any other original equipment manufacturer, also said it has established a separate unit for autonomous vehicle development. That group will produce cars offering hands-free automated driving on freeways with proper lane markings by 2016. GM said, however, that drivers will have to be ready to take over control of the vehicle and cars will be fitted with a device designed to alert the driver to pay attention, even as the car self-navigates on the highway.Last fall, Tesla Motors (TSLA) began introducing advanced Autopilot software features, such as the ability to steer within a lane and change lanes on the highway, after outfitting its electric cars with the necessary hardware starting in 2014 -- but it stressed that Autosteer is still in beta-testing stage, with drivers required to ""remain engaged and aware"" with hands on the steering wheel. This year, Tesla introduced the first version of Summon, in which drivers can use a smartphone to prompt their Model S or Model X cars to open a home garage door, drive in, park themselves and shut down. Once they’re ready to go again, drivers can use the technology to summon the car to leave the garage and come to them, which Tesla said could eventually eliminate “the burden of having to squeeze in and out of tight parking spots.”Ford (F) announced in 2013 that it's working on a car that drives itself, while Renault and Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has said that his companies plan to offer 10 autonomous-drive models by 2020. Volvo, already testing auto drive cars in Sweden, said last week that it is expanding the testing to China. Volvo is wholly owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.Other carmakers are planning to release vehicles with various ""advanced driver assistance systems"" -- including Toyota's (TM) crash-avoidance technology for Toyota and Lexus models -- by 2017. And some such technology is already on the road. For instance, Daimler (DDAIF) offers a system on certain models that allows a car to brake, accelerate and remain in its lane without human intervention at speeds of under 16 miles an hour, according to a February 2015 report from the Insurance Information Institute. Daimler, Volkswagen, Volvo, BMW, Tesla and several other automakers have complex self-driving car projects underway.U.S. auto safety regulators said this month that 20 automakers have agreed to make automatic emergency braking standard on nearly all U.S. vehicles by 2022, a move that could prevent thousands of rear-end crashes annually.
"
1350,GPS,"How much will fully self-driving vehicles cost?The Boston Consulting Group estimates a sticker price of $10,000 above a regular car's price for fully autonomous capability.Why so much?A wealth of technology is required to make the systems work, and many companies are involved in their development.Within the vehicle, those expected to cost the most include Global Positioning System, or GPS, units. There's also LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), a laser beam technology used in police speed-detection guns. Using reflected light coming from everything around the car, the system creates a real-time 3D map that can be used as a guide to help keep the vehicle on the road and at a proper distance from other cars.Video cameras, sensors using radar and a central computer to analyze all the information coming in make self-driving systems work and are expected to drive up the vehicle’s price tag. ""In an automated future, we need to be able to communicate not just with the driver or the owner, but also the surrounding environment. Knowing when traffic signals are going to change and where vehicle traffic is heaviest not only adds to the safety of the vehicle, but also allows the cars to be driven -- or to drive themselves -- more efficiently,"" said Delphi Automotive's DeVos.What other concerns did lawmakers discuss at the Senate hearing?Regulations governing the use of autonomous cars was a major issue. ""Over the past two years, 23 states have introduced 53 pieces of legislation that affect autonomous vehicles, all of which include differ approaches and concepts,” said Chris Urmson, director of the self-driving car program at Google X. The laws could makes it more difficult to get self-driving cars on the road in some states or make it harder to take a self-driving car across state lines.To bring some regulatory certainty for the companies, the Department of Transportation is in the process of creating a model policy state regulators and lawmakers could use to craft their own self-driving car regulations. The federal government is aiming to define best practices for operating self-driving cars by the end of July. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) will work with states and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators -- a group representing state motor-vehicle agencies -- to craft a path to consistent autonomous-car policies to avoid a patchwork of state regulations.The issue of retrofitting older vehicles with the new technology also arose. When asked which regulator would carry responsibility for overseeing quality standards if older cars were outfitted with auto-drive features, GM Vice President Michael Ableson said, ""We don't see this technology necessarily being applicable as far as retrofitting to vehicles. You need to touch a number of the fundamental systems in the car. You need to design in redundancy that's not here today. The idea of trying to take that system and somehow retrofit it on an existing car? We don’t see a path to be able to do that.""Cyberhacking was a major issue raised, as was the need for driver privacy standards for self-driving and Internet-connected cars, which have been likened to ""computers on wheels."" Last July, Sens. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced legislation that would require automobile manufacturers to build IT security standards into connected cars.The so-called SPY Car Act (Security and Privacy in Your Car) would direct the NHTSA and the Federal Trade Commission to create IT security and privacy standards to secure high-tech cars and protect drivers’ privacy. The proposed legislation also establishes a rating system -- or “cyber dashboard” -- to tell consumers how well the vehicle protects drivers’ security and privacy beyond those minimum standards.Other concerns included safety and whether some technologies may not work in certain conditions, such as in cities with tall buildings could that block GPS signals or in extreme weather such as heavy rain or snows that could render LiDAR useless.What's with ride-share company Lyft's involvement?Getting people to try summoning a ride in a self-driving car could be a baby step toward widespread adoption, according to Lyft. That company is working with GM to bring self-driving cars into its program and let people warm to the experience of self-driving technology without having to buy it, Joseph Okpaku, vice president of government relations for Lyft, told the Senate committee.GM has also entered into a strategic alliance with Lyft and formed Maven, its brand for car-sharing fleets planned for launch in various U.S. cities.That might be a tall order. A survey released by AAA in March found that 75% of 1,800 drivers polled would not feel safe riding in an autonomous car, although 60% of them would be open to a self-driving car feature, such as automatic braking or self-parking, the next time they buy a new vehicle.Are any automakers shunning the industry's self-driving car push?That would be high performance carmaker Porsche. ""An iPhone belongs in your pocket, not on the road,"" Porsche CEO Oliver Blume told a German newspaper earlier this year.At a public hearing on Friday held by the NHTSA, the Global Automakers industry group asked U.S. officials to slow down while creating regulations for autonomous driving technology. NHTSA said in January that it is working on new guidance on self-driving vehicles to states and automakers, aiming for a release by July.In the meantime, several speakers at last week’s hearing said self-driving vehicles are not ready for prime time, citing their inability to operate in snow or react quickly enough if others behave recklessly on the road.""Self-driving robot cars simply aren't ready to safely manage too many routine traffic situations without human intervention,"" Consumer Watchdog privacy project director John Simpson said at the hearing. “Deploying a vehicle today without a steering wheel, brake, accelerator and a human driver capable of intervening when something goes wrong is not merely foolhardy. It is dangerous,” Simpson testified.In December, California proposed state regulations that would require all autonomous cars to have a steering wheel, throttle and brake pedals when operating on state roads. A licensed driver would need to be in the driver's seat ready to take over in the event something went wrong.

1351,GPS,"Billions of Apple (AAPL) iPhones and iPads could be exposed in an iOS 9 vulnerability, Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) researchers announced early Thursday, in preparation of presenting their findings at Singapore's Black Hat Asia 2016 conference late Thursday U.S. time.Enterprise applications installed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) software are exempt from Apple’s latest security changes, which means that an attacker can hijack legitimate communications to install malicious apps, says the security firm.It’s still theoretical, Avi Rembaum, Check Point vice president of security solutions, told IBD on Wednesday. Black Hat gives researchers an opportunity to discuss hypothetical threat vectors, including this new so-called ""SideStepper"" vulnerability.""Unfortunately, a lot of those things we talk about that might happen often end up happening,"" he said.Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. Apple stock was down a fraction in late-afternoon trading in the stock market today.Apple recognized a key piece of the SideStepper vulnerability in iOS 8. For $299 a year, an enterprise can purchase an Apple certificate to upload a private app via the Apple Developer Enterprise Program.""But if someone is going to be malicious, they don’t really care about signing a (certificate) agreement, plus it’s $299 per year to get that certificate,"" Rembaum said. ""There weren't many barriers to entry.""Enterprises are headily embracing the ""Bring Your Own Device"" trend and, in one case study of a Fortune 100 company, Check Point found 318 private apps and 116 unique certificates on employees' devices. Those numbers were suspiciously high, Rembaum said.""When we looked deeper ... they were on the sketchier side and were from parts of the world that could be problematic,"" he said. ""We saw a very small number of them that would be considered white-listed (trustworthy).""So in iOS 9, Apple upped the challenges to installation, says Check Point. But the new challenges don’t cover MDM-pushed updates to employees’ devices. Of the 1.2 billion installed iPhones and iPads, 79% have iOS installed and are therefore vulnerable.Enterprises often rely on MDM services like those by BlackBerry (BBRY) (via its Good Technology acquisition), VMWare (VMW) and MobileIron (MOBL) to push updates onto employees’ devices, thereby avoiding the ""headache"" of ensuring that every app has identical settings, Rembaum said.That MDM-device connection, however, is also a powerful portal for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, he said. A hacker can, theoretically, intercept the communications between MDM and device to install a certificate and then a malicious app.Often, the interception relies on social engineering, he said.""An attacker would send a text message to the target with a link to download the configuration file,"" he said. ""It would install a certificate and configuration instructions in the phone. The only thing the user has to do is say yes to installing.""Then the attacker is in -- with access to a user's address book, microphone, photos, GPS, apps and, possibly, company data.Rembaum recommends that MDM users take a ""multilayer approach"" to mobile security. Because hackers often rely on social engineering to launch phishing attacks -- by email, text message or social media -- enterprises should train employees on red flags.Phishing attacks cost businesses more than $215 million between October 2013 and December 2014, according to a January report by the FBI.This month, Seagate Technology (STX) discovered that it had been duped into handing out nearly 10,000 W-2 forms belonging to former and current employees. The Seagate revelation came on the heels of a similar attack on privately held Snapchat.Scammers often change a single letter in an email address or impersonate a CEO's email address, Barracuda Networks’ (CUDA) Slawek Ligier and Proofpoint’s (PFPT) Ryan Kalember told IBD.Outside education, an enterprise can install Check Point’s Mobile Threat Prevention (MTP) software and have its employees install the ZoneAlarm app, Rembaum said. FireEye (FEYE), Symantec (SYMC), Intel’s (INTC) McAfee, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Proofpoint also compete in the mobile security space.A MitM attacker creates an encrypted tunnel -- typically through a virtual private network (VPN) -- to its own site, directing a user away from the legitimate MDM. Check Point’s MTP solution hunts down that encrypted tunnel.""The user would have received the text, clicked on the link and installed the certificate,"" Rembaum said. ""Then (Check Point’s software) would reach out and block the connection.""He added: ""The actual installation of the malware wouldn’t have succeeded.""

1352,GPS,"America Humiliated: What Iran got from detaining and debasing U.S. sailors two months ago could fill a book. In fact, Tehran boasts 13,000 pages of information from their computers and plans a book on the incident.We as Americans, blessed to live in the greatest -- and for over a century the most powerful -- country in the world, are inclined to regard images, symbolism and propaganda as having little ability to harm us. But the world's lone superpower over seven-plus years of the Obama presidency has been in an aerodynamic stall; visuals like the photo of the Iranians pointing guns at our naval personnel are the klaxons in the cockpit sounding warnings to the deaf ears of an incompetent pilot: the commander-in-chief and author of U.S. decline.Some symbolic incidents that America's enemies sought to exploit melt away and are today largely forgotten. In 1984, during the sound check before his weekly radio address, President Reagan joked: ""I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever; we begin bombing in five minutes."" Moscow called the humor ""incompatible with the great responsibility borne by heads of nuclear states"" and Western Europe's left had a conniption fit.But Reagan's actions over eight years proved he was no joker. And far from being the warmonger he was so often called, he proved he was actually a peacemaker -- through strength, of course.The viral video of 10 American sailors, one a woman, held at gunpoint by Iran's Revolutionary Guard on Jan. 12, with one of them later taped while in custody apologizing for U.S. actions, is something that might have been expected to melt away out of the collective memory by now. It is not.On Tuesday, Revolutionary Guard naval commander Ali Razmjou boasted that Iran grabbed hold of 13,000 pages of information from the computers, GPS devices and maps on board the two small U.S. Navy CB-90 fast assault craft. The Pentagon isn't disclosing whether any of it was classified, but it's hard to imagine that a U.S. patrol operating near the world's foremost terrorist state wouldn't have sensitive materials aboard. The Defense Department had previously claimed that all the Iranians secured were two digital SIM cards from satellite phones.Has the White House ordered that a security breach be covered up? We may find out if the Iranians share some of the 13,000 pages. Nevertheless, the image of Iran having the upper hand over our military so soon after President Obama's nuclear appeasement deal refuses to fade out.The details cry out for investigation. How could a U.S. vessel have been allowed to break down in Iranian waters? Is our Navy that badly equipped? Why would a U.S. Navy officer apologize, especially with cameras rolling? How, in spite of Navy training, could a briefly detained sailor be videotaped crying by the enemy?Razmjou added that the Revolutionary Guard will publish a book on the episode -- in other words yet more bang for the Iranian rial is on its way from a single incident of U.S. humiliation.This image-based propaganda victory is symbolic of something very concrete: ongoing American decline.
"
1353,GPS,"Federal regulators appear set to go forward this spring with the auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters, but other spectrum-related developments loom as wild cards that could increase supply, thereby impacting wireless industry competition and M&As.Those other developments include the contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety; the re-emergence of LightSquared, renamed Ligado Networks, from Chapter 11; and whether wireless firms succeed in lobbying to use commercial LTE technology in unlicensed spectrum now allocated to Wi-Fi.The Federal Communications Commission still plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29. The auction, which could last five to six months, will free up an estimated 60 megahertz to 80 MHz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum for wireless services.Results of the spectrum auction could affect the competitive future of IBD Leaderboard company AT&T (T), which has seen accelerating growth in recent quarters, and rival Verizon Communications (VZ) -- a member of IBD’s Big Cap 20 -- as well as highly rated Comcast (CMCSA). AT&T and Verizon are expected to buy TV airwaves in the auction, and cable leader Comcast also will likely bid, say analysts. Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has ruled itself out.AT&T and Verizon own more than 70% of low-frequency airwaves in the top 100 U.S. markets. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and can pass through walls, improving in-building services.The FCC will impose a ""quiet period"" that bans negotiation over spectrum until the auction is over. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) has acquired some 75 MHz of midband spectrum -- which covers a little less territory than low-frequency spectrum -- but it lacks a wireless network partner and is in limbo until the auction ends, analysts say. Dish has filed to bid in the auction, but observers are uncertain that it will.The auction's outcome could well raise or lower the odds of some major deals, long rumored in the industry:-- that Comcast will acquire a wireless services provider;-- that a cable TV leader will strike an alliance with Verizon;-- that Verizon will enter into a spectrum-leasing deal with Dish;-- that Dish and T-Mobile will merge.But even beyond the auction, by early 2017, further developments involving the FirstNet contract, Ligado, unlicensed-LTE and satellite wireless firm Globalstar (GSAT) could impact Dish’s plans, as well as the spectrum strategies of AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. That’s because all these elements provide alternatives for network capacity, aside from the auction.Here’s a run-down of several scenarios:-- FirstNet. Whoever wins this first-responder contract would need to invest in network infrastructure. Congress has set aside 20 MHz of spectrum -- a wide swath of the airwaves -- in the ""D block"" of the 700 MHz frequency band for the public safety network.The winning bidder is expected to enter into a lease agreement with the FirstNet authority for access to the 20 MHz of prime airwaves. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.The government will award the FirstNet contract after the TV airwave auction ends, if the government's timetable proceeds as planned. Verizon has been viewed as the front-runner, but AT&T has made clear that it’s interested. T-Mobile (TMUS) could bid but faces long odds vs. AT&T and Verizon, analysts say.-- LTE-U. Verizon and T-Mobile have been biggest proponents of developing a technical standard that would allow 4G LTE commercial technology to use unlicensed spectrum. Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and the Wi-Fi Alliance, which certifies Wi-Fi network gear, have lobbied the FCC to protect unlicensed airwaves, saying that interference could impair Wi-Fi services. Apple (AAPL), a Wi-Fi Alliance member, has not said anything publicly.Verizon and AT&T claim that no special LTE-U equipment certification is needed as long as devices meet certain basic FCC rules for unlicensed spectrum. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has been backing LTE-U deployment. The FCC in February allowed Qualcomm to move ahead with LTE-U testing at two Verizon facilities to demonstrate that the technology would not interfere with Wi-Fi. Qualcomm and the Wi-Fi Alliance have been working on “coexistence” plans.The cable TV industry has a big stake in the outcome, analysts say, because Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and others have been expanding public Wi-Fi networks. While Verizon has targeted 3.5 GHz spectrum in the near term, it could try to carry out LTE-U in higher 5 GHz airwaves that cable TV firms covet.If LTE-U gets a green light, the Apple iPhone and other devices could support the technology by 2018.-- LightSquared, now Ligado. Former Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg is chairman of Ligado, while former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt is a board member.Ligado, controlled by private equity firms, has a sizable 35 MHz of midband spectrum. After emerging from bankruptcy, Ligado reached agreements with tractor maker Deere (DE) and GPS device maker Garmin (GRMN), resolving issues over potential global positioning system interference. While Ligado might provide services to industries such as energy or transport, or pursue next-generation 5G services, it could sell the airwaves as well.The company hasn’t spelled out its new business model, analysts say, and it’s still awaiting some FCC approvals to use the spectrum for commercial purposes.-- Globalstar.  The FCC has been studying Globalstar’s petition to use airwaves in the midfrequency 2.4 GHz block for wireless services. The Wi-Fi Alliance and other groups have opposed Globalstar’s plans, citing possible interference issues. Globalstar could lease capacity to a wireless firm or an Internet company if it wins at the FCC. Globalstar’s stock, though, has plunged about 50% in the past year to near 1.40 while its FCC approval has languished.Image provided by Shutterstock.

1354,GPS,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Gemalto exec David Etue hinged the success of the nascent Internet of Things industry -- and its 30 billion connected devices in four years -- to an efficient software update process.Because when 30 billion devices are connected to the Internet, there's a lot that can go wrong ... and fast.""Our adversaries are highly motivated,"" Etue told attendees at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, a major annual gathering of security companies. ""But if we can get a secure software update process right, at least we can make changes.""He added: ""If we get this right, this puts us in a position for long-term success.""France-based Gemalto competes in the software application and secured devices market, and therefore has a big dog in the upcoming Internet of Things fight for market share.Although the IoT presents a huge market opportunity for tech and pure cybersecurity players, its mass scale also terrifies chief information security officers, Etue said.""We don't generally intentionally put our IoT-connected devices in hostile territory,"" he said. ""We might put them on the local Starbucks (SBUX) Wi-Fi. ... That's not that scary when it's your fitness meter. It's pretty scary when it's a pacemaker.""On the business side, retail stores use sensors to count shoppers -- information hedge funds used to pay people to gather outside brick-and-mortar establishments. Farmers use devices to track the development of seeds. Tesla Motors (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Toyota (TM), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Ford (F) are already racing toward autonomous vehicles.""So we're seeing a lot of demand to monetize this data,"" Etue said.But on the flip side, consumers are spooked after a fault in Fiat Chrysler's (FCAU) Jeep Cherokee GPS system allowed it to be hacked, Rapid7 (RPD) researchers were able to hack baby monitors and Santa Cruz, Calif., residents protested smart meters.""We get really excited about the device, but forget about where that data is from and how it's being managed,"" Etue said.He suggests consumers and developers ask themselves a series of questions before taking on Internet of Things devices. Most of those questions center on how, where and what data are stored; whether it's accessible by a third party; and who manages the accessibility.""We're never going to get this right the first time,"" he said. ""We're going to have to change.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

1355,GPS,"Retailers likely saw sluggish January sales gains as consumers took a breather after the holidays, and as abnormally warm weather in recent months left shelves bulging with cold-weather apparel.As of Wednesday, analysts were expecting sales at stores open at least a year to increase 0.3% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. The final tally for the month will be released Thursday.Perkins said inventories appeared to be ""elevated a bit"" in January due to unseasonably warm weather throughout November and December. Traffic and conversion from storage to sales ""decelerated"" from December, which is a typical trend following the holiday selling season, he added.Considered the final month of the retail calendar, January is primarily a transitional period, Perkins noted in his report. Most retailers mark down holiday and winter merchandise to make room for early spring products in early February.""January is the least important month of the (retail) calendar fourth quarter for virtually all retailers, and (I) would not read too much into January results,"" Perkins said.Still, overall top-line growth has been tough to come by for many retailers, noted Perkins. L Brands (LB) and Costco Wholesale (COST) -- for its core U.S. comps -- are the only retailers in Perkins' index of monthly forecasts to generate January same-store sales growth greater than 2%, he added.Amazon (AMZN) and other online retailers continue to gain share from traditional mall-based chains.""While Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings and sales results disappointed investors, the leading online retailer still managed to generate 22% revenue growth, a good chunk of which is coming out of mall-based and big-box retailers,"" Perkins said. ""Fierce competition from fast fashion, off-price, discount and e-commerce is putting added pressure on revenue and earnings growth.""Analysts expect fourth-quarter same-store sales for the retail industry to rise a sluggish 0.9%, Perkins said. They estimate fourth-quarter retail industry earnings will decline 1.5% from a year earlier, he added, noting that this would be the first quarterly retail earnings decline since the first quarter of 2014.""Flat"" consumer spending in December and continued ""heavy discounting"" and promotions -- which decreases the dollar value of sales -- are among the factors impacting January same-store sales, Perkins said. And strong auto sales are likely ""crowding out"" spending at traditional retailers.Perkins said monthly reports in the Retail Metrics index have surprised on the upside in three of the last four months. But given the ""sizable miss"" posted by Rite Aid (RAD), it may be more difficult to beat expectations once again, he said. Rite Aid reported  a 1.4% decline in January same-store sales on Jan. 28, missing views for a 0.2% gain.Warehouse club giant Costco is expected to show a 0.7% increase in January same-store sales. Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, which exclude the impact of gas and foreign-exchange volatility, are seen growing a healthy 3.6%.Elsewhere, L Brands, Victoria Secret's parent and typically a strong retail performer, is expected to see a 2.5% gain in January same-store sales.Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) is seen showing a 3.9% decline in January same-store sales when it reports on Monday.Also, PriceSmart (PSMT), which owns and operates Costco-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, is forecast to show a 1% increase in January comps.Regional discount chain operator Stein Mart (SMRT) is expected to show a 1.7% increase in January same-store sales.And teen retailer Buckle (BKE) is forecast to see a 4.4% decline in January comps.

1376,GPS,"Retailers the holiday shopping season on a note that was cheerier than expected Thursday as same-store sales results edged past expectations. December sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.8% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 0.5% gain.But the holiday season wasn't a slam dunk for retailers by any stretch. When the dust settles, it likely will turn out to be a mixed bag of winners and losers, while steep discounts and early-in-the-season promotions are expected to place pressure on margins, leading to forecasts for slim fourth-quarter earnings growth for retailers overall.Macy's (M) gave a glimpse into the dark side of holiday 2015 with worrisome news late Wednesday. The department store slashed fourth-quarter EPS guidance and cut its full-year forecast for 2015.Macy's said same-store sales for November and December declined 4.7% from a year earlier, and it announced job cuts and restructuring.""Macy's announcement signals caution for mid-tier department stores and much of specialty apparel retail,"" Perkins told IBD.Despite its setbacks, Macy's shares climbed 2.4% on the stock market today.Results for the 10 retailers in Perkins' index were mostly positive, despite unseasonably warm weather for much of the month, spending pattern shifts, and competition from Amazon (AMZN) and other online players.Why the beat?""Most of the retailers beat relatively low expectations,"" Perkins said. ""Consumers increased online expenditures for apparel more than expected and some retailers had better results from their online businesses. ""Giant warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale (COST) turned in a 1% rise in December same-store sales, ahead of views for a 0.8% gain. But its U.S. same-store sales rose 5%, excluding various negative impacts, short of forecasts for 5.4%, Perkins said.Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) led the pack with a stunning 8% rise in December same-store sales, sailing past views that called for a 3.8% increase.Regional discount chain operator Stein Mart (SMRT) saw a 1.8% rise in December same-store sales, the polar opposite of views predicting a 1.7% decline.Signet Jewelers (SIG) reported 4.9% rise in same-store sales for the eight weeks ended Dec. 26.

1390,GPS,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsLAS VEGAS — People love to pamper their pets with toys, treats — and, now, tech.Exhibitors at the annual CES trade show this week showed off a bunch of tech products for Fido and Fluffy, ranging from pet game consoles to video conferencing systems.Anser Innovation of Burnsville, Minn., showed off PetChatz, a two-way video conferencing system for dogs and cats and their owners. PetChatz is described as a ""greet and treat"" videophone that allows pet owners to interact with their furry loved ones remotely over the Internet.And with the PawCall accessory, a pet can step on a paw-sized button on the floor to initiate a two-way video call with its owner. Stepping on the pad dispenses a treat and sends a text message to the owner that their pet wants to communicate.The wall-mounted PetChatz HD costs $380, and the PawCall accessory costs $100.Lisa Lavin, chief executive of Anser Innovation, said the device is as much for the owner's state of mind as the pets' well-being.""It alleviates separation anxiety and gives pets a little attention during the day,"" Lavin said.A similar product, Petcube, also lets owners see, talk to and play with their pets remotely.""People miss their pets while they're away,"" said Christopher Madeiras, senior vice president of worldwide sales for San Francisco-based Petcube. ""It's a nice break from the day to check in on them.""The $199 Petcube also has a built-in laser pointer for owners to play with their pets.Speaking of games, CleverPet has designed a game console for dogs. The device has blinking lights on paw pads for dogs to press. If the pets successfully follow the pattern, they earn a treat.The $299 device is a memory game that gets more challenging when dogs do well and easier when they can't keep up, said Philip Meier, ""clever product officer"" at San Diego-based CleverPet.But sometimes pets simply will not be confined. For those times when your dog or cat escapes from the yard, Austria-based Tractive, has a solution.Tractive pet wearables have built in GPS and cellular wireless for tracking down your missing pets. The device pairs with a smartphone app.The device costs $129 with a monthly service fee of about $5. A new version of the tracker, Tractive 2, is due out in Q2.

1410,GPS,"Hegemony: In a surprising and most encouraging development, the Obama administration displayed a little spine in recent days in its ongoing objection to China's sovereignty claim around artificial islands in the South China Sea. But then . . .The last 18 months, China has created about 2,000 acres of new land in the Spratly Island archipelago, dumping dredged sand on coral reefs. The U.S. and others, including Australia, objected to the moves and deployed surveillance assets to the area.In October, Obama's latest secretary of defense, Ash Carter, told Congress: ""We will fly, sail and operate wherever international law permits and whenever our operational needs require."" Good, firm U.S. words.Soon after, a guided-missile destroyer, the USS Lassen, was ordered to sail through waters near the islands to back up Carter's vow. Of course, China objected, claiming a territorial and exclusive economic zone.Good, firm U.S. action.Then last week a U.S. B-52 Stratocruiser flew within two miles of the islands. Another good, firm U.S. action to demonstrate nonrecognition of China's claims.Predictably, the Chinese again objected strongly, calling the flight ""a serious military provocation"" that allegedly put its troops on high alert there.So far, so good. But don't forget, this is the administration of a commander in chief who began his tenure with numerous trips abroad apologizing for America's past actions that may have offended others.Additionally, he has issued several swell-sounding threats — over Syrian chemical weapons and Russia's annexation of Crimea — then done nothing effective to back them up.Last Sunday, China claims Foreign Minister Wang Yi phoned his America counterpart, John Kerry, to lecture him about such incidents, saying, ""While the U.S. is seeking Chinese cooperation, it also should respect China's core interests and major concerns.""Guess what happened? Obama's Pentagon threw the Air Force crew under the landing gear. It apologized to China for the B-52 flight. Seriously.The Pentagon's sad story is that bad weather caused the giant bomber to drift off-course. Uh-huh. True, those eight-engine, strategic workhorses cover almost 10 miles a minute. But weather doesn't affect GPS.B-52s can deliver a standard or nuclear weapon to a specific city block anywhere in the world. And each has one crew member dedicated to position-monitoring.So even with oblivious Obama off golfing again in Hawaii, his minions apologized unnecessarily to a strategic competitor for doing what we said we'd do to oppose China's unlawful territorial claims.Weak, feckless U.S. actions.

1411,GPS,"Spending heated up in March as warmer weather encouraged consumers to come outside and hit the stores, sparking the biggest gain in retail sales in 18 months. The Commerce Department Monday reported that March's seasonally-adjusted retail sales rose 1.1% month-to-month, as shoppers spent more freely on products such as cars, furniture, clothing and general merchandise. That was the strongest month-to-month…
"
1412,GPS,"Retail sales grew at the fastest pace in 18 months during March, suggesting that consumers and the economy may be finally emerging from winter hibernation.
"
1413,GPS,"Sales rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said, more than the 0.7% expected. It was the strongest month-to-month gain since September 2012.
"
1414,GPS,"Auto sales, which rose 3.1%, helped propel sales overall. But even with auto sales stripped out, the resulting 0.7% increase was the best since February 2013. Most sectors saw a rise, and February data were revised up strongly.
"
1415,GPS,"Retail sales figures can be volatile from month to month but have been trending higher the past few years. Economists watch the data closely, as consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the economy.
"
1416,GPS,"Other recent economic data offer convincing reasons for the March bump. Aggregate wages rose 0.7%, the Labor Department said earlier in the month. Gasoline prices fell, said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, giving consumers a little extra discretionary money. Stocks and home values both rose, contributing to a wealth effect, he says.
"
1417,GPS,"""This is real consumer spending, real demand,"" Hoffman said.
"
1418,GPS,"Debating Winter's Impact
"
1419,GPS,"After two months of harsh winter weather, says National Retail Federation chief economist Jack Kleinhenz, those consumers were releasing some pent-up demand when they went shopping in March.
"
1420,GPS,"""Improving economic conditions and consumer confidence should push consumers to return to spending habits this spring,"" he said in a statement. ""We remain optimistic that retail sales will continue their positive march this spring.""
"
1421,GPS,"With the winter in the rearview mirror, a combination of factors bode well for the economy in 2014. Hoffman thinks the second quarter will compensate for the weakness in the first, and the second half will mark a ""break out of the 2% zone that we've been in for years.""
"
1422,GPS,"Some economists disagree on how much the weather has impacted the economy. Hoffman thinks that weather as an explanation for sluggish activity in January and February ""hits the nail on the head"" and that the thaw in March proves it.
"
1423,GPS,"Jeffrey Rosen, chief economist for Briefing.com, is more skeptical. Internet sales — a category that the weather is not likely to influence — rose 1.7% on the month in March, he noted. ""I've always been in the camp that says winter was overblown,"" Rosen said.
"
1424,GPS,"Rosen thinks that wage growth accounts for most of the sales gains. The length of the workweek and hours worked rose, the latter to a multiyear high. It means that businesses will need to step up hiring and boost hours and wages more than they have in the past few years. 
"
1425,GPS,"""We've had low growth and businesses at record high profits, suggesting they can run lean,"" he said. ""But in the end, consumers can only buy if they have income growth.""
"
1426,GPS,"But other economists believe that sluggishness in the winter will result in pent-up demand being pushed forward into 2014.
"
1427,GPS,"Sal Guatieri, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients that the March data bring expectations of spending growth from a 2.0% gain in Q1 to ""a complete recovery"" in Q2, setting up an annualized 3 1/2% increase in 2014. That will help boost GDP, Guatieri noted.
"
1428,GPS,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that the rosy March data were received with relief. ""It's a story we all hoped would be in the numbers,"" he said.
"
1429,GPS,"""We knew that weather depressed January and held back February, and we were looking for that rebound in last week's chain-store sales numbers. But the weak weather-induced chain-store sales numbers didn't make the case as strongly and as convincingly as the retail sales did today.""
"
1430,GPS,"He says the Commerce Department report showed nice gains in retail sales in several store categories, such as general merchandise, clothing and building materials.
"
1431,GPS,"Sales at general-merchandise stores, which include giants such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), increased 1.9%, while building-materials and garden-supply stores, such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), rose 1.8%.
"
1432,GPS,"Another housing-related category, home-furnishings stores, posted a 1% gain. It was likely good news for retailers such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Restoration Hardware Holdings (RH) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).
"
1433,GPS,"Sales at clothing and accessories stores, which include giant apparel retailer Gap (GPS) and women's clothier Ann (ANN), rose 1% in pent-up demand from the prior two months.
"
1434,GPS,"The Discount Dilemma
"
1435,GPS,"Two big-ticket consumer questions remain. Auto sales bounced back nicely in March, to an annualized 16.4 million pace, the fastest in more than seven years. But automakers had to offer deep discounts to entice consumers in March. Still, most economists think that while the pace will ease a bit, it will stay strong, since the average age of cars on the road remains high. Hoffman expects sales of 16 million in 2014.
"
1436,GPS,"The housing market is another question. Rosen said that the combination of higher interest rates and higher home prices is ""concerning"" in its impact on demand. Declining sales mean less demand for construction and less price appreciation for current homeowners. It also hits retail sales, since homebuying tends to lead to increased demand for home furnishings, building materials and electronics.
"
1437,GPS,"Still, the March pop in retail spending jibes with other brightening economic data. Consumer sentiment rose to a nine-month high last week. Producer prices also rose faster than expected in March, a positive sign of more demand in the economy.
"
1438,GPS,"Even mortgage-purchase applications rose 3.0% in the week ended April 4, the third straight week of gains and a possible sign that winter's grip on the housing market may be easing. Homebuying is ""the most weather-sensitive of all,"" Hoffman said. ""I think we'll see a pretty good rebound in homebuilding and homebuying, and that would be the icing on the cake,"" he added.Retail sales grew at the fastest pace in 18 months during March, suggesting that consumers and the economy may be finally emerging from winter hibernation.Sales rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said, more than the 0.7% expected.

The Dow Jones industrial average carved out a 0.7% decline and the S&P 500 fell 0.5%.Trade was mixed, up 13% on the Nasdaq and 5% lower on the NYSE, compared with action at the same time ThursdayThe stock market today felt some early drag from company reports compounded by a raft of weaker-than-forecast producer price and retail sales data.Business inventories expanded 0.3%, the Commerce Department said, vs. consensus views for no change.Consumer sentiment offered a bright spot, with the University of Michigan's November Consumer Sentiment Index jumping to 93.1, up from 90 in September and above views for an improvement to 92. It was the index's best reading since July.In stocks, a number of heavy premarket moves held through to the regular session:Generic-drug maker Mylan (MYL) surged 8% and Perrigo (PRGO) slumped 8% after Mylan failed in its attempted hostile $26 billion takeover of Michigan-based Perrigo. The Wall Street Journal reported Mylan's cash-for-stock tender offer garnered only 40% of Perrigo shares. Mylan needed at least 50% for a successful takeover. The offer expired at 8 a.m. Friday.Switzerland-based seed strain and herbicide giant Syngenta (SYT) leapt 7% after a Bloomberg report that the company rejected a $42 billion takeover offer from state-owned China National Chemical Corp. Syngenta refused a $47 billion offer from Monsanto (MON) earlier this year.Retail groups showed nine of the market's 10 worst losses among industries in the first half hour of trade. Fossil Group (FOSL) collapsed 30%, Nordstrom (JWN) crumbled 18% after reporting weak quarterly results late Thursday.Video game retailer GameStop (GME) dropped 12%. Grilled chicken chain El Pollo Loco (LOCO) unraveled 13%.Chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) climbed 4%. The Santa Clara, Cal. outfit reported in line fiscal Q4 results after Thursday's close. But management said during the quarterly conference call that the company could be open to the possibility of a merger. Applied Materials has been climbing off a September low, but remains deep in an eight-month consolidation.Leading stocks opened the session in a lousy mood, with more than four in every five stocks on the IBD 50 list losing ground in early action.China-based TAL Education (XRS) posted the best move in the group, up almost 2% to peck out another new high. The provider of kindergarten through 12th grade after school tutoring services is now nearly 8% past a 38.75 buy point in a cup with handle base.At the low end of the list, Paycom Software (PAYC) lopped off 7%. The Oklahoma City-based provider of online human-capital management programs priced a 4.5 million share offering at 42.50, a 5% discount to Thursday's closing price. The loss dragged shares back below a 41.68 buy point, but left the stock above its 50-day line of support.Follow Alan Elliott on Twitter: @IBD_AElliott and on Facebook

1476,GPS,"Stocks closed mixed to lower on Friday — on what was the slowest trading day of the year…but did you really expect anything different?  With the US mkts only open for 3 ½ hrs and no real catalyst to push it higher - it would have been hard for it to do anything other than what it did.All the hype over Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday continue to cause a bit of concern as investors/traders began to wonder aloud — what it all means. Will the news on Saturday morning suggest that Black Friday was a dud?  Have all the ‘pre-Black Friday sales’ taken the luster off?  Are retailers sending the signal that they are nervous and if they are, then how will that translate to traders/investors on Monday morning? Well — in a bit of 'forewarning' consumer discretionary and retailers led the way lower on Friday.  Wal-Mart  (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), Tiffany's (TIF), GAP (GPS), JC Penny  (JCP), Macy's (M),Best Buy  (BBY) etc…..all putting in weak performances ahead of the big shopping weekend as traders placed their bets.On Saturday morning — the papers announced the news — No, not the fights to get into the stores, or the lines of people who camped out just to be first in line,  but rather :  'Black Friday — Not so Black', 'Black Friday Sales Slip from Year Prior', 'Black Friday Store Sales Fall as Americans Buy More Online' and 'Black Friday Was a Bust!' SunTrust Robinson Humphrey summed it up by saying:  ""We believe that Thanksgiving shopping was a bust""…. but is that really what happened?  Is it just that the shopping moved from physical to virtual?  Consumers no longer feeling the need to get up and go out.....but rather sit home in their 'skivvies', open up their computers and shop online...spending some $4.4 bil online over the weekend.......in fact this morning's WSJ lays it out clearly: ""Online Shopping Surges on Black Friday Weekend - online shopping, especially via mobile phones, surges, showing how buying habits have changed"" What a contrast to years past? I mean who remembers the look of terrorized sales clerks as throngs of crazed, almost hysterical,  shoppers pushed their way into the stores at midnight? So what’s the consensus? Seems to me that it was a lot of wasted time and talk about Black Friday..... and since all of these 'sales' were happening 'online' as well as in the store in the week's prior to Black Friday and will surely happen in the weeks following Black Friday — why then should anyone rush out and shop on Black Friday?  What is the advantage?  Apparently Zero! The question then becomes - What happens to the margins?  Yes - we are told that sales rose 14%  y/y but at what cost?   Will retailers crush margins in order to entice the consumer to part with their dollars?  And then what does that really mean for the investment thesis?  Is that Bullish?  What is important to remember though — is that the shopping season is not made up of any one day…..it is the culmination of shopping that takes place from early  October — right thru Christmas and then it is the shopping that takes place on Christmas day thru year end when retailers slash the prices of anything that remains to get it 'off the shelf'.  So before anyone goes and makes an investment decision based on Black Friday — remember — Black Friday was a day created by the industry to create hype and excitement — in the end — the results will be what they are…..I am just not sure it will be what the retailers want them to be - but we shall see.OK — back to the mkts…on Friday we saw China get slammed (again) — down some +5% as concern over the slide in industrial profits once again takes center stage causing some analysts to ring the alarm about a deteriorating Chinese economy.  Add in the newly announced probe into some of China's largest brokerages and you had the perfect backdrop for investors to hit the SELL button.   This morning we saw a repeat of that story.... Asian mkts continued to come under pressure overnight as this story builds....   At one point China was off another 3.5% in early trading only to recoup those losses and end the day marginally higher.  The volatility in the Chinese mkts illustrates the difficulty that Chinese officials face as they try to transform their economy and allow the mkts to price in real risk as the gov't attempts to withdraw support.    Japan -0.69%,  Hong Kong -0.33%,  China +0.26%  and ASX -0.69%.In Europe this morning we are seeing those mkts flat to slightly higher as investors there discount the negative moves out of Asia and begin the week anticipating more stimulus to be announced by the ECB on Thursday. The  Eurostoxx index - an index of 50 blue chip stocks that represent the 'super sector' leaders from 12  Eurozone countries -  is up 2% this month and it is up 17%  off  the September lows as optimism builds over the strength of the Eurozone economy as well as the potential for more Kool Aid offered up by the ECB.  ECB Pres Draghi is expected to announce even more stimulus by pushing the cost of parking money at the ECB even higher ( rates to go further into NEGATIVE territory) as he tries to force the banks to lend vs. hoard. FTSE -0.04%, CAC 40 +0.67%, DAX  +0.97%, Eurostoxx  +0.76%, Spain +0.98% and Italy +0.62%.  Now US futures have been all over the place, down nearly 9 pts in early pre-mkt trading and have now swung back to positive territory - currently up  3 pts at 2093 -  as traders/investors return from the long holiday weekend. Get ready for 'macro data overload' as US investors/traders get hit with a slew of data.In addition  we will hear from Fed Chair Yellen as she addresses the Economic Club of Washington on Wednesday and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on Thursday -  Expect traders to listen intently to what she has to say. What does that mean for rates? By now — everyone should realize that it is NOT about the December 16/17th meeting any longer — it is now about what happens next year.Will she indicate that further rate hikes are in store in quick succession in the new year? Is she setting up to be more aggressive in the months ahead?   In addition - watch for the  'FED Bus Tour' featuring a range of FED officials as they pontificate over the state of the economy and monetary policy.Tomorrow we will get Chicago's Evans, and Fed Gov Brainard . Wednesday gives us Atlanta's Lockhart and San Fran's Williams. Thursday brings us Cleveland's Loretta Mester and Fed Vice Chair Fischer....and not to be outdone - Friday will play host to Philly's Harker, St. Louis's Bullard and Minneapolis's Kocherlatkota.Now this week brings a ton of macro data: Today brings us Chicago PMI - exp of 54, Dallas Fed Survey of -10  and Pending Home Sales  of 1%. Tomorrow we get Manf PMI of 52.6, Construction Spending of +0.6%, ISM Manf of 50.5. Wednesday - ADP Employment of +190k....But the KICKER is on Friday when we get the final NFP report before the next FED meeting — expectations are for +200k jobs to be created — which would be down significantly from last month — but strong enough for her to say:  ""And we’re OFF!""(We would have to see a number sub 100k for there to be any concern that she will go into another holding pattern - not happening....)Stay tuned - it is sure to be a week of volatility and excitement.

1477,GPS," No. 1 online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) drew more than a third of Americans' Black Friday and Cyber Monday e-commerce spending by one estimate, while a Wednesday tally called Cyber Monday the heaviest U.S. online spending day in history.Amazon, however, actually appears to have lost a little Cyber Monday market share.Official numbers aren't in from Amazon yet on holiday sales, but by analytics firm Slice Intelligence's tally, Amazon accounted for 35.7% of e-commerce spending on Black Friday, Nov. 27, followed by Best Buy (BBY) with 8.2%, Macy's (M) with 3.4%, and Wal-Mart (WMT) at 3.3%.Amazon's Black Friday share was way up from 31.5% last year in the tally, and Slice estimated that Amazon Black Friday sales rose 23.2% from a year ago.Slice spokeswoman Jaimee Minney told IBD that Cyber Monday ""was bigger than Black Friday and bigger than Cyber Monday last year.""The Black Friday estimate comes primarily from an analysis of about 876,000 email receipts provided by Slice's panel of 3 million shoppers.Amazon garnered a 36.1% share of U.S. e-commerce sales on Cyber Monday by Slice's estimate, down 2.7 percentage points from a year earlier.Also by its estimate, ""the retailer's sales were down 1.3% vs. the same day last year,"" Minney said in an email.Wal-Mart was the only store in the top five to gain share on Cyber Monday by that tally — up half a percentage point, to 3.8%.Cyber Monday SoarsWednesday, online tracker comScore said Cyber Monday reached $3.12 billion in online spending, up 21% from last year's Cyber Monday.ComScore's mobile figures aren't final, but it said desktop online spending set a record, at $2.28 billion.ComScore said that for the first 30 days of the holiday season, $27.9 billion has been spent online by desktops, up 6% from a year ago.""The weekend after Thanksgiving also reached a major milestone as it saw its first ever billion-dollar online shopping day on Sunday,"" it said in a report Wednesday, ""while Saturday sales reached the $1 billion mark for a second year in a row.""Overall, Cyber Monday online sales set a record with $3.07 billion in spending across the U.S., up 16% from last year, according to Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Index, as Amazon leveraged its e-commerce dominance. But Thanksgiving weekend sales looked weak at brick-and-mortar retailers.Apple (AAPL) iPad and iPhone doorbusters were hits for Target (TGT) and others, while Wal-Mart announced booming mobile sales.Retail analytics provider ShopperTrak, however, estimates that U.S. physical stores took in 10.4% less than a year earlier over Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the weekend — an estimated $20.4 billion that does not include Cyber Monday.Amazon's Black Friday showing wouldn't be out of line with the IBD Leaderboard company's heft in online shopping — the company ""makes up about 69% of total U.S. retail traffic,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said in a research report this week. Minney said Amazon's Black Friday crowd ""doesn't surprise us.""Amazon said that it had a record Thanksgiving weekend for selling Amazon devices, triple last year's result. Its top-selling products across all those available on Amazon.com on Black Friday were Amazon devices, the company said — No. 1 was Fire (its tablet line), and No. 2 was the Fire TV stick for streaming video online.Where People Shop OnlineIn October, the latest month tallied, Amazon drew over 160 million online visitors, up 19% from a year ago according to comScore (SCOR) and Canaccord estimates. Next-up eBay (EBAY) drew about 88 million (up 12%), Wal-Mart 84 million (up 32%) and Target almost 69 million (up 15%).Amazon's rise was ""meaningfully fast,"" Canaccord analyst Graham said in a research note Tuesday.Graham noted that Amazon stock is the best-performing name in his coverage area and has more than doubled this year.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.RELATED VIDEO:Shopping Surges Online: What's Hot, What Flopped?

1493,GPS,"The terrorist attack in Paris this month that left at least 130 dead is igniting more debate on the already hot-button issue of encryption. A legislative fistfight in the U.K. over Internet surveillance could buoy similar measures in the U.S., where law enforcement has long clamored for access to Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) -owned Google encrypted communications, an analyst told IBD.U.S. counterterrorism officials renewed calls for backdoor access this week in the wake of the Nov. 13 massacre in Paris. The Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility, saying it was the ""first of the storm.""But law enforcement will face a bitter battle from Silicon Valley and privacy advocates who have overwhelmingly launched staunch opposition to any legislation that would mandate that companies decrypt customers' information.They'll have to do so without support from the overall Obama administration which, in October, retreated from FBI-backed calls for government access. FBI Director James Comey is seemingly leading the charge amid worries that ISIS is using encrypted communications to avoid detection.All Eyes On The U.K.U.S. lawmakers appear unwilling to support backdoor access to locked communications, FBR analyst Daniel Ives told IBD. Still, the eyes of Washington are now on the U.K., where the Investigatory Powers Bill is under heated debate.The Paris attacks ""changed the game,"" Ives said. Although French authorities haven't said whether encrypted communications were used to organize the attacks, it seems likely, Ives said. An abandoned cell phone helped French police track down the alleged ringleader.""But this is a much broader issue,"" he said, ""because a lot of malicious actors over the last year have communicated through encryption, and it's really created a lot of challenges for law enforcement.""The U.K. bill, introduced in May, has made it further than any U.S. cybersecurity bill and could signal changing attitudes on the encryption issue, he said. In the U.S., however, similar bills emphasize ""voluntary information sharing"" between private enterprise and the federal government.Last month, the Senate passed the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, 74-21. In April, the House passed the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015 by a vote of 355-63.""The differences between the bills will need to be reconciled before going to the White House,"" Ives said. ""We do not expect the bills to be reopened or expanded in the wake of the Paris attacks.""Opposition on Capitol Hill — and within private and public ranks — include ""privacy advocates who are ideologically opposed to any bill compromising encryption, and those who are concerned that backdoors would be exploited by hackers,"" Ives said.The 408 BlockBasically, ""if you have a 408 area code, you're against (decryption legislation),"" Ives said. ""Any tech firm in Silicon Valley is against this, just as part of the solidarity.""Apple CEO Tim Cook lands squarely in the opposition block. In September 2014, Cook wrote that Apple wouldn't share its data with any government.""I want to be absolutely clear that we have never worked with any government agency from another country to create a backdoor in any of our products and services,"" he wrote on Apple's website. ""We have also never allowed access to our servers. And we never will.""To that point, Apple doesn't have access to encryption keys, which are stored locally on each smartphone. Touch ID scans a user's fingerprint and then tokenizes it, according to Apple's Privacy page. That token is then stored within the device.Apple declined to comment for the story.It's a common standard, Proofpoint (PFPT) CEO Gary Steele told IBD. Proofpoint, a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based cybersecurity firm, encrypts data in two ways — encrypted email and a cloud-based email archival system.""We give the encryption key to the customer,"" he said, explaining that the key is stored within a box inside the cloud. ""We don't stand in the way of the customer's privacy.""Could Proofpoint give the government access to a customer's data?""We couldn't,"" Steele said. ""We would prefer to see law enforcement work with the customer because it's their data, their information and their employees.""Fallout In Snowden's WakeEdward Snowden's 2013 release of thousands of classified documents revealing NSA surveillance programs still weighs heavy on American thought, Ives said. He estimates that there's a $30 billion, three-year encryption market opportunity.The number of encrypted applications has also skyrocketed since, Check Point Software (CHKP) researcher Shahar Tal told IBD. That's why legislation forcing decryption in cooperation with law enforcement is relatively fruitless, he said.""People who want to encrypt, no one will ever be able to stop them,"" he said. ""The fact that Apple is doing it and putting encryption in the device is something that's helping every(body) do that without effort. But, anyone who wants to properly encrypt, can properly encrypt.""ISIS proved as much last December. An eight-minute video circulated to members discusses surveillance techniques of hostile governments and how phones can be tracked, according to the Wall Street Journal.In January, an online follower ranked 33 encryption applications. Signal, RedPhone, Wickr and Telegram Messenger topped the list, according to Computer World . ISIS has since moved official communications to Telegram Messenger from Twitter (TWTR).Apple devices, on the other hand, were deemed ""dangerous"" and banned among Islamic State members, according to tech site Arab Crunch .Smartphone Firms Draw The LineStill, law enforcement isn't letting up on Apple and Google, and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance recently noted that 111 cases handled by his office were hampered by encrypted devices.""The line to protect the public should not be drawn by two companies who make smartphones,"" he said, according to Bloomberg.But Vance isn't calling for backdoor access per se — rather he's asking that companies download encrypted data for investigators with a warrant.On Nov. 18, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, National District Attorneys Association President William Fitzpatrick, FBI Agents Association President Reynaldo Tariche and National Sheriffs' Association CEO Jonathan Thompson joined Vance in calling for Apple and Google to cooperate with law enforcement.The letter addressed Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and outlined ""deep concern with the new encryption software installed on Apple and Android cell phones."" Google representatives didn't return an email requesting comment.""Even with a valid search warrant, the current encryption measures utilized in your phones make it impossible to access evidence of a crime,"" they wrote. ""Without law enforcement access to this vital information, you have created a safe harbor for criminals where they may operate freely.""They relied heavily on the 2012 Steubenville High School rape case to underscore their point. In August 2012, an intoxicated 16-year-old West Virginia girl was repeatedly raped by two of the Ohio high school's football players and sexually assaulted by others. The crimes were later documented on social media.Ohio investigators seized more than a dozen cell phones during the investigation. The analysts uncovered ""hundreds of incriminating text messages and pictures,"" according to the letter.""But for the evidence recovered from personal cell phones, that high school girl and her family would likely never have seen justice served,"" they wrote.'Mandating Insecurity'Exceptional access by law enforcement would ""introduce unanticipated, hard-to-detect security flaws,"" a coalition of MIT researchers wrote in July. Essentially, where there's a hole in security, there's a potential exploit — and hackers will find it.They likened it to ""mandating insecurity.""""We believe that law enforcement has failed to account for the risks inherent in exceptional access systems,"" the researchers wrote. ""Based on our considerable expertise in real-world applications, we know that such risks lurk in the technical details.""Such access would force a ""U-turn"" in best security practices and substantially increase complexity in an already complicated, delicate system. Agencies holding those backdoor keys would be especially vulnerable to attacks, they wrote.""If law enforcement's keys guaranteed access to everything, an attacker who gained access to those keys would enjoy the same privilege,"" they wrote.Georgia Institute of Technology law and ethics professor Peter Swire testified in July before the Committee on the Judiciary, noting that law enforcement already has the tools it needs for effective surveillance.""We are currently in the golden age of surveillance,"" he wrote in a July editorial on Slate.com. ""The 'going dark' argument should not be used as a reason to support backdoors or other special access by law enforcement to encrypted communications.""Over the past 20 years, smartphone innovations have allowed law enforcement to track suspects through GPS and compile lengthy dossiers on their contacts and digital lives, he wrote. Text messages, too, are often available via the network provider.Like the MIT researchers, he noted the inherent vulnerabilities within backdoors.""The inability to access the content of a small fraction of these communications does not warrant the subsequent damage that would result to privacy and to the U.S. economic, diplomatic and security interests,"" he wrote.

1542,GPS,"No one could accuse Donald Fisher of thinking small.
"
1543,GPS,"In 1969, the San Francisco real-estate developer went from one department store to the other, trying to find jeans that fit his lanky body.
"
1544,GPS,"Instead of finding jeans, he came up with an idea that would reshape the retail and fashion industries.
"
1545,GPS,"At the time, department stores carried only the most common Levi's sizes and a narrow selection of styles. After raising $63,000, Fisher and his wife, Doris, opened a funky shop in San Francisco where customers could buy every size, cut and style of Levi's.
"
1546,GPS,"They called it Gap, designed to appeal to counterculture teens alienated by the generation gap.
"
1547,GPS,"Although he was 41 at the time and had no retail experience, Fisher turned that first store into a 3,100-store casual-wear empire and a brand name recognized around the world.
"
1548,GPS,"More Names
"
1549,GPS,"By the time he stepped down as chief executive in 1995, Gap (GPS) was synonymous with casual American style and specialty retailing, operating three of the most recognized global brands — Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy.
"
1550,GPS,"""Before the Gap, people went to local boutiques and department stores,"" Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD Group, told IBD. ""By taking a specialty store, replicated it into a national chain, then taking it worldwide, he (played a key role) in making the mall what it is today. He was a pioneer. He carved a path that others followed.""
"
1551,GPS,"Fisher said in his autobiography, ""Falling Into the Gap: The Story of Donald Fisher and the Apparel Icon He Created"": ""I just wanted to take the nightmare out of buying Levi's, to offer an easy and well-organized shopping experience that would appeal to a guy like me.""
"
1552,GPS,"Fisher (1928-2009) was the oldest of three boys in a San Francisco family. He was an average student, but a star athlete, beating teenage swimmers as an 8-year-old.
"
1553,GPS,"""I soon found I hated to lose more than I loved to win,"" he wrote. ""As I competed in the pool, and later in business, that attitude would become ingrained — a guiding principle.''
"
1554,GPS,"At the University of California, Berkeley, Fisher was captain of both the swimming and water polo teams. After graduating with a degree in business administration in 1951, he went to work in his parents' cabinet business.
"
1555,GPS,"Two years later, Fisher married Doris Feigenbaum, one of the first women to earn an economics degree from Stanford University, and they would have three sons.
"
1556,GPS,"In short order he quit the family business and started building spec homes and converting old hotels into businesses and residences.
"
1557,GPS,"""I couldn't stand working for my father any longer,"" he wrote. ""I was on the brink of seeing him as my enemy and had to be my own man.""
"
1558,GPS,"In the late 1960s, while leasing hotel space to a Levi's salesman, Fisher bought a pair of jeans that were an inch too short. The salesman said he couldn't exchange the jeans, so Fisher searched at department stores for a pair that fit him.
"
1559,GPS,"""They carried only even sizes, about five pair in each size category: 34 x 32, 36 x 32 and so on,"" he wrote. ""What if someone put together all the styles, colors and sizes Levi Strauss had to offer in one store?""
"
1560,GPS,"Mapping It Out
"
1561,GPS,"Having spotted a potential gap in the market, Fisher drew up a seven-page business plan in June 1969.
"
1562,GPS,"He then leased a space near a high school and two colleges on San Francisco's Ocean Avenue and in two months was open for business.
"
1563,GPS,"The original Gap sold records and tapes along with jeans of every cut, size and style neatly arranged in wooden cubbyholes.
"
1564,GPS,"""I viewed things with the eyes of a real estate man, not a retailer,"" wrote Fisher. ""I always looked for ways to get the most out of square footage, to go beyond the floor space. So I created a honeycomb of cubicles on the walls. ... I had never seen this done before, but it seemed so logical, I wondered, why not?""
"
1565,GPS,"By appealing to teens, he tapped into a market that was about to reshape American fashion.
"
1566,GPS,"""They didn't want to shop with the establishment,"" Cohen said. ""It was about building a place where (young people) could feel was their own. The music was different, the atmosphere was different. It wasn't about pressure.''
"
1567,GPS,"Business boomed right away. A year later, Gap had three stores, including one in San Jose.
"
1568,GPS,"In 1974, the Fishers launched the Gap label.
"
1569,GPS,"The Boom
"
1570,GPS,"By 1979, Gap was bulging with 400 stores countrywide, most of them in malls.
"
1571,GPS,"Four years later the number was 500, with annual sales topping $480 million.
"
1572,GPS,"Yet Don Fisher was frustrated. He wasn't proud of the company's discounted merchandise; he wanted something more upscale. ""Discounting brought us lots of dollars, but no joy,"" he wrote.
"
1573,GPS,"In 1983, aiming for a classier product, Don hired Mickey Drexler, a charismatic New York City retailer who had overhauled the Ann Taylor brand.
"
1574,GPS,"""Betting the company on Mickey was easily the biggest gamble I'd ever taken in my life,"" Fisher wrote. ""But I had no choice. It was my vision as well as his, and without risk, there's no gain. This gamble was worth it.""
"
1575,GPS,"Drexler convinced Fisher to reinvent Gap, focusing on classy basics such as khakis, white T-shirts and jeans. In 1983 they bought Banana Republic, a small safari and travel clothing company. Eleven years later they created Old Navy, the first retailer in history to reach $1 billion in sales in less than four years, according to Gap.com.
"
1576,GPS,"Gap was about mass fashion, not high fashion. With children's offshoots GapKids and babyGap as well as Old Navy and Banana Republic, Gap stores seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s.
"
1577,GPS,"""It was the convenience store of fashion. That's how big it got,"" Cohen said.
"
1578,GPS,"By creating affordable, stylish casual clothes, Fisher influenced the nation's lifestyle as well the economy. The acceptance of informal apparel helped lead to the adoption of casual Fridays, says Cohen.

1585,GPS,"It all came down to Don Fisher deciding to change careers 44 years ago when he couldn't find a pair of Levi's jeans with a 31-inch inseam.
"
1586,GPS,"""Don and Doris took a simple idea and turned it into a brand recognized as a cultural icon throughout the world and changed the face of retail forever,"" Glenn Murphy, Gap's current CEO, said following Fisher's death.No one could accuse Donald Fisher of thinking small.In 1969, the San Francisco real-estate developer went from one department store to the other, trying to find jeans that fit his lanky body.Instead of finding jeans, he came up with an idea that would reshape the retail and fashion industries.At the time, department stores carried only the most common Levi's sizes and a narrow selection of styles. After raising $63,000, Fisher and his wife, Doris, opened a funky shop in San Francisco where customers could buy every size, cut and style of Levi's.They called it Gap, designed to appeal to counterculture teens alienated by the generation gap.Although he was 41 at the time and had no retail experience, Fisher turned that first store into a 3,100-store casual-wear empire and a brand name recognized around the world.More NamesBy the time he stepped down as chief executive in 1995, Gap (GPS) was synonymous with casual American style and specialty retailing, operating three of the most recognized global brands — Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy.""Before the Gap, people went to local boutiques and department stores,"" Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD Group, told IBD. ""By taking a specialty store, replicated it into a national chain, then taking it worldwide, he (played a key role) in making the mall what it is today. He was a pioneer. He carved a path that others followed.""Fisher said in his autobiography, ""Falling Into the Gap: The Story of Donald Fisher and the Apparel Icon He Created"": ""I just wanted to take the nightmare out of buying Levi's, to offer an easy and well-organized shopping experience that would appeal to a guy like me.""Fisher (1928-2009) was the oldest of three boys in a San Francisco family. He was an average student, but a star athlete, beating teenage swimmers as an 8-year-old.""I soon found I hated to lose more than I loved to win,"" he wrote. ""As I competed in the pool, and later in business, that attitude would become ingrained — a guiding principle.''At the University of California, Berkeley, Fisher was captain of both the swimming and water polo teams. After graduating with a degree in business administration in 1951, he went to work in his parents' cabinet business.Two years later, Fisher married Doris Feigenbaum, one of the first women to earn an economics degree from Stanford University, and they would have three sons.In short order he quit the family business and started building spec homes and converting old hotels into businesses and residences.""I couldn't stand working for my father any longer,"" he wrote. ""I was on the brink of seeing him as my enemy and had to be my own man.""In the late 1960s, while leasing hotel space to a Levi's salesman, Fisher bought a pair of jeans that were an inch too short. The salesman said he couldn't exchange the jeans, so Fisher searched at department stores for a pair that fit him.""They carried only even sizes, about five pair in each size category: 34 x 32, 36 x 32 and so on,"" he wrote. ""What if someone put together all the styles, colors and sizes Levi Strauss had to offer in one store?""Mapping It OutHaving spotted a potential gap in the market, Fisher drew up a seven-page business plan in June 1969.He then leased a space near a high school and two colleges on San Francisco's Ocean Avenue and in two months was open for business.The original Gap sold records and tapes along with jeans of every cut, size and style neatly arranged in wooden cubbyholes.""I viewed things with the eyes of a real estate man, not a retailer,"" wrote Fisher. ""I always looked for ways to get the most out of square footage, to go beyond the floor space. So I created a honeycomb of cubicles on the walls. ... I had never seen this done before, but it seemed so logical, I wondered, why not?""By appealing to teens, he tapped into a market that was about to reshape American fashion.""They didn't want to shop with the establishment,"" Cohen said. ""It was about building a place where (young people) could feel was their own. The music was different, the atmosphere was different. It wasn't about pressure.''Business boomed right away. A year later, Gap had three stores, including one in San Jose.In 1974, the Fishers launched the Gap label.The BoomBy 1979, Gap was bulging with 400 stores countrywide, most of them in malls.Four years later the number was 500, with annual sales topping $480 million.Yet Don Fisher was frustrated. He wasn't proud of the company's discounted merchandise; he wanted something more upscale. ""Discounting brought us lots of dollars, but no joy,"" he wrote.In 1983, aiming for a classier product, Don hired Mickey Drexler, a charismatic New York City retailer who had overhauled the Ann Taylor brand.""Betting the company on Mickey was easily the biggest gamble I'd ever taken in my life,"" Fisher wrote. ""But I had no choice. It was my vision as well as his, and without risk, there's no gain. This gamble was worth it.""Drexler convinced Fisher to reinvent Gap, focusing on classy basics such as khakis, white T-shirts and jeans. In 1983 they bought Banana Republic, a small safari and travel clothing company. Eleven years later they created Old Navy, the first retailer in history to reach $1 billion in sales in less than four years, according to Gap.com.Gap was about mass fashion, not high fashion. With children's offshoots GapKids and babyGap as well as Old Navy and Banana Republic, Gap stores seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s.""It was the convenience store of fashion. That's how big it got,"" Cohen said.By creating affordable, stylish casual clothes, Fisher influenced the nation's lifestyle as well the economy. The acceptance of informal apparel helped lead to the adoption of casual Fridays, says Cohen.Gap was so hot in 1993 that TV's ""Saturday Night Live"" satirized the company with a skit featuring Adam Sandler and Chris Farley.

1598,GPS,"Amazon.com could face a backlash for hiking the annual membership fee on its Amazon Prime service to $99 from $79, a survey shows.The higher cost might nudge some shoppers to drop their Prime memberships and buy fewer items on Amazon (AMZN), according to findings from the survey by research firm Bizrate Insights.The increase comes at a time when complaints are surfacing about prices charged for some third-party goods sold on Amazon.com and as some consumers have become irked that Amazon now collects state sales taxes. (See related story, this page.)""Everybody knows online shoppers are price sensitive,"" Hayley Silver, a vice president with Bizrate, told IBD.The unit of online-retail site Shopzilla found in a recent survey that only 43% of Prime members definitely plan to renew their membership at the $99 price. Only 15%, however, said they would not renew. The rest were undecided.Silver says the results show that price is a factor even for a familiar and trusted name like Amazon.Bizrate polled 4,200 online buyers in March after Amazon announced its higher Prime fee. It was the first increase since Amazon launched the popular service nine years ago. Prime includes free two-day shipping on all orders, video streaming and e-book borrowing.Big EPS Boost SeenThe increase defrays more of the program's shipping expenses and bolsters Amazon's bottom line.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates in a March 13 research note that the increase will generate $300 million to $400 million in annual operating income, leading to a 45-cent to 55-cent increase in earnings per share. Amazon posted EPS of just 59 cents last year, as it continues to spend heavily to expand its warehouses and other operations.But some analysts fear that the rising Prime fee, if it deters renewals and new signups, could further slow revenue growth, which has fallen from 41% in 2011 to 27% in 2012 and 22% in 2013.Analysts estimate that Amazon has more than 20 million Prime members, though the company has never disclosed that figure.The Bizrate survey found that when shoppers choose between Amazon and another retailer, familiarity with the retailer matters. When the retailer is familiar, lowest total cost is critical to the decision, with the non-Prime customers more price sensitive.Non-Prime members get free shipping from Amazon on orders of $35 and up — Amazon raised it from $25 in October — but delivery is not guaranteed within two days.Forrester Research analyst Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali points to an example of a big, well-liked Internet company facing lots of heat when it raised prices.Online video service Netflix (NFLX), an Amazon rival in the video-streaming market, raised its prices on its DVD and online movie packages in July 2011, only to lose more subscribers than it expected.""If Netflix's (past increases) are any sign, then people don't like price hikes of any sort,"" said Mulpuru-Kodali.Video, Lending HelpThe Bizrate poll found that those who intend to renew Prime at the $99 value especially like the fact that it includes Amazon's video-streaming service, called Instant Video, and the Kindle Lending Library, Amazon's program that lets its Kindle users borrow e-books.An upbeat factor for Amazon is that those who intend to renew Prime at the $99 rate placed more Amazon orders in the past year than the others, based on the poll's results.Bizrate says Amazon can do four things to boost Prime renewals:1. Make more products available under Prime,2. Add more, and better, shows to its Instant Video service,3. Increase the number of e-books available in the Kindle Lending Library program, and4. Offer some exclusive discounts for Prime members.Amazon's rivals don't have the e-commerce leader's huge fulfillment centers and vast product selection, nor do many offer the perks that come with Prime.""Amazon is still my 'go to' for online shopping,"" Elena McCoy, a San Francisco area corporate affairs director, told IBD. ""Three reasons: ease of use, a wide variety of choices, and Amazon Prime two-day shipping... . The price increase for Amazon Prime doesn't bother me because it's still an incredible deal.""But some observers contend the higher fee makes alternatives more alluring. It might siphon more sales from Amazon and contribute to its slowing revenue growth.The higher cost narrows Amazon's price advantages. Websites for chain retailers such as WalMart (WMT), The Gap (GPS) and Banana Republic offer free shipping on orders of $50 or more.Websites of these and other retailers are crowded with discounts, and Amazon doesn't always list the lowest total cost.""There is definitely an opportunity for retailers and shop owners to test consumer loyalty programs"" that challenge Amazon, Bizrate's Silver said.Some Amazon rivals are improving their shipping operations. Macy's (M) is using inventory held at its stores to make deliveries for online shoppers nationwide. The chain offers free shipping for online orders of $99 and above. Under an order-fulfillment system launched in 2012, Macy's stores in some regions are getting the capability to serve as product warehouses and ship items that have been ordered online. Macy's hopes to offer same-day delivery in parts of the U.S. eventually.Amazon has long been on the same-day-delivery quest. The company is testing AmazonFresh, a same-day grocery delivery service, on orders of at least $35 in parts of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Some observers say knowledge gained from AmazonFresh will help Amazon eventually implement same-day delivery for many other products.Amazon faces competition. EBay (EBAY) is testing same-day delivery in San Jose, Calif., San Francisco and New York City. Google (GOOG) is testing a Google Shopping Express same-day service in San Francisco.The free shipping tests online sellers, observers say.""Prime is a very expensive program for Amazon, especially the promise that packages arrive within two days,"" said Forrester's Mulpuru-Kodali. ""They had no choice but to raise prices, but even at that, it's still an expensive program. We'll never know the churn rate (for Amazon Prime) because Amazon never shares (that data).""

But 47% said that they use their smartphone, and 43% use a portable navigation device, indicating that many drivers use more than one type of system.""The sharp increase in usage and satisfaction among smartphone-based navigation app users could indicate challenges ahead for OEMs (original equipment manufacturers),"" Strategy Analytics analyst Derek Viita said in a statement.

"
1716,GPS,"The final tally for the month will be released Thursday.Why such a soft forecast?""July auto sales were quite robust,"" Perkins told IBD. ""That, in my estimation, is pulling money away from traditional retailers.""The weather was particularly hot across the country in July, he adds, which likely kept shoppers out of the malls as they headed to the beach and other outdoor venues.Another key factor leading to the softness is that consumers aren't seeing wage gains and are ""cautious with their spending,"" Perkins says.Perkins says the projected soft showing for the month suggests that the back-to-school shopping season is ""going to be a difficult one for most retailers.""The back-to-school shopping season started in late July and runs through mid-September.Costco Wholesale (COST) is projected to see an 0.2% decline in July same-store sales.

1738,GPS,"Dads, grads and America's 239th birthday weren't enough for June to bloom, as retailers had another so-so month with consumers finding other outlets for pocket change.The numbers indicate that consumers are shifting their spending away from traditional retail shops and in favor of shelling out for technology such as smartphones and tablets by Apple (AAPL), Samsung and other makers, as well as dining, entertainment and car purchases.June same-store sales missed forecasts, coming in down 0.2% from a year ago, after a 0.6% year-over-year gain in May and a 0.9% decline in April, according to a tally of 11 chains by The Retail Economist, a Tucson, Ariz.-based economic forecasting firm. Michael Niemira, chief economist there, had in May forecast that June same-store sales would likely rise in the range of 1% to 2%.June's A WallflowerTypically, June acts as a lull between Mother's Day shopping in May and when back-to-school sales ramp up in late July and early August. ""June is sort of a transitionary month,"" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, who called the numbers ""lackluster.""Warm weather and a falling unemployment rate haven't been enough to muster consistent growth in the retailers still providing monthly sales statistics.""The long-term impact that the Great Recession has had has definitely tempered spending,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Wage increases have been very small during the recovery. The retailers are still waiting for the consumer to show up.""One of those retailers, Costco (COST), was hurt by the strong dollar and fallen gasoline prices as its overall June showing of a 1% decline missed the consensus of a 0.1% decline. It was Costco's sixth miss during the past seven months.Gasoline prices have rebounded to a degree since last year's 50% collapse in crude oil prices, but they're still below where prices were a year earlier. Excluding gasoline, the Issaquah, Wash.-based warehouse club notched a 6% gain, ahead of views forecasting a 5.2% gain, indicating Costco's underlying domestic business is strong.Gap's (GPS) same-store sales fell a worse-than-expected 1% in June. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.7%. June sales at its Old Navy unit grew a disappointing 1%, less than the 2.3% consensus. Banana Republic did better than expected, growing sales 1%, vs. the 0.2% decline forecast. Gap's namesake clothing stores saw a 5% year-over-year fall in same-store sales, worse than the 3.9% drop that was predicted.L Brands (LB), the parent company of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, notched a 3% gain compared with a year ago, but just missed views of 3.1%.The clothing on its models wasn't the only scant adornment at Victoria's Secret. Its sales growth was skimpy, notching a 1% gain in June, below a forecast for 3.2%. Bath & Body Works was the stronger performer of the two L Brands units, posting a 6% gain, beating views calling for a 3.8% increase in sales.""Young consumers more interested in what kind of smartphone they have instead of what they're wearing,"" Perkins said.Stein Mart (SMRT), a Jacksonville, Fla.-based discount retailer, was the strongest performer in the Retail Metrics index, posting a 5.8% gain compared with June 2014, doubling estimates of 2.9%.""Overall, we've seen a little bit of sluggishness since the beginning of the year; that's mirrored the broader sluggishness we've seen in the economy,"" said Niemira.Teen clothing retailer Buckle (BKE) edged a 0.5% gain, beating estimates calling for a 1.1% decline.Drugstore chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), highly rated by IBD, jumped more than 4% in the stock market Thursday after an upbeat quarterly report. It noted domestic comparable-store sales growth of 1.6% for the quarter ended in May.Drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) saw a 2.4% increase in June same-store sales, missing views of 2.9%. The Camp Hill, Pa.-based company's sales were powered primarily by its pharmacy unit, which grew by 3.4%, just missing the consensus of 3.5%. Rite Aid's front-end sales rose 0.3% from a year earlier, falling short of forecasts of a 1.8% gain.Specialty clothier Zumiez (ZUMZ) had a 3.3% decline in sales, performing worse than the 3.2% drop that analysts expected.Cato (CATO), a Charlotte, N.C.-based women's fashion retailer, posted no gain in June sales, better than the 1% decline forecast.Fred's (FRED), a discount retailer based in Memphis, Tenn., fell short of views, posting a 1.6% year-over-year gain; analysts expected 1.9%.San Diego-based warehouse club PriceSmart (PSMT) turned in a 4% gain in June comparable sales, beating the forecast for 3%. Its quarterly report after the bell Thursday fell short of expectations, though, and the stock slipped after hours.Home ImprovementsDespite retail being flat for June, consumers have opened their wallets in other areas, such as home improvement. Firms such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) announced in May they had strong Q1 sales.The impact of lower gasoline prices — a problem for Costco's revenue — is being felt as a positive effect in other areas of the U.S. economy, Niemira told IBD.""Anything house-related seems to have picked up,"" he said.
"
1739,GPS,"Mother Nature wreaked havoc on retailers in January as frigid temperatures in much of the U.S. kept mall traffic weak and dampened spending, leading to sluggish sales reports for most chains Thursday even as they touted aggressive discounts.
"
1740,GPS,"But overall sales still came in ahead of the forecasts, led by a strong showing from Costco Wholesale (COST) and L Brands (LB).
"
1741,GPS,"Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.3% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
"
1742,GPS,"Analysts had predicted a modest 2.2% increase. ""The month was not as bad as feared,"" said Perkins. ""But it was still a sluggish month for most retailers.""
"
1743,GPS,"Retailers faced a number of head winds in January.
"
1744,GPS,"""Retailers were very promotional for the month and mall traffic was very sluggish,"" said Perkins. ""Weather was a major factor for many in the Midwest and Northeast.""
"
1745,GPS,"The cold weather, he adds, led to a very ""slow start"" to the early spring selling season, with many consumers ""cooped up"" and not shopping.
"
1746,GPS,"Another head wind was ""negligible"" personal income gains for mid- and lower-income consumers, which kept a ""lid on spending,"" Perkins said. Also, there was a ""dearth"" of fashion during the month.
"
1747,GPS,"Michael Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers, also calculates January same-store sales rose 3.3% vs. a year earlier, which he calls a ""moderate"" showing.
"
1748,GPS,"Weather Dampens Demand
"
1749,GPS,"Overall, the month was ""OK"" and a repeat of December's showing of a 3.4% comps rise, he said.
"
1750,GPS,"""It's overwhelmingly a weather story on top of a low-volume month,"" said Niemira. ""Therefore, I don't read too much into the numbers for the long haul. It certainly had an impact on the month and the quarter. But it doesn't mean there's a fundamental weakness.""
"
1751,GPS,"As the months go by there's often a ""bigger rebound from the exceedingly weak demand we're seeing because of the weather,"" he added. ""We may have to wait until March, but as long as the economy continues to perform well, which is our expectation, I would tend to look beyond the weather.""
"
1752,GPS,"There were some bright spots during the month. Upside surprises from warehouse club giant Costco, Victoria's Secret's parent L Brands, and drugstore chains Walgreen (WAG) and Rite Aid (RAD) accounted for much of the beat, Perkins says.
"
1753,GPS,"Also on the bright side, giant apparel retailer Gap (GPS) posted January comps well ahead of views.
"
1754,GPS,"Costco came in with a solid 4% comp for the total company, ahead of forecasts for a 3.4% gain. Its U.S. same-store sales, excluding the negative impact of gasoline prices, climbed 5%.
"
1755,GPS,"L Brands posted a 9% rise in comps vs. a year earlier, sailing past forecasts for a 0.5% gain.
"
1756,GPS,"L Brands had to discount ""quite a bit"" during the month, as did most apparel retailers, said Perkins. But, he adds, it still came in with a strong comp gain even as it faced a tough comparison with last January's 9% increase in same-store sales.
"
1757,GPS,"""That's impressive, even though they had to take markdowns,"" said Perkins.
"
1758,GPS,"L Brands also raised Q4 earnings guidance, ""something virtually no retailers have done this quarter,"" Perkins said.

"
1773,GPS,"That's due in part to relatively easy comparisons with Q1 2013, says Perkins, when earnings were up only 4.5%.

1775,GPS,"Economic Outlook
"
1776,GPS,"Separately, the National Retail Federation released an upbeat 2014 economic forecast Thursday. The industry trade group forecasts retail industry sales (which exclude automobiles, gas stations, and restaurants) will increase 4.1%, up from the preliminary 3.7% growth seen in 2013. It also announced Thursday it expects online sales in 2014 to grow between 9% and 12%.
"
1777,GPS,"""Measured improvements in economic growth combined with positive expectations for continued consumer spending will put the retail industry in a relatively good place in 2014,"" said CEO Matthew Shay in a statement. ""Though head winds in the form of the looming debt-ceiling debates, increased health care costs, and regulatory concerns still pose risks for both consumers and retailers, we are cautiously optimistic and hopeful that the economic tides will change in 2014.""
"
1778,GPS,"The NRF predicts economic growth will be above its long-term historical average. Early estimates for real GDP growth could fall between 2.6% and 3%, ""a noticeable improvement from the estimated 1.9% rate for 2013 and the fastest pace in the past three years.""

1780,GPS,"The housing sector is expected to continue to improve in 2014, and stronger household and business confidence should spur more consumer spending overall.Mother Nature wreaked havoc on retailers in January as frigid temperatures in much of the U.S. kept mall traffic weak and dampened spending, leading to sluggish sales reports for most chains Thursday even as they touted aggressive discounts.But overall sales still came in ahead of the forecasts, led by a strong showing from Costco Wholesale (COST) and L Brands (LB).Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.3% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.Analysts had predicted a modest 2.2% increase. ""The month was not as bad as feared,"" said Perkins. ""But it was still a sluggish month for most retailers.""Retailers faced a number of head winds in January.""Retailers were very promotional for the month and mall traffic was very sluggish,"" said Perkins. ""Weather was a major factor for many in the Midwest and Northeast.""The cold weather, he adds, led to a very ""slow start"" to the early spring selling season, with many consumers ""cooped up"" and not shopping.Another head wind was ""negligible"" personal income gains for mid- and lower-income consumers, which kept a ""lid on spending,"" Perkins said. Also, there was a ""dearth"" of fashion during the month.Michael Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers, also calculates January same-store sales rose 3.3% vs. a year earlier, which he calls a ""moderate"" showing.Weather Dampens DemandOverall, the month was ""OK"" and a repeat of December's showing of a 3.4% comps rise, he said.""It's overwhelmingly a weather story on top of a low-volume month,"" said Niemira. ""Therefore, I don't read too much into the numbers for the long haul. It certainly had an impact on the month and the quarter. But it doesn't mean there's a fundamental weakness.""As the months go by there's often a ""bigger rebound from the exceedingly weak demand we're seeing because of the weather,"" he added. ""We may have to wait until March, but as long as the economy continues to perform well, which is our expectation, I would tend to look beyond the weather.""There were some bright spots during the month. Upside surprises from warehouse club giant Costco, Victoria's Secret's parent L Brands, and drugstore chains Walgreen (WAG) and Rite Aid (RAD) accounted for much of the beat, Perkins says.Also on the bright side, giant apparel retailer Gap (GPS) posted January comps well ahead of views.Costco came in with a solid 4% comp for the total company, ahead of forecasts for a 3.4% gain. Its U.S. same-store sales, excluding the negative impact of gasoline prices, climbed 5%.L Brands posted a 9% rise in comps vs. a year earlier, sailing past forecasts for a 0.5% gain.L Brands had to discount ""quite a bit"" during the month, as did most apparel retailers, said Perkins. But, he adds, it still came in with a strong comp gain even as it faced a tough comparison with last January's 9% increase in same-store sales.""That's impressive, even though they had to take markdowns,"" said Perkins.L Brands also raised Q4 earnings guidance, ""something virtually no retailers have done this quarter,"" Perkins said.Gap Guides UpGap posted a 1% increase in January same-store sales late Thursday, smashing views for a 1.1% decline.Gap also announced Q4 earnings guidance in the range of 65 cents to 66 cents a share.

1801,GPS,"Trimble Navigation (TRMB) may well face head winds in its key agriculture business this year as low commodity prices threaten to eat into farmers' spending power.
"
1802,GPS,"That shouldn't stop the maker of Global Positioning System gear and other location technologies from reaping the benefits of a strong market position and generating solid gains in its engineering and construction business, analysts say.
"
1803,GPS,"Trimble has evolved from offering simple GPS-based positioning devices to providing advanced software and data subscription products to improve equipment accuracy and efficiency in farming, construction and other industries.
"
1804,GPS,"Its lineup includes products that automate large industrial machines such as tractors and bulldozers, surveying instruments, integrated systems that track fleets of vehicles and workers while providing real-time analytics to the back office, and software solutions that connect all aspects of a construction site or farm.
"

"
1806,GPS,"Down On The Farm
"
1807,GPS,"Here's where the head wind comes in: Farmers' income levels are a function of commodity prices, and after hitting record levels in 2012 and 2013, prices of commodities such as corn have ""declined pretty substantially,"" Connors says.
"
1808,GPS,"""As lower commodity prices impact farmers' income levels this will create a head wind for their business this year,"" he said.
"
1809,GPS,"Still, Connors expects Trimble's agriculture business to continue to grow, though likely a ""little more slowly"" than last year.
"
1810,GPS,"""I think sales will hold up relatively well,"" he added. ""Farmers are still in an adoption cycle of technology. Even in a down market for agriculture as a whole, farmers continue to accelerate the implementation of technology. That remains a powerful growth driver for Trimble.""
"
1811,GPS,"Trimble has capitalized on a trend called precision farming, which is the use of GPS-enabled devices and software to improve farm efficiency and productivity.
"
1812,GPS,"Through its offerings in this area, the company helps farmers with every step of the farming process, including land preparation, then the planting, nutrient and pest management, and harvesting phases of a crop cycle.

"
1813,GPS,"The company offers operations management tools with its Connected Farm platform, which allows information exchange across an entire farm.

1814,GPS,"Trimble's ability to integrate GPS or other location technologies with application software that boosts productivity has helped the company's advantage, analysts say.
"
1815,GPS,"That advantage is reflected in its track record: Trimble has posted double-digit profit gains in all but two of the past 15 quarters. It is expected to keep up that growth level. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect first-quarter earnings, to be reported on May 6, to rise 11% to 42 cents a share.

"
1843,GPS,"While weather was the main head wind in February, other factors have been weighing on the retail industry.

1844,GPS,"For one thing, consumer spending has ""generally been sluggish,"" Perkins said, with more going more into entertainment and big-ticket items as well as online sales.
"
1845,GPS,"""And price competition has been fierce,"" he added. ""These are all the factors that have weighed on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers as they transition into having more omnichannel operations.""

1887,GPS,"Corruption: A new batch of IRS documents shows an agency that's more political than practical. Besides harassing groups applying for nonprofit status, it went after donors of existing groups.Documents produced by the IRS confirm that being on the wrong side of this administration is a dangerous place to be.Judicial Watch, which used the Freedom of Information Act to pry the documents from the government's grasp, said Wednesday they ""confirm that the IRS used donor lists to tax-exempt organizations to target those donors for audits.""Among these groups was the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. That organization ""may find itself under high scrutiny,"" an IRS official whose name was redacted told IRS attorney Lorraine Gardner in an email.""One can only hope,"" that unnamed official added.Another group whose donors were objects of extra IRS attention was Crossroads GPS, a group founded by Karl Rove, a member of President George W. Bush's staff.It appears that the IRS' pretext for the audits was the gift tax that was once levied on donations to nonprofits. It has not been enforced since 1982, Judicial Watch pointed out, because the Supreme Court ruled it violated the First Amendment.Naturally, the records show that former IRS official Lois Lerner supported the gift tax audits.The documents clearly indicate that the IRS' focus was political. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says that ""snarky comments"" found in the documents ""about the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the obsession with conservative Crossroads GPS show that the IRS was targeting critics of the Obama administration.""Fitton says that ""President Obama may want to continue to lie about his IRS scandal"" — he denied the issue existed as recently as this week — but Fitton has sifted through the documents and believes they ""tell the truth.""Fitton adds: ""His IRS hated conservatives and was willing to illegally tax and audit citizens to shut down opposition to Barack Obama's policies and re-election.""It would be comforting to think that because the IRS has been exposed, groups that oppose the administration are now safe from harassment.But that's not the case. The Government Accountability Office has issued a report saying political targeting of nonprofits is still ""possible in the audit process.""The watchdog notes: ""Unfortunately, the IRS has not taken sufficient steps to prevent targeting Americans based on their personal beliefs.""Political beliefs aren't alone under the glare. The GAO says targeting can be based on an organization's religious or educational position as well as ""other views.""The IRS was intended to be a revenue-collecting arm of the government, not a weapon politicians can use to crush their opponents. But that's what it's become and it's far beyond reform. It needs to be at the front of a long line of federal agencies that are abolished.

1922,GPS,"President Obama is rather proud of using words and economic sanctions as his major diplomatic weapon to convince recalcitrant countries to abide by international law.He admits they're not ""sexy."" Also, they haven't worked anywhere -- not on Iran, for instance. Not on Syria.But Monday the Democrat announced another round of sanctions anyway on Russian leaders and industrial sectors to convince President Putin to live up to his agreement to help settle down Russian insurgents in eastern Ukraine.Secy. of State John Kerry says the militants are directed from Moscow with the goal of disrupting Ukraine's May 25 national elections.Russia, the U.S. and European countries signed a previous accord in 1993 guaranteeing Ukrainian territorial integrity as an incentive for Ukraine to give up its nuclear stockpiles. Ukraine complied. And we saw last month in Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea how much stock the ex-KGB colonel puts in written agreements.Obama has indicated he, along with less-enthusiastic European allies, will ratchet up sanctions until Russia complies. But don't hold your breath.More than 100,000 Russian troops remain massed on Ukraine's border, Insurgents continue violently seizing government buildings in eastern Ukraine. Reports from Moscow give little indication of adverse sanction effects. Travel agents are already packing spring-break tourist flights to the Black Sea coast of Russia's newly-conquered territory in Crimea.In the event of escalating sanctions, Russian diplomats promise a ""tit for tat"" exchange of punishments. Which might seem comical given Russia's relatively small economic power.Except for one major thing.Because Obama allowed the U.S. space shuttle program to die in 2011, scores of missions short of the crafts' designed lifespans, the only way for American astronauts to reach space and return now is in Soyuz spacecraft atop Russian rockets. This relinquished America's hard-won space superiority. The U.S. has also withdrawn from future joint Mars missions, its spot taken by Russia.A round-trip ticket to the International Space Station to and from Kazakhstan costs U.S. taxpayers more than $60 million per seat.For decades, the two Cold War enemies competed in space. Russia launched the first successful earth satellite and the first man into space. The U.S. was first -- and last -- on the Moon. China recently landed a craft there as preparation for future manned flights. It's building its own space station and global GPS satellite system.When the Cold War ended, Russian and American competitors turned to cooperation in manned exploration, building the space station. It's been manned and womaned continuously now for more than a decade by rotating crews from the U.S., Russia, Europe and Japan. Russians and Americans take turns as ISS commander.Dmitry Rogozin is Putin's Deputy Prime Minister overseeing defense and space programs. He's also among Putin confidantes targeted with asset freezes and travel bans.He warned vaguely, but ominously, Tuesday that the latest sanctions on Russia's science industry had the potential for also hurting Americans in space dependent on Russian technology and logistics for survival. ""We warned them,"" he said, ""we will reply to statements with statements, to actions with actions.""Then, a defiant Rogozin added mockingly: “After analyzing the sanctions against our space industry, I suggest the U.S. deliver its astronauts to the ISS with a trampoline.""RELATED:Residents of these 2 states live happier than other Americans

1940,GPS,"Retailers likely wrapped up the holiday season with modest December sales gains, as consumers kept their purse strings tight despite deep and widespread discounts throughout the month.As of Wednesday, analysts were expecting December sales at stores open at least a year to rise 2.6% annually, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.That would be on top of a 2.6% increase in December 2012 and down significantly compared to midyear same-store sales gains of 4% earlier in 2013. The final tally for last month will be released Thursday.The soft December forecast would follow a weak 1.9% comp gain in November, making for a lackluster holiday season overall.When factoring in reported comps for drugstore chains Rite Aid (RAD) and Walgreen (WAG), both of which beat expectations, the December forecast goes up to a 3.3% rise, Perkins says.""Both December and fourth quarter same-store sales and earnings expectations are very muted heading into tomorrow's reports,"" Perkins said in his report Wednesday.""Holiday 2013 was extremely competitive on the promotional front, particularly in the apparel and consumer electronics spaces. Mall traffic was sluggish virtually all season with modest upticks immediately pre- and post-Christmas. Online was strong and likely helped many retailers but probably did not expand the overall spending pie so much as it did shift how and where it was spent.""Walgreen already reported a 6.1% rise in December comps, topping views for a 4.2% rise. Rite Aid saw a 2.9% gain, besting forecasts for a 1.7% rise.Warehouse club giant and typical top retail performer Costco Wholesale (COST) is forecast to see a 1.8% gain in December comps vs. a year earlier. Its U.S. comps, excluding gasoline, are expected to be 3%.Analysts see Gap (GPS) posting a 1.5% rise in December comps.

Buckle (BKE) is expected to ring up a 1.1% increase.Overall, the holiday quarter — from November through January — is expected to be light.Fourth-quarter same-store sales for all publicly traded retailers are seen rising just 1.1%, according Perkins, and revenue is forecast to be up only 1.9%.Wall Street is looking for Q4 earnings to rise just 1.2% from a year earlier, Perkins says.Separately, ShopperTrak on Wednesday estimated national retail sales for November-December rose 2.7% vs. a year earlier to $265.9 billion, slightly better than its early-season forecast for a 2.4% bump. But foot traffic decreased 14.6%.According to data released by ComScore, U.S. online retail sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31 rose 10% from a year earlier to $46.5 billion.

"
1983,GPS,"Retailers kicked off the holiday season on a sour note with disappointing November sales gains in reports out Thursday.
"
1984,GPS,"Deep discounts throughout the month didn't do much to spark a spending spree, a sign that retailers could be in for some tough sledding as they enter the holiday season's home stretch.
"
1985,GPS,"Sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.9% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts had forecast a 2.9% gain. That was a sharp deceleration from October's 4% increase.
"
1986,GPS,"Two of the best-performing retailers over the past five years, Costco Wholesale (COST) and L Brands (LTD), both missed November views. Their results, says Perkins, reflect the tough retail environment that prompted widespread discounting throughout the month, well before the usual Black Friday promotions.
"
1987,GPS,"""The overall results were very disappointing,"" said Perkins. ""Santa delivered some early coal to retailers during November and during the Thanksgiving/Black Friday holiday weekend. It says that retailers are in for a real dogfight this holiday season.""
"
1988,GPS,"Deep Discounts In Store?
"
1989,GPS,"Retailers are going to find it difficult to ""squeeze blood from a stone,"" he adds, given that most consumers don't have excess discretionary dollars to spend.
"
1990,GPS,"It means that stores will have to offer 50% off or more to get consumers to spend, Perkins says.
"
1991,GPS,"L Brands cited a late Thanksgiving as a major negative. For November the company reported a sales decrease of 5% from October, its first negative monthly comp since October 2009. Analysts had forecast a 1.2% decrease. The parent of Victoria's Secret indicated that it expects December comps to rise in the low- to mid-single digits, Perkins says.
"
1992,GPS,"Costco's total company comps, including gasoline sales, were up 2% vs. a year ago, missing views for a 3.5% gain. It was its smallest gain for the giant warehouse club discounter dating back to September 2009. Costco's core U.S. comps, excluding the impact of gasoline sales, came in at a 3% rise, short of forecasts for a 4.5% gain.
"
1993,GPS,"Perkins says Costco's showing reflects the ""broader consumer caution out there and their unwillingness and inability to open their purse strings.""
"
1994,GPS,"Regional discounter Stein Mart (SMRT), a strong performer of late, was also off its game in November. It posted a 3.1% rise in comps for the month, slightly missing views for a 3.2% rise.

1995,GPS,"Apparel giant Gap (GPS) gave some cheery news late Thursday when it reported a 2% rise in November comps, well ahead of the 0.7% expected gain. But action-sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ) saw a 1.7% lift, sharply missing forecasts for a 2.8% rise.

1996,GPS,"Perkins says the November showing overall ""doesn't bode well for the final stretch"" of the holiday season — it suggests the holiday period will be weaker than expected.

2000,GPS,"The economic factors he refers to include a ""strong"" GDP report on Thursday.
"
2001,GPS,"Niemira forecasts a gain of 3.4% vs. a year ago in GAFO (general merchandise, apparel and accessories, furniture and other) sales for November-December. That would compare with last year's 3% increase, he says. Niemira calculates November comps for the 12 monthly reporting retailers he tracks came in up 2.1% vs. a year ag o.
"
2002,GPS,"He expects December same-store sales growth to come in at 3% to 4%, and says that's conservative and may come in stronger — as this year Cyber Monday sales will be pushed into December while last year that online shopping frenzy occurred in November.
"
2003,GPS,"""Cyber Monday would give an even larger lift to December's sales,"" Niemira said.
"
2004,GPS,"November's soft showing, Niemira says, raises some questions. One is: ""How representative of the broader industry were the results, especially given the 10.1% gain in November same-store sales J.C. Penney (JCP) reported,"" he said. ""Is J.C. Penney taking market share from other retailers?""

2005,GPS,"Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research at Thomson Reuters, has concerns about the holiday shopping season, given November's soft results.
"
2006,GPS,"""November same-store sales are very worrisome,"" she said. ""They suggest that consumers are procrastinating and waiting for last-minute deals. They believe that as they approach the holiday the deals will get better. That doesn't bode well for retailers. It's a very promotional environment, and that means they will have to continue to do so.""

2007,GPS,"Old Stock For New Year
"
2008,GPS,"Another concern for Martis: Thursday's revised GDP number ""suggests retailers have high inventory levels,"" she says, which ""speaks to discounting going into January."" So when January arrives and consumers use their gift cards, she adds, they'll do so to buy discounted items vs. full-price items, which might hurt the bottom line.
"
2009,GPS,"Thomson Reuters analysts have lowered their November-through-January comp expectation to 1.7% from their month-old 1.8% view. That would be slightly higher than last year's 1.6% rise in comps for the quarter but still below the ""healthy"" level of a 3% gain, Martis says.

And that battle to win customers is likely to continue this month, analysts say.""This year Black Friday gave us a taste of what to expect for the remainder of the holiday selling season: intense competition, deep discounts and choppy mall traffic,"" Sterne Agee analyst Ike Boruchow said in a report.""Earlier store openings drove heavy traffic, which dissipated and then bounced through the day.""Fashion house Michael Kors, which has been a strong performer since its December 2011 stock market debut, enjoyed heavy traffic in its stores.Shares, up 61% this year, were slightly higher in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Other Black Friday traffic winners included L Brands' Victoria's Secret, Gap's Gap brand and Ann's (ANN) Loft.L Brands' Bath & Body Works also saw long lines at the register even in the early morning hours, while Gap's 50% off everything promotion drove traffic to its namesake brand stores, as did Loft's 50% off promo, Boruchow said.Gap shares were up 2% at 41.79, while L Brands was flat and Ann was 1% lower at 35.34.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), which upped its Black Friday promo to 50% off everything from last year's 40%, also drew in shoppers and rang up sales.

Boruchow also noted that shoppers flocked to malls starting Thursday evening and into early Friday, tailing off around 3 a.m. before picking up again starting around 10 a.m.Thanksgiving Day traffic rose 27% to nearly 45 million shoppers, and Black Friday traffic increased 3% to over 92 million, according to the National Retail Federation.Despite the pickup in traffic, steep discounts helped consumers keep their spending down a bit.

2045,GPS,"Retailers likely kicked off the holiday season with modest November sales gains as cautious consumers kept budgets tight even as stores tried to lure them with heavy discounting throughout the month.As of Wednesday, analysts were expecting November sales at stores open at least a year — the data will be released Thursday — to rise 2.9% vs. a year ago, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.That would mark a sharp deceleration from October's 4% annual gain, despite retailers' efforts to drum up business with aggressive deals all month. November's uptick would also come off an easy comparison vs. last November's comp, which came in at a 0.1% rise.Perkins says November's showing ""boiled down"" to the final week of the month. And that wasn't so hot.The National Retail Federation estimates Thanksgiving weekend sales fell 2.7% to $57.4 billion. The trade group also estimates shoppers on average spent 4% less than they did last year.ShopperTrak reported Thanksgiving/Black Friday sales rose 2.3% to $12.3 billion. But Black Friday foot traffic was down 11.4% vs. a year earlier and sales fell 13.2%, ShopperTrak reports, as traffic and sales were pulled into Thanksgiving Day.""A lackluster Black Friday week of selling, despite rather deep discounting across the retail landscape, suggests a very cautious consumer that's focused strictly on deals and is emblematic of a deeper concern,"" Perkins said.That concern, he says, is that the vast majority of consumers don't have a lot of discretionary dollars to spend.If analysts are on target with their November comps forecast, it would signal some tough sledding for retailers as they round the home stretch of the holiday season, when there's typically a ""lull"" in business.""It says there's going to be a heated battle for the next 20 days,"" Perkins said. ""If it's not on sale, it's not going to sell. Retailers will have to think about how to get consumers into stores the next couple of weeks.""Giant drugstore chain operator Walgreen (WAG) already reported November comps of a 3.2% gain, missing views by 50 basis points.Warehouse club giant and typical top retail performer Costco Wholesale (COST) is forecast to see a 3.5% rise in November comps vs. a year earlier. Its U.S. comps, excluding gasoline, are projected to increase 4.5%.Perkins says expectations were low heading into the month, so there might be some positive surprises. He says apparel giant Gap (GPS) and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LTD) ""have the possibility of surprising on the upside,"" given they were promotional during the month and the expectations for the two retailers are ""quite modest.""Analysts see Gap posting a 0.7% rise in November comps. They expect L Brands to see a decline of 1.2%.In the struggling teen space, action sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ) is expected to show a 2.8% rise in November comps. Teen retailer Buckle (BKE) is seen posting a 0.7% decline.A bit of good news came after the market closed Tuesday. Ailing department store chain J.C. Penney (JCP) announced November same-store sales increased for a second straight month, rising by 10.1%, ""relative to a very low bar set over the past five years,"" Perkins noted.""While a second month of positive comps is encouraging, we would not get too excited given the heavy promotions it took to drive the comp gain,"" Perkins said in his report.

2047,GPS,"Retailers posted soft February sales gains Thursday as frigid temperatures in many parts of the U.S. kept consumers out of the malls, but business picked up during the month's second half — an encouraging sign given the harsh-weather head winds.
"
2048,GPS,"February sales at stores open at least a year were up 2.7% — in line with analysts' forecasts — for those retailers that have reported so far, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
"
2049,GPS,"The tally excludes results from apparel giant Gap (GPS), which reports after the close. Using analysts' estimates for a 1.1% rise in Gap's February comps, total same-store sales would be up 2.6%, Perkins said. The soft February follows a 3.3% comp gain in January.
"
2050,GPS,"February comp gains were a much weaker 1.7% when factoring out results from drugstore chains Walgreen (WAG) and Rite Aid (RAD), he noted.
"
2051,GPS,"""The results were largely in line,"" Perkins said. ""With the adverse weather conditions, they could have been worse than we expected. Business looked to have picked up around Valentine's Day and the back half of the month wasn't as weak as it could have been.""

2079,GPS,"The tech industry is always looking to create the next big thing and wearable devices appear to be it, judging by the intense attention to the upcoming IPO of Fitbit.
"
2080,GPS,"Investor interest in the maker of devices used by people to achieve health and fitness goals is at a level that one underwriter reportedly described as pandemonium.
"
2081,GPS,"Fitbit (FIT) plans to raise $621 million, at the midpoint of the price's range, up 38% from an earlier plan to raise $448.5 million. That would make it the fifth-largest IPO on U.S. markets this year, out of 78 thus far. It plans to offer 34.5 million shares at 17 to 19 each. That's up from 29.9 million shares at 14 to 16.
"
2082,GPS,"Fitbit's IPO, as projected, will surpass that of GoPro (GPRO), the first IPO in the wearable sector. GoPro raised $491 million with its June 2014 IPO. The maker of wearable action cameras priced at 24 and gained 31% from its IPO price on its first day. GoPro stock is up 143% from its IPO price, trading near 58.
"
2083,GPS,"Fitbit is scheduled to price late Wednesday and begin trading Thursday on the NYSE under the ticker FIT.
"
2084,GPS,"The wearables market is getting increasingly crowded. Apple (AAPL) is the latest entrant with its Apple Watch, which also has health and fitness tracking apps and became widely available on April 24. Fitbit currently leads the market.
"
2085,GPS,"Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at research firm IPOboutique.com, says despite increased competition Fitbit is in good shape.
"
2086,GPS,"""Their customer service is considered excellent,"" he said. ""Their products are getting rave reviews and it's selling itself via referrals.""
"
2087,GPS,"Sweet, who spoke to one of the IPO underwriters who told him of the pandemonium level, said that's the first time he's heard that phrase used since the May 2012 IPO of Facebook (FB), which raised $16 billion and was the largest tech IPO of the time, since surpassed by Alibaba Group (BABA).
"
2088,GPS,"""Fitbit's year-over-year growth rate has been astounding,"" Sweet said. ""Despite the so-called competition, Fitbit has an unbelievable market share.""
"
2089,GPS,"Research firm IDC estimates shipments of wearable devices tripled to 19.6 million units in 2014 from the prior year. It expects the market for wearable devices will top 126 million units in 2019.
"
2090,GPS,"THE COMPANY
"
2091,GPS,"Fitbit was founded in 2007 by James Park, who is chairman, CEO and president, and Eric Friedman, chief technology officer. Its first device shipped in 2009.
"
2092,GPS,"The San Francisco company offers a line of six wearable connected health and fitness trackers, either wrist-based or clip-on devices, plus accessories. They range in price from $59.95 to $249.95.
"
2093,GPS,"The various Fitbit devices have many functions. They can monitor heartbeats and sleep patterns, and count your steps, distance traveled and calories burned. The wristband displays real-time feedback to encourage users to become more active in their daily lives.
"
2094,GPS,"Fitbit's more advanced products include GPS connectivity to measure speed and distance. They feature deeper integration with smartphones too, such as the ability to receive call and text notifications and control music. Fitbit also sells a Wi-Fi scale that records weight, body fat and body mass. Its platform includes an online dashboard and mobile apps, which wirelessly and automatically sync with its devices. 
"
2095,GPS,"Fitbit has sold about 21 million devices. Its products are in more than 45,000 retail stores and more than 50 countries and online.
"
2096,GPS,"""Our platform enables all types of people to get fit their own way, whatever their interests and goals,"" Fitbit said in its prospectus. ""Our users range from people interested in improving their health and fitness through everyday activities to endurance athletes seeking to maximize their performance.""
"
2097,GPS,"NPD Group says more than 25% of U.S. consumers reported using a fitness app on their smartphone.
"
2098,GPS,"Fitbit has an 85% market share in ""connected activity trackers,"" its prospectus says, citing data from research group NPD. It described connected activity trackers as digital fitness wearables that connect to mobile devices and computers.
"
2099,GPS,"Fitbit says advances in sensors, lower power components, and longer-life batteries, with advancements in low-energy wireless, have enabled the emergence of smaller, more power-efficient connected devices that track a broader range of biometric data and fit a wide range of consumer preferences.
"
2100,GPS,"THE RESULTS
"
2101,GPS,"Fitbit reported revenue of $745.4 million in 2014, up 175% from the $271 million in the prior year. It reported net income of $131.8 million in 2014, compared with a net loss of $51.6 million.
"
2102,GPS,"As of March 31, it had cash and cash equivalents of $237.8 million and total long-term debt of $159.6 million. The company spent $112 million on sales and marketing in 2014, up from $26.8 million in the prior year. Research and development spending was $54 million, up from $27.8 million.
"
2103,GPS,"Fitbit says it sold 10.9 million devices in '14, more than double the 4.5 million sold in the prior year.
"
2104,GPS,"RISKS/CHALLENGES
"
2105,GPS,"Though a relatively new category, the wearable device sector is highly competitive.
"
2106,GPS,"In addition to Apple, other players in the wearable field include Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA). Microsoft recently announced a wide-ranging software update for its Microsoft Band fitness tracker. In its IPO prospectus, Fitbit also lists Samsung, Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone and Misfit.
"
2107,GPS,"Vendors tripled their wearable shipments in the first quarter to 11.4 million units from just 3.8 million in Q1 2014, reports IDC.
"
2108,GPS,"While Fitbit dominates in its core fitness tracking market with an 85% share, that's not so in the overall wearable market.
"
2109,GPS,"IDC says that shipments of Fitbit wearables rose 129% to 3.9 million in the first quarter. Fitbit held the lead with a 34% market share, but that's down from 45% in the same quarter a year ago, as more competitors have entered the market.
"
2110,GPS,"Charging into the market for the No. 2 spot in Q1 was China-based Xiaomi, which also makes Apple-like smartphones. Xiaomi held a 24.6% share, IDC said. Xiaomi started shipping its Mi Band in the second half of 2014, followed by Garmin, Samsung and Jawbone.
"
2111,GPS,"""What remains to be seen is how Apple's arrival will change the landscape,"" said IDC analyst Ramon Llamas.
"
2112,GPS,"The Apple Watch will likely become the device other wearables are measured against, fairly or not, he says. But there is a difference. The Apple Watch is the most versatile wearable of the bunch, supported by its huge software ecosystem.
"
2113,GPS,"Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves expects 11 million Apple Watch unit sales this year. But ""after strong initial demand, follow-on interest in Apple Watch appears mediocre,"" he said in a research note Monday.
"
2114,GPS,"Fitbit is not a one-size-fits-all like the Apple Watch. And users could buy three Fitbit devices for the price of an Apple Watch.
"
2115,GPS,"""There are a lot of different devices on the market,"" Llamas said. ""Fitbit is not looking to be all things to all people, and the market is still very young.""
"
2116,GPS,"PROCEEDS
"
2117,GPS,"Of the $621 million expected to be raised, based on the midpoint of its offering, $218 million will go to selling shareholders, of which Fitbit will not receive any of the proceeds. Of the remaining $403 million, Fitbit expects proceeds of $373.9 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses.
"
2118,GPS,"It intends to use net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including research and development and sales and marketing activities. Fitbit said it has ""no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds.""

Its first device shipped in 2009.The San Francisco company offers a line of six wearable connected health and fitness trackers, either wrist-based or clip-on devices, plus accessories. They range in price from $59.95 to $249.95.The various Fitbit devices have many functions. They can monitor heartbeats and sleep patterns, and count your steps, distance traveled and calories burned. The wristband displays real-time feedback to encourage users to become more active in their daily lives.Fitbit's more advanced products include GPS connectivity to measure speed and distance. They feature deeper integration with smartphones too, such as the ability to receive call and text notifications and control music. Fitbit also sells a Wi-Fi scale that records weight, body fat and body mass. Its platform includes an online dashboard and mobile apps, which wirelessly and automatically sync with its devices. Fitbit has sold about 21 million devices. Its products are in more than 45,000 retail stores and more than 50 countries and online.""Our platform enables all types of people to get fit their own way, whatever their interests and goals,"" Fitbit said in its prospectus. ""Our users range from people interested in improving their health and fitness through everyday activities to endurance athletes seeking to maximize their performance.""NPD Group says more than 25% of U.S. consumers reported using a fitness app on their smartphone.Fitbit has an 85% market share in ""connected activity trackers,"" its prospectus says, citing data from research group NPD. It described connected activity trackers as digital fitness wearables that connect to mobile devices and computers.Fitbit says advances in sensors, lower power components, and longer-life batteries, with advancements in low-energy wireless, have enabled the emergence of smaller, more power-efficient connected devices that track a broader range of biometric data and fit a wide range of consumer preferences.THE RESULTSFitbit reported revenue of $745.4 million in 2014, up 175% from the $271 million in the prior year. It reported net income of $131.8 million in 2014, compared with a net loss of $51.6 million.As of March 31, it had cash and cash equivalents of $237.8 million and total long-term debt of $159.6 million. The company spent $112 million on sales and marketing in 2014, up from $26.8 million in the prior year. Research and development spending was $54 million, up from $27.8 million.Fitbit says it sold 10.9 million devices in '14, more than double the 4.5 million sold in the prior year.RISKS/CHALLENGESThough a relatively new category, the wearable device sector is highly competitive.In addition to Apple, other players in the wearable field include Microsoft (MSFT) and Under Armour (UA). Microsoft recently announced a wide-ranging software update for its Microsoft Band fitness tracker. In its IPO prospectus, Fitbit also lists Samsung, Garmin (GRMN), Jawbone and Misfit.Vendors tripled their wearable shipments in the first quarter to 11.4 million units from just 3.8 million in Q1 2014, reports IDC.While Fitbit dominates in its core fitness tracking market with an 85% share, that's not so in the overall wearable market.IDC says that shipments of Fitbit wearables rose 129% to 3.9 million in the first quarter. Fitbit held the lead with a 34% market share, but that's down from 45% in the same quarter a year ago, as more competitors have entered the market.Charging into the market for the No. 2 spot in Q1 was China-based Xiaomi, which also makes Apple-like smartphones. Xiaomi held a 24.6% share, IDC said. Xiaomi started shipping its Mi Band in the second half of 2014, followed by Garmin, Samsung and Jawbone.""What remains to be seen is how Apple's arrival will change the landscape,"" said IDC analyst Ramon Llamas.The Apple Watch will likely become the device other wearables are measured against, fairly or not, he says. But there is a difference. The Apple Watch is the most versatile wearable of the bunch, supported by its huge software ecosystem.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves expects 11 million Apple Watch unit sales this year. But ""after strong initial demand, follow-on interest in Apple Watch appears mediocre,"" he said in a research note Monday.Fitbit is not a one-size-fits-all like the Apple Watch. And users could buy three Fitbit devices for the price of an Apple Watch.""There are a lot of different devices on the market,"" Llamas said. ""Fitbit is not looking to be all things to all people, and the market is still very young.""PROCEEDSOf the $621 million expected to be raised, based on the midpoint of its offering, $218 million will go to selling shareholders, of which Fitbit will not receive any of the proceeds. Of the remaining $403 million, Fitbit expects proceeds of $373.9 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses.It intends to use net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including research and development and sales and marketing activities. Fitbit said it has ""no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds.""MANAGEMENTJames ParkCEO, president and chairmanPark, 38, has been CEO and president since 2007.

2133,GPS,"The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) has been putting a dismal show lately owing to bleak earnings performance in the last reported quarter. It missed earnings estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2018, after four straight quarters of beat. Further, the company is witnessing softness across its namesake brand, which has been a key impediment for quite some time.Though shares of Gap gained 8.7% in the past three months, it lagged the industry’s 15.5% increase. Moreover, the stock has improved just 2.4% since reporting first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24. Also, the stock’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and VGM Score of C indicates that it has fallen out of investors’ favor.HurdlesThe lower-than-expected earnings for the fiscal first quarter can be attributed to operating issues at the Gap brand as well as an unseasonably cold and snowy weather. These two factors together resulted in higher inventory levels and strained margins in the quarter.Notably, Gap has been witnessing softness across its namesake brand for quite a while now. Apparently, comps fell 4% at Gap brand in first-quarter fiscal 2018, mainly owing to operational headwinds across timing of inventory, breadth of the product assortment and shortage of gaps in certain categories. The Gap brand has been undergoing operating model improvements for about a year now. While these actions should aid long-term growth for the brand, the near-term performance will continue to be impacted by the aforementioned headwinds.The headwinds at the brand as well as the unpleasant weather also impacted gross and operating margins, which contracted 120 basis points (bps) and 110 bps, respectively, excluding the effect of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard. Particularly, miss steps regarding the timing of inventory flows affected the time on offer and the ability to optimize margin. Though the company is working on fixing these issues, it anticipates the headwinds to persist in the fiscal second quarter.Is there Hope for Revival?While these near-term concerns remain, the company is well poised to steer through every market situation with its core Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic brands. Its consistent focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends bodes well. It has also been making constant efforts to bolster digital and mobile offerings alongside improving product acceptance.Additionally, the company has chosen to diversify into the growing athleisure market by launching a premium lifestyle and active-wear brand called Athleta. Further, it continues to witness solid growth for the Old Navy brand as evident from the robust comparable sales (comps) performance in the last few quarters. Backed by the prospects of these brands, the company announced a new growth strategy, focusing on its two growth brands: Old Navy and Athleta.The company expects net sales of more than $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, for each of the brands over the next few years, resulting from U.S. store expansion along with mobile and e-commerce growth. Additionally, the company plans to open 270 Old Navy and Athleta stores while simultaneously closing 200 underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores over the next three years. In sync with this strategy, the company’s plan to open 25 stores in fiscal 2018 is likely to comprise more of Athleta and Old Navy stores while it plans to close down Gap and Banana Republic stores.The company expects these new strategies to create about $500 million in expense savings over the next three years, portion of which will be reinvested in its growth goals.Looking for Top-Ranked Retail Stocks, Check TheseThe Buckle, Inc.

2134,GPS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.4% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GPS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Gap Q1 Earnings Miss, Revenues Top EstimatesGap reported lower-than-expected earnings in first-quarter fiscal 2018. However, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. With this, the company marked its sixth consecutive revenues beat, while earnings lagged estimates after four straight quarters of positive surprises. Further, management reiterated guidance for fiscal 2018.Q1 HighlightsIn the fiscal first quarter, Gap’s earnings of 42 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents. However, the bottom-line figure improved 16.7% from 36 cents in the year ago. Quarterly earnings per share reflect a favorable impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2017.Net sales grew 10% to $3,783 million and also fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,608 million. We note that the company adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 in the quarter. Excluding the effect from the adoption of new revenue recognition standard, the top line rose 6% year over year. Also, foreign currency translations aided revenue growth by $40 million.The company’s comparable store sales (comps) inched up 1% versus 2% increase in the year-ago period. Comps continued to gain from robust Old Navy performance, which was fueled by strength in category and improved traffic. Comps for both Old Navy and Banana Republic were up 3%, while the Gap brand’s comps fell 4%.MarginsGap’s gross profit rose 10% to $1,427 million, while gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 37.7%. Excluding the effect of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, gross profit grew 3%, while gross margin contracted 120 bps to 36.7% mainly owing to the company’s namesake brand.Furthermore, operating income declined 9.8% to $229 million, with operating margin contracting 130 bps to 6.1%. Excluding the effect of the adoption of the revenue recognition standard, operating margin fell 110 bps to 6.3%.FinancialsGap ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,210 million, long-term debt of $1,249 million and total stockholders’ equity of $3,197 million.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company used cash flow from operations of $66 million and incurred capital expenditures of $138 million. Gap had negative free cash flow of $204 million as of May 5, 2018.For fiscal 2018, management continues to project capital expenditures of roughly $800 million, which will be used for transformative infrastructure investments to enhance its omni-channel and digital strategies, including information technology as well as supply chain.Coming to Gap’s shareholder-friendly moves, the company paid dividends of $94 million in the reported quarter and bought back 3.2 million shares for approximately $100 million. It paid dividend of 24.25 cents per share in the quarter, which reflects growth of more than 5% year over year. Additionally, Gap announced a second-quarter dividend of 24.25 cents per share, which is payable on or after Aug 1, to shareholders of record on Jul 11.Moving ahead, management still plans to buyback worth roughly $100 million every quarter.Store UpdatesWhile Gap launched 62 stores including 26 company-operated and 36 were franchises, it shuttered 39 outlets in the first quarter. The stores that were closed included 20 company-operated and 19 franchise locations. Consequently, the company ended the quarter with 3,617 outlets in 45 countries, of which 3,171 were company-operated and 446 were franchises.In fiscal 2018, Gap anticipates opening nearly 25 company-operated stores, net of closures and repositions. In sync with its growth strategy, the company expects to open more of Athleta and Old Navy stores and close down Gap and Banana Republic stores.OutlookFollowing the mixed quarterly results, Gap reaffirmed outlook for fiscal 2018. Comps are still anticipated to be flat to up slightly. Earnings for the year are anticipated in the range of $2.55-$2.70 per share.Moreover, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 is still expected to be nearly 26% due to the impacts of the recent tax reform.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to five lower.The Gap, Inc. Price and Consensus  The Gap, Inc. Price and Consensus | The Gap, Inc.

2136,GPS,"U.S. stock markets closed significantly lower on Tuesday as a result of political turmoil in two major Eurozone countries, Italy and Spain. All three major indexes entered into negative territory as soon the markets opened after Memorial Day weekend and failed to recover at the closing bell. Banking stocks bore the brunt of the impact. Moreover, the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China is displaying no signs of ebbing, fanning investors’ apprehensions of a full-blown trade war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,361.45, decreasing 1.6% or 391.64 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) also fell 1.2% to close at 2,689.86. Likewise, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,396.59, declining 0.5%. A total of 7.58 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.58 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.49 -to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.63 to -1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX surged 28.7% to close at 17.02. During trading on Tuesday, Wall Street’s fear gauge once touched 18.68, its highest in two months.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow lost 1.6% marking its third straight negative session. Notably, 27 of the 30-stocks in the blue-chip index closed in the red while two traded in the green. The Dow suffered its worst day on a percentage basis since Apr 24. A loss of 391.64 points once again placed the blue-chip index in negative territory year to date.The S&P 500 decreased 1.2%, marking its third straight negative session, owing to 3.3% drop of the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), 1.8% decline in Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) and 1.6% decrease in Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI). Notably, nine out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. Like the Dow, S&P 500 also suffered its worst day on a percentage basis since Apr 24.Similarly, the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5% due to abroad-based market decline.Political Turmoil in EurozonePolitical crisis in Italy has created ripples across the global equity markets. The crisis arose after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the appointment of economy minister Paolo Savona a known critic of the European Union and European integration.Notably, Savona was recommended by a coalition of the populist 5 Star Movement and the League. Party leaders from 5 Star demanded Mattarella’s impeachment, per the Wall Street Journal. Collapse of a populist coalition raised concerns of an early election in the country, while short-term borrowing costs soared for the government in Rome.Meanwhile, markets were also rattled by the political turmoil in Spain. In an effort to oust Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Spain’s major opposition party has called for a parliamentary vote. This demand can be attributed to a court ruling which stated that the ruling party benefited from an illegal kickback when the country was undergoing a property boom.The political crisis in Europe and the apparent threat to the Euro project triggered a panic alarm. Investors rush to traditional safe havens like U.S. debt, dragging down U.S. 10-year bond yields to 2.77 from its highest of 3.1 recently. As a result, U.S. banks suffered. Furthermore, the Euro fell below $1.16 per dollar, its lowest this year. Consequently, the Dollar Index, which pits the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.68% Tuesday at 94.83.Major banks like Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chess & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS  -  Free Report)  lost 5.8%, 4.3%, 4%, 4% and 3.4%, respectively. The corporate and investment bank chief of JPMorgan indicated that the bank's second-quarter markets revenue would be flat compared with a year earlier. Moreover, the co-head of Morgan Stanley's wealth management division hinted slower activity since March.Except for Morgan Stanley, all four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trade Conflicts LingerOn Tuesday, the Trump administration stated that it will continue to take action on trade with China despite the fact that the two countries are engaged in high-level talks to defuse trade tensions. The United States will also continue to pursue litigation against China at the World Trade Organization. In a recent press release, the White House stated that the U.S. government is likely to release a list of $50 billion worth of Chinese goods that will be subject to a 25% tariff.Economic DataOn May 29, the Conference Board reported U.S. consumer confidence data for the month of May. The consumer confidence index for May is pegged at 128.0 compared with April’s revised reading of 125.6. May’s reading was also slightly better than the consensus estimate of 127.8. The Present Situation index, reflecting current conditions, reached at a 17-year high of 161.7 from 157.5 in the prior month. The Expectations index also increased to 105.6 from 104.3 in April.Stocks That Made HeadlinesGap Q1 Earnings Miss Hits Stock, Revenues Top EstimatesShares of The Gap Inc.

2138,GPS,"It was another interesting week on Wall Street, with early optimism about progress made in ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China giving way to caution after President Trump cancelled a proposed meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jung Un.On the earnings side of things, fresh reports from the likes of HP Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) helped mark one of the last busy stretches of the Q1 report season. Results were mixed this week, doing little to help broader indexes break out of the ranges they have been stuck in throughout recent months. Still, a few more marquee reports in the upcoming week have the potential to help that cause.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases.

Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report)Enterprise software and cloud computing giant Salesforce is slated to release its latest quarterly report after the market closes on May 29. Shares have moved nearly 10% higher in the past month, and the stock is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Still, Salesforce’s margins are thin, and its valuations are stretched—so the pressure will be on the company to deliver great results.According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, analysts expect Salesforce to report adjusted earnings of $0.46 per share and revenue of $2.94 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 64% and 23%, respectively. Investors should also note that this earnings projection has trended upward over the duration of the quarter. 2. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report)Big-box retail giant Costco is set to announce its most recent quarterly earnings results after the closing bell on May 31.

The stock is carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) ahead of its report date.Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Costco to report adjusted earnings of $1.68 per share and revenue of $31.74 billion, which would mark year-over-year growth of 20% and 10%, respectively. Investors might also notice that shares a bit pricey at 28.9x forward 12-month earnings right now. 3. Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report)Cosmetics retailer Ulta is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report after the market closes on May 31. The stock has yet to fully recover since tumbling off its highs last summer, but shares have started to pick up pace, moving more than 30% higher in two months.

2139,GPS,"Markets closed slightly lower on Thursday after President Donald Trump scrapped his planned meeting with North Korea’s premier Kim Jong Un. Further, Trump also threatened to impose import duty on cars and trucks that took a toll on the markets. Moreover, the broader energy sector took a hit as investors dumped energy stocks as oil prices declined on news that Opec members could escalate production to ease supply restraint from Iran and Venezuela.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined 0.3% to close at 24,811.75. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to close at 2,727.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed almost unchanged at 7,424.43, declining less than 0.1%. A total of 6.3 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How did the Benchmark Perform?The Dow lost 75.05 points after hitting a lot of as much as 280.91 points on news of Trump cancelling the Singapore summit. However, the losses were pared by gains in Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report).The S&P 500 lost 5.53 points, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) and Financial Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) losing 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors ended the day in negative territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq made a marginal loss of 1.53 points.Trump Cancels Meeting with Kim Jong UnTrump on Thursday cancelled the scheduled June 12 Singapore summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Trump cited “open hostility” from North Korea as the reason behind the cancellation of the meeting. This would have been the first face-to-face meeting with an U.S. president and a North Korean leader.The cancellation followed even though North Korea kept its promise to blow up tunnels at its nuclear test site. The news dented investors’ confidence, with stocks taking a hit immediately. However, the initial losses were pared later after shares of Netflix and General Electric rallied. Netflix’s market value jumped to $153 billion, surpassing Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) for the first time to make it the world’s most valuable entertainment company.Oil Prices Fall Investors shunned energy stocks on Thursday, on possibilities of easing oil production caps by Russia and Opec countries sending crude oil prices lower. News of Opec members planning to increase the production of oil in order to ease supply constraints from Venezuela and Iran, saw investors panicking over crude oil prices going down. Both Iran and Venezuela are under threat from U.S. sanctions.This saw major energy stocks plummeting with Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report) and Apache Corporation (APA  -  Free Report) declining 3.1% each.

Also, foreign currency translations aided revenue growth by $40 million.The company’s comparable store sales (comps) edged up 1% versus 2% increase in the year-ago period.

2141,GPS,"Abercrombie & Fitch Company (ANF  -  Free Report) is progressing well on its growth path, driven by strategic capital investments, cost-saving efforts along with loyalty and marketing programs.

Further, it remains encouraged by comps performance that gained from the rise in traffic and conversion. (Read More: Abercrombie Jumps on Q4 Earnings Beat, Guides for FY18)Favorable Estimate RevisionsFollowing the upbeat quarter, the company provided an encouraging view for fiscal 2018 which led to an uptrend in estimates. For fiscal 2018, both comps and sales are projected to be up in low-single digit. Top line gains from the favorable currency rates will be offset by the absence of the additional week sales in 2017.Favorable foreign currency rate is expected to contribute nearly $50 million to sales and $15 million to operating income in fiscal 2018. Furthermore, it expects core tax rate to be in the mid-to-high 20s range, driven by the recently enacted tax reform.Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Abercrombie & Fitch Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Abercrombie & Fitch Company QuoteConsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed an uptrend in the last 30 days. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and 2019 climbed substantially to 68 cents and 71 cents per share, respectively, from previous estimates of 47 cents and 60 cents.Going forward, the company remains keen on further improving customer experience by investing in loyalty programs, stores, direct-to-consumer and omni-channel capabilities. Further, it expects to maintain the disciplined approach to expense management for driving top- and bottom-line growth. So, here is a sneak peek into the company’s initiatives which are fueling growth.Other CatalystsAbercrombie is making significant progress in expanding digital presence with the growth of direct-to-consumer and omni-channel capabilities. Its investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment have significantly aided the growth of the direct-to-consumer business, which delivered double-digit increase in both the United States and international markets in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Notably, digital engagement with consumers has been the company’s core strength. This is clear from the fact that more than 70% of the DTC traffic came from mobiles in the fourth quarter. Additionally, its investments in DTC are paying off with conversions improving 14% in the fourth quarter.Overall, the DTC business accounted for nearly 34% of net sales in the fourth quarter, recording 18% increase in comparable sales. In fiscal 2018, the company plans to continue investing in DTC capabilities alongside bringing innovations in this channel, using customer insights and data analytics.Additionally, Abercrombie is aggressively expanding Hollister stores in new markets. The idea is that the smaller size of operation makes it cheaper and less capital intensive compared with the namesake brand. Growth of the Hollister brand internationally could enhance its overall performance. The Hollister brand reflects persistent positive momentum from previous quarters, reaching the $2 billion mark in sales in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.Further, comparable store sales (comps) for the Hollister brand improved 11% in the fourth quarter as it continued to capitalize on the momentum, delivering positive comps in both the United States and international markets. Hollister is gaining from the positive customer response to product innovations, emerging categories and overall customer experience.Not only this, the company remains focused on streamlining its store-fleet by closing underperforming stores and expanding in markets with growth potential. Store closure gives Abercrombie more flexibility in terms of cost savings, amid a tough environment. Since 2010, it closed more than 400 stores while nearly 60% of its U.S. leases are set to expire in the next two years. This provides significant flexibility to strike the right channel balance and drive efficiency with options to remodel or resize stores, renegotiate leases or close stores.Looking for More Solid Picks, Check TheseInvestors can count upon some better-ranked stocks in the same industry like The Finish Line Inc. , The Gap, Inc.

2142,GPS,"Fossil Group, Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report), which was long shunned by investors owing to persistent softness in traditional watch category, has made quite a comeback. The company, which lost close to 70% in 2017, has rallied a whopping 69% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 8.2%.  So what made the renowned watch and accessories brand turn around? Well, the company’s wearables category has actually been contributing significantly. While Fossil is gaining from several other factors as well, strength in wearables seems to be its major driver, given consumers’ accelerated shift toward tech-savvy watches.Wearables Helps Fossil Tread Growth TrajectoryTo tap in on the rising demand for advanced gadgets, Fossil has been investing heavily to broaden its connected wearables portfolio. The wearables market provides the opportunity to combine fashion and technology and launch innovative products to meet consumers’ evolving needs of tech-enabled advanced connected gears. Moreover, the company is getting the advantage of Android’s popularity and Google’s technology in its watches.Clearly, Fossil’s transition to connected wearables and smartwatches has reaped results. The growing demand for advanced gadgets is reflected from the fact that Fossil’s connected products have almost doubled in the past two years, reaching close to $300 million in size. In fact, wearables represented almost 20% of the company’s total watch sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. That’s not it.Growth in the wearable’s category aided Fossil’s overall watch category to improve by more than 10 percentage points during the quarter. Additionally, the strong performance of wearables drove online sales, leading to a 2% rise in the company’s global retail comps during the quarter, while the watch category alone depicted comps growth of 5%.Notably, Fossil launched around 14 new hybrid and smartwatches across several brands during the second half of 2017The company is gearing up to enrich wearables portfolio by adding new brands to its smartwatch line-up in 2018 as the wearable business is expected to grow $32 billion by 2020.  E-commerce & New World Fossil — Other Keys to Fossil’s Success StoryOther than the marked success of its wearables category, Fossil has also been riding on solid focus on enhancing e-commerce operations, as well as its “New World Fossil” plan. Talking of e-commerce, the company has been making several investments to improve digital marketing and drive online sales, both for the company’s website as well as other online wholesale partners. In fact, such dedicated endeavors helped e-commerce sales surge 31% during the fourth quarter. The e-commerce platform has also served as an important sales channel for wearables.Moving to New World Fossil, the company began this restructuring program back in 2016. The program aims to transform the company, fuel efficiencies, improve margins and enhance the overall operating structure of the business to drive profitability. Fossil intends to achieve these targets while simultaneously enriching customers’ experience amid a difficult retail landscape. Markedly, the company is well on track with its New World Fossil plan which helped it cut costs by $95 million in 2017, keeping it well-placed to achieve its profit improvement target of $200 million by the end of 2019.What’s Ahead?Unfortunately, Fossil has long been suffering from sluggish traditional watch business and persistent weakness in the leather and jewelry categories. These factors and strained gross margins acted as major dampeners on the company’s fourth-quarter top and bottom lines. Though management continues to expect a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category in 2018, we expect the aforementioned factors (particularly strong wearables sales) to help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to offset these hurdles.Looking for More Promising Bets?

2143,GPS,"The apparel and footwear industry are the latest to voice their concerns over President Donald Trump’s plans to impose tariffs on goods imported from China, as these will result in higher consumer prices. The U.S. government is apparently preparing to impose tariffs on Chinese information technology, telecommunications and consumer goods in order to force changes in China’s intellectual property and investment prices.Tariffs mean higher prices of products and this invariably has sparked fear among retailers, apparel manufacturers and shoemakers, as many of these companies rely on imports. Apart from a number of U.S. retail giants, the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) and as many as 82 footwear companies wrote a letter to the White House objecting to the tariff.However, the apparel and footwear industry, particularly men's and boys' apparel wholesaling, has been witnessing steady growth over the past five years and is expected to continue performing well in the days to come. Moreover, a recovering economy, increasing consumer confidence, wage growth and higher purchasing power have stimulated consumer expenditure on discretionary industry products, resulting in higher revenues for the companies.  Given this scenario, it makes for a good time to invest in apparel and footwear stock.Apparel Manufacturers, Shoemakers Oppose TariffsThe heavily China-reliant U.S. shoemakers and apparel manufactures have joined retailers in lobbying against Trump’s proposed tariffs on goods imported from that country for fear of an inordinate flare-up in prices of these consumer discretionary goods.In fact, Washington could impose more than $60 billion in tariffs on goods ranging from apparels to footwear, electronics and toys. Analysts are of the opinion that any additional broad-based tariff means burdening the American working families as they will have to pay higher prices for household basics like clothing, shoes and electronics.Not only apparel and shoemakers but also the entire U.S. fashion industry is worried about the proposed tariffs. In fact, the recent imposition of 25% and 10% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum too is going to hit the apparel and footwear industry.Steve Lamar, executive vice president of the AAFA remarked that imposing tariffs on imported items ultimately passes on the tax on to consumers. “There is a direct cost that rolls into our industry. It is not like the can industry or the auto industry, but it is there,” he said, adding that manufacturers, retailers and importers purchase trucks to haul merchandise and manufacturers package their goods in aluminum cans.Moreover, most shoemakers feel that footwear is already subject to hefty tariffs and more tariffs on top of this burden would only result in higher prices and fewer U.S. jobs.That said, the footwear and apparel industry has been performing well for a while now and tariff fears might be a bit overblown, more so because a strong lobby is showing aggressive opposition. Moreover, a recovering economy and higher wages are always an indication of increasing disposable income. So it might bit a too early to press the panic buttons.Steady Growth of Apparel and Footwear IndustryThe U.S. apparel and footwear industry has witnessed steady growth over the past few years. Especially, the men’s and boy’s apparel wholesaling industry has seen remarkable growth in the last five years and the trend is expect to continue in the future.The primary driver of this steady growth has been a recovering economy, which has seen an increase in consumer confidence and rising disposable income, resulting in higher consumer spending on consumer discretionary products from the apparel and footwear shelves. Moreover, an appreciating dollar and a continuing decline in cotton input prices for upstream manufacturers have combined to lower industry purchase costs, resulting in higher gains for the industry.Moreover, increasing wages and strong gains in per capita disposable income are expected to encourage more consumer expenditure on consumer discretionary products. Our ChoicesDespite tariff-induced concerns and the ensuing agitation, it is a bit too early to be apprehensive, especially since apparel manufacturers and shoemakers have been performing well for the last few years. Plus, a recovering economy, robust confidence, increasing wages and higher disposable income hint at the industry’s steady growth over the next five years.Adding apparel and footwear stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

2144,GPS,"The last few weeks of first-quarter earnings season has been dominated by retailers, from Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to Macy’s (M  -  Free Report). This trend is set to continue, so Zacks has investors covered with three retail stocks that look poised to top quarterly earnings estimates. The retail industry has been under pressure not only from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers but also from investors. Clothing retailer Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), which had been on a strong run over the last year, saw its stock price tumble nearly 14% on Friday after it released lower-than-expected Q1 earnings results Thursday. Therefore, retail investors need to be on the hunt for stocks that look set to top quarterly earnings estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these stocks ahead of their upcoming quarterly earnings reports. Check them out now:1.      DSW Inc. (DSW  -  Free Report)Shares of DSW have climbed nearly 31% over the year 12 weeks and 14% during the last four weeks, in a sign that investors might be expecting big things from this footwear retailer when it reports its first-quarter earnings results before the opening bell on Wednesday, May 30. DSW’s Q1 revenues are actually expected to slip by 1% from the year-ago period to $684.11 million, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates.But top-line growth is not all that matters. The company’s first-quarter earnings are projected to pop by 12.5% to touch $0.36 per share. Meanwhile, DSW’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for quarterly earnings of $0.37 per share, which is 1 cent better than our current consensus estimate. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 3.47%. Therefore, investors should consider DSW as a stock that could beat Q1 earnings estimates.2.       Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)Dollar General stock has surged 33.7% over the last year, yet shares have slipped over 2% in the last four weeks. However, this recent decline doesn’t seem to be based on the off-price retailer’s first-quarter outlook, with Dollar General’s quarterly revenues expected to climb by 10.3% to $6.19 billion. Moving on to the other end of the income statement, DG is projected to touch $1.40 per share, which would mark a nearly 36% surge from the prior-year period.DG is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an earnings ESP of 0.95%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.41 per share, coming in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. This means that Dollar General might be able to impress investors with a bottom line beat when it reports its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, May 31.3.       Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU  -  Free Report)Shares of this upscale athleisure giant have skyrocketed over 118% over the last year and 31% during the last 12 weeks. Lululemon’s quarterly revenues are projected to climb by 18.45% to touch $616.32 million. Investors should also be very excited to see that LULU’s earnings are expected soar 40.63% to hit $0.45 per share.Lululemon is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with an Earnings ESP of 0.29%. LULU’s Most Accurate Estimate also currently sits 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.

2147,GPS,"Investors in The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the May 25, 2018 $30.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Gap shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Gap is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry that ranks in the Top 29% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while three have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 46 cents per share to 45 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Gap right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2148,GPS,"Shares of Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) have climbed 10% over the last four weeks in a sign that investors might be anticipating strong quarterly financial results from the retailer. Let’s take a look to see what they should really expect from Gap in the first quarter.Gap follows a slew of other retail industry giants which have all reported their quarterly earnings results over the last few weeks, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), and  Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report). Not all of these companies have performed well following the release of their Q1 earnings, which means Gap could be under even more pressure on Thursday.With that said, Gap stock has surged 42.5% over the last year as it successfully faces down continued pressure from online sellers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), while also adapting to changing shopping patterns. However, a poor quarter could easily see Gap stock slip—at least in the near-term.Gap Q1 OutlookOur current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Gap’s quarterly revenues to climb by 4.9% to touch $3.61 billion. Moving on to the opposite end of the income statement, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to soar by 25% to reach $0.45 per share.Unfortunately for investors, Gap has experienced some downward earnings estimate revision activity recently. Meanwhile, investors also need to understand what chance Gap has to top our earnings estimate as this could help its stock price climb, especially following its earnings release.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.In contrast, a stock with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or worse, coupled with a negative Earnings ESP, is one that we typically want to avoid during earnings season.Gap is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and sports an Earnings ESP of -0.37%. This means that investors can consider GPS a stock that could fall short of quarterly earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday.  However, it is also worth remembering that the retailer’s earnings are still expected to surge by 25% from the year-ago period.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Further, the special committee believes that the company’s customer strategy positions it to capitalize on opportunities and gain market shares.The company’s customer strategy is based on three strategic pillars that focus on providing a differentiated product offering; delivering exceptional services and experiences; and leveraging the strength of its brand. Further, Nordstrom is on track to integrate its digital and physical assets to provide the best customer experience.

2151,GPS,"The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 24. The company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 11.1%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 45 cents, mirroring a year-over-year improvement of 25%. However, the estimate has moved down by a penny in the last seven days.The Gap, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Gap, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Gap, Inc. QuoteLet’s delve deeper to see how things are shaping up prior to the quarterly earnings announcement.What You Should KnowGap remains committed toward its growth strategy, which mainly focuses on the Old Navy and Athleta brands. Management expects net sales of more than $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, at each of the brands over the next few years, with these gains coming as a result of U.S. store expansion and mobile and e-commerce growth. Also, the company’s comps have been benefiting from robust Old Navy performance fueled by strength in category and improved traffic since the past few quarters.In addition, the company’s solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends bode well. Also, Gap’s endeavors to enhance the e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities by adopting a number of initiatives are commendable. Notably, the company has increased online presence across all of its brands. This, in turn, has made Gap’s online division the most profitable one, posting double-digit sales growth. In the fiscal first quarter, these factors are likely to add value to the company’s top-line growth and profitability.Notably, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect sales of $3.61 billion, up nearly 5% from the year-ago period. For Old Navy brand, the consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $1,634 million, up 4.6% year over year.However, Gap’s significant international presence exposes it to adverse currency fluctuations, which might adversely impact the company’s top and bottom line. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, currency dented earnings per share growth by about 2 cents per share. Also, currency woes along with stiff industry completion and other macroeconomic headwinds remain threats.Softness across the company’s namesake and Banana Republic brands also remains a concern. Notably, for the sales at Gap and Banana Republic brands the consensus mark is pegged at $1,152 million and $514 million, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year decline of about 1% for both brands.Given this backdrop, let’s wait and see what lies ahead of Gap in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Gap is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

However, the tough retail landscape and increased competition from peers have eroded the company’s profits in the recent past.

(LULU  -  Free Report).Further, the company has been witnessing solid growth for the Old Navy brand as evident from the robust comparable sales (comps) performance in the last few quarters. Backed by the prospects of these brands, the company announced a new growth strategy, focusing on its two growth brands: Old Navy and Athleta.The company expects net sales of more than $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, for each of the brands over the next few years, resulting from U.S. store expansion along with mobile and e-commerce growth. Additionally, the company plans to open 270 Old Navy and Athleta stores while simultaneously closing 200 underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores over the next three years. In sync with this strategy, the company’s plan to open 25 stores in fiscal 2018 is likely to comprise more of Athleta and Old Navy stores while it plans to close down Gap and Banana Republic stores.The company expects these new strategies to create about $500 million in expense savings over the next three years,  a portion of which will be reinvested in its growth goals.Omni-Channel EndeavorsIn a move to streamline its North American business, Gap is enhancing its e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities by adopting a number of initiatives.

Results were driven by solid sales growth, owing to the progress on its transformation efforts and other customer-centric initiatives. (Read More: Bed Bath & Beyond Down Despite Earnings Beat in Q4).However, this was not enough to woo investors as is clear from the significant drop in the company’s stock price since reporting the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Apr 11, 2018. The Bed Bath & Beyond stock fell as much as 19.7% since Apr 11, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.3%. The stock was mainly punished due to a weak fiscal 2018 outlook as the company expects the soft margin and comps trend to continue in the future.The company’s comps declined in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 due to the lower number of store transactions, somewhat mitigated by higher average transaction amounts. While comps from customer-facing digital networks improved, comps at stores fell at a mid-single-digit rate. Further, the company has a seven-quarter long trend of reporting strained margins due to higher shipping and coupon expenses, which continued in the fiscal fourth quarter.Consequently, the company provided a bleak outlook for fiscal 2018, which is likely to bear a 5 cents negative impact due to the absence of the 53rd week compared with the previous year. It expects a clear shift of sales and expenses from the fiscal fourth quarter to the third quarter due to the calendar shift. The company anticipates an earnings shift from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as well.For fiscal 2018, the company expects consolidated net sales to remain relatively flat to marginally up year over year. Driven by persistent growth in the customer-facing digital channel, it envisions comps to increase in the low-single-digit percentage range.Furthermore, Bed Bath & Beyond projects gross margin deleverage in fiscal 2018, mainly owing to continued investment in the customer value proposition and the constant shift to the digital channels. SG&A is estimated to increase on account of investments toward transformation. However, the company expects to witness operating margin to decline lower than that in fiscal 2017. Depreciation expenses are anticipated to be $315-$325 million while net interest expenses are projected to be $75 million. It also expects the tax rate to be 26-27% for the fiscal.Considering all these factors, the company envisions fiscal 2018 earnings per share to be in the low-to-mid-$2 range compared with adjusted earnings per share of $3.12 in fiscal 2017.Driven by the soft earnings view, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a downtrend in the last seven days.

2155,GPS,"The Wall Street is juggling with various macro and micro issues at the moment, including U.S.-China trade dispute, Facebook data breach, apprehensions about three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year and latest being the airstrike on Syria. All these events have kept the market on tenterhooks with investors scurrying for safe havens. A clear reflection of these factors were visible in the recent outcome of the Consumer Sentiment data that declined from its 14-year high.Per the preliminary report released by the University of Michigan, Consumer Sentiment index dropped to 97.8 in April from March’s reading of 101.4, and also came below analysts’ expectations of 100.5. Economists blamed negative news that popped up time and again for the nervousness in the market.Do Retailers Need to Worry?Apparently, consumers’ expectations about the economy have somewhat retreated. A fall in consumer sentiment may impact consumers’ spending pattern, which accounts for over two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. Undoubtedly, reluctance on the part of consumers to spend more is the last thing retailers want.Nevertheless, experts are of the opinion that consumer sentiment still remains at a decent level. Notably, the index inched up 0.8% this month from a year earlier. Published on The Wall Street Journal, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, Ian Shepherdson, said “the current conditions index spiked in March, presumably as people saw the tax cuts coming through, so a correction in April was always a decent bet.”Definitely, the retailers have nothing to fear as of now. A robust job market, massive tax cuts and sound economic fundamentals are likely to trigger consumer spending. Notably, a strengthening labor market may lead to gradual wage acceleration, and in turn boost consumer confidence. All these sound constructive for retailers.Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 4%. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness year-over-year bottom-line growth of 12%, per the Earnings Preview. This fares much better than the previous quarter, where earnings climbed 3%. Top-line is also projected to increase 7.6% compared with 9.7% growth registered in the preceding quarter.Wrapping UpWith earnings season all set to gather momentum it will be prudent to hold on to some retail stocks that are likely to beat estimates. These are stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

2156,GPS,"The S&P 500 index was down more than 1.5% in early afternoon trading Monday as Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) steep declines dragged tech stocks lower, triggering sell alerts and causing volatility to prevail as the trading week kicked off.Facebook’s slump is attributable to reports that emerged during the weekend linking the social media behemoth to questionable activity from political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.This data analysis company, which worked on Facebook ads for President Trump’s 2016 campaign, allegedly mishandled the personal information of about 50 million Facebook users, underscoring concerns about security and abuse within internet advertising.Morning volatility inspired by Facebook’s selloff was exacerbated as investors remembered several similar moments of panic over the past few months and ditched stocks accordingly. The broad S&P 500 sunk as much as 2% to hit an intraday low of 2,696.43.Nevertheless, several notable S&P companies remained in the green through early afternoon trading, desperately attempting to keep the index afloat on the day. Check out why a few of these stocks were able to fight that battle on Monday!Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report)Shares of Gap were up about 1.4% through early afternoon hours Monday. The retailer has had an up-and-down few weeks after reporting its latest quarterly financial results at the beginning of the month, but it looks like investors might finally be looking to reward the company for its impressive numbers.Just a few weeks ago, Gap notched adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents per share. Total revenues in the quarter touched $4.8 billion, up about 8% year over year and ahead of our consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Meanwhile, comps growth of 5% marked the retailer’s fifth-consecutive quarter of positive results in this key category.Since then, we have witnessed 13 positive analyst revisions for Gap’s full-year EPS estimates. The stock is now sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report)Shares of defense contractor Northrop Grumman moved about 1.2% higher in afternoon trading after the company secured a 10-year extension of its information technology services for the Social Security Administration. The new contract comes just two weeks after Northrop inked a $475 million deal to upgrade missile defense systems throughout the U.S.We have witnessed six positive revisions for Northrup’s full-year earnings estimates versus three negative revisions within the past 60 days. The stock remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG  -  Free Report)Signet shares were up more than 2.2% in early afternoon hours Monday, just a few trading periods after the jewelry retailer’s latest earnings report date. Last week, said that it saw quarterly revenues of $2.3 billion, up 1% year over year and slightly above our consensus estimates. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings of $4.28 per share came in two cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Nevertheless, Signet sold off nearly 20% in the immediate aftermath of its report. Today’s gains are a slight bounce from its post-earnings lows, signaling that investors might be willing to jump back in at a discount.Want more market analysis from this author?

2157,GPS,"Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report) looks quite disciplined in its approach of tackling prevailing headwinds in the retail landscape — soft store traffic, stiff competition from online retailers and aggressive pricing strategy. Despite the ultra-competitive retail scenario, the stock has surged 21.9% so far in the year against the industry’s decline of 4.5%.The company has undertaken transformational initiatives revolving around products, stores and marketing. These are likely to fuel top-line growth in fiscal 2018. Analysts polled by Zacks expect third-quarter and fiscal 2018 revenues to come in at $1.30 billion and $5.85 billion, reflecting an increase of roughly 30.8% and 30.4%, respectively.Multi-Brand StrategyTapestry is undergoing a brand transformation and is introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisition of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade has been accretive to performance and is being viewed as a significant step toward becoming a multi-brand company. Additionally, the company is aggressively expanding e-commerce platform. It also plans to undertake strategic measures involving, upgrading of core technology platforms and enhancement of international supply chain.Management expects to attain run-rate synergies of approximately $100-$115 million from Kate Spade buyout in fiscal 2019 compared with the prior view of $50 million. Kate Spade sales came in at $434.7 million, while net sales for Stuart Weitzman totaled $120.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Management continues to expect fiscal 2018 revenue to increase approximately 30% year over year to $5.8-$5.9 billion.Other Growth DriversAs one of the leading American marketers of fine accessories and gifts, Tapestry boasts a proven strategy of investing in stores to enhance sales output through product innovation, compelling pricing strategy, new merchandise assortments and a cost-effective global sourcing model. We believe that these strategies will help drive comparable-store sales and operating margins in the long term. The company’s growth drivers include expansion of global distribution model and venturing into under-penetrated markets. The company also launched Coach Create, a platform to customize bags either online or in outlets.Positive Earnings Surprise StreakTapestry’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 marked the 16th straight quarter of earnings beat. The adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents, thereby resulting in a positive earnings surprise of 24.4%. The quarterly earnings improved 42.7% year over year buoyed by top-line growth.On account of revisions to the U.S. tax code as well as lower interest expense, management now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the band of $2.52-$2.60, reflecting an increase of approximately 17-21%, comprising mid-to-high single digit accretion from the Kate Spade buyout. The company had earlier projected earnings in the range of $2.35-$2.40 per share.Wrapping UpSales increase at Coach brand, contributions from buyouts and sturdy holiday offerings along with improved inventory mix have favorably impacted the stock’s performance. However, fashion obsolescence remains the main concern for Tapestry’s business model, which involves a sustained focus on product and design innovation. The company’s pioneering position may be compromised by delays in its product launches. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company operates in the highly competitive premium handbag and accessories segment.Interested in Retail? 3 Picks You Can’t MissMacy’s (M  -  Free Report) has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.5% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2158,GPS,"Zumiez Inc.  delivered lower-than-expected earnings in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, despite solid top-line trends. Notably, sales topped estimates for the seventh straight quarter. Additionally, the company’s earnings and sales improved year over year.However, shares of Zumiez declined 2% in the after-market trading session yesterday, mainly due to the earnings lag and a soft earnings view for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has advanced 11.4% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 1.3%. This can primarily be attributed to its solid comps trend.Q4 HighlightsZumiez delivered earnings of 82 cents per share, which improved 10.8% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents.Zumiez Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Zumiez Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zumiez Inc. QuoteNet sales advanced 16.9% year over year to $308.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $302 million. The improvement in the top line came on the back of favorable comps, the contribution from the 53rd week, positive currency impact and 13 net new store additions since last year. Additionally, the company benefited from an adjustment to deferred revenues related to the STASH loyalty program.Quarterly comps grew 7.5%, substantially surpassing the company’s projection of 7% growth. Comps benefited from higher transaction volume, somewhat offset by a drop in dollars per transaction. This marked its sixth straight quarter of positive comps and transaction gains. Moreover, strength in the men’s, women's and footwear categories aided comps growth, partly negated by lower comps in accessories and hardgoods.The company’s robust comps performance in the quarter stemmed from the success in the holiday season. Further, top-line growth reflects significant gains from its differentiated merchandising strategies, integrated sales channels and excellent customer service.Further, the company’s positive comps trend continued in February. Comps for the four-week period ended Mar 3, 2018, escalated 9.2% against a 3.1% decline recorded a year-ago quarter. Moreover, Zumiez reported sales growth of 23.2% to $63.4 million in February.In the reported quarter, gross profit jumped 22% to about $114.7 million, while gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 37.2%. The increase can be attributed to 120 bps occupancy expense leverage, 70 bps gains from product margin and 80 bps related to the aforementioned adjustment to deferred revenues associated with the STASH loyalty program. This was partly negated by 70 bps rise in inventory shrinkage and 20 bps increase in incentive compensation.Zumiez’s selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.5% to nearly $77.7 million, while as a percentage of sales, SG&A expense expanded 20 bps to 25.2%. The higher expenses related to increased annual incentive compensation were partly offset by leverage in store operating and corporate costs.Operating income grew 32.4% year over year to $18.8 million. Moreover, operating margin expanded 130 bps to 12%.Financial UpdateAs of Feb 3, Zumiez’s cash and marketable securities were $121.9 million, up 54.7% year over year. The upside was driven by cash flow from operations, partly offset by capital expenditures. Total shareholders’ equity at the end of the quarter was $355.9 million.Further, the company generated $65.5 million as cash flow from operations in fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $24.1 million.For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates capital expenditures in a range of $21-$23 million, which will be primarily used for new store openings and planned remodels.Store UpdateIn fiscal 2017, the company opened 19 new stores, including 12 in North America, five in Europe and two in Australia. Additionally, the company closed six stores as a part of its strategy of optimizing store fleet. This brings the net store openings for fiscal 2017 to 13.As of Feb 3, 2018, the company operated a total of 698 stores, including 657 in North America, 34 in Europe and seven in Australia.In fiscal 2018, the company plans to open about 13 new stores including six in the United States, five in Europe and two in Australia. It anticipates nearly half of these openings to occur ahead of the back-to-school season.GuidanceGoing into 2018, Zumiez remains confident of delivering accelerated earnings growth for the year, backed by solid top-line and positive comps trends, margin enhancement programs, improved expense leverage and lower taxes. Additionally, the company believes that infrastructure investments, made to provide a seamless customer experience and a unique approach to merchandising, will aid both top- and bottom-line growth in 2018 and beyond.Consequently, the company projects comps to grow in the low single-digit range in fiscal 2018. However, it expects sales and earnings for the year to be impacted by the absence of the additional 53rd week compared with fiscal 2017.Further, the company expects product margins to be flat to slightly accretive in fiscal 2018. Operating profit is estimated to increase in the high single-digit range. SG&A expenses are expected to grow at a significantly slower rate than fiscal 2017, due to strong expense management and absence of increase in incentive compensation that occurred in fiscal 2017. Apart from the aforementioned gains, the company expects earnings for fiscal 2018 to benefit from the new tax reform with an effective tax rate of roughly 27%.However, the company’s guidance for first-quarter fiscal 2018 was slightly disappointing. While the company robust comps growth and sales guidance, earnings projections were discouraging.The company expects net sales for the first quarter in the $198-$202 million range, while comps growth is anticipated to be 4-6%. The company stated that monthly sales in the quarter will be impacted by the shift in Easter holiday. The shift is likely to bear a positive impact on sales for March and hurt sales in April.Consolidated operating margins are projected between negative 2.6% and negative 1.7%. At the high-end of the guidance, this reflects nearly 46% decline from first-quarter fiscal 2017. Consequently, the company projects loss per share of 13-18 cents compared with a loss of 18 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. This is likely to stem from 3 cents per share negative impact, related to the company’s inability to recognize the tax benefit on losses in certain jurisdictions within Europe.Moreover, this is estimated to negatively impact earnings per share for the second and third quarters as well. However, this should turn to be beneficial in the fourth quarter as the company generates earnings in Europe.Looking for More?

2160,GPS,"The success of billionaire value investor Warren Buffett underscores the efficiency of his investing mantra. Going by a Motley Fool article published last year, over the past 50 years, his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway’s stock has yielded a compound annual return of 20.8%. This indicates that an investment of $10,000 in 1965  is worth $88 million today.However, apparently simple to understand, this investing discipline has its own share of pitfalls. A value investor mostly misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects and in their quest of cheaper stocks, they often end up picking stocks that have weak future prospects.Buffett believes that proper understanding of the “intrinsic value” of a stock may ease out many problems with regard to value investment. According to him, going by the fundamentals of value investing while picking undervalued stocks, investors need to focus on their earnings growth potential.While yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings, sales or book value are the most common value investing matrices that can easily single out stocks trading at a discount, these ratios fail to consider the potential of a stock. PEG is the ratio with the earnings growth component in it.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential.Here are five out of the 28 stocks that qualified the screening:US Foods Holding Corp.

2161,GPS,"American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) declined nearly 9.4% on Mar 8, despite reporting accelerated sales, continued sequential margin improvement and EPS growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. While the company’s earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales topped estimates. This marked the third sales beat in the last four quarters.Moreover, American Eagle’s shares ascended 51.9% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s 23.3% growth.Q4 HighlightsQuarterly adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share rose 13% from 39 cents recorded in the prior-year quarter and were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a GAAP basis, earnings surged 73.3% year over year to 52 cents per share.American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. QuoteTotal net revenues increased around 12% year over year to $1,228.7 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,197.7 million. Moreover, this marked record sales for the company, with fourth quarter recording the best of 2017.Consolidated comps increased 8% compared with a slight increase witnessed last year. This marked the company’s strongest comps since the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Moreover, fiscal 2017 marked the third straight year of comps growth.Further, the company’s digital business continued to exhibit solid growth, improving more than 20% in the quarter. In fact, this was the company’s 12th straight quarter of double-digit e-commerce growth. Moreover, trends in brick-and-mortar stores improved as both American Eagle (AE) and Aerie stores reported positive in-store comps, increasing low single-digits.Evidently, traffic and transactions improved and store traffic surpassed mall traffic for both brands. Average unit retail price increased low-single digit on account of a favorable mix, while average dollar sales improved marginally.Brand-wise, comps rose 34% at Aerie stores, while it improved 5% at AE brand outlets. Notably, this marked aerie brand’s 15th straight quarter of positive comps.Quarter in DetailGross profit increased 9.4% to $425.1 million in the reported quarter, with the gross margin contraction of 80 basis points (bps) to 34.6%. The decline can primarily be attributed to greater promotions and increased shipping costs and compensation, partly negated by lower rent. However, the company witnessed sequential improvements from the 270 bps, 240 bps and 120 bps gross margin declines in the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Clearly, this reflected a solid reduction in gross margin erosion from 270 bps in the first quarter to 80 bps in the fourth quarter.SG&A expenses increased nearly 9% to $263.8 million, while as a percentage of sales it leveraged 60 bps to 21.5%. The rise in SG&A expenses, in dollar terms, was driven by higher store salaries, due to a strong holiday season and the extra week alongside increased incentive compensation.Furthermore, the company’s adjusted operating income was $118 million, up 10% from $107 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin also shriveled 20 bps to 9.6%.Financial PositionAmerican Eagle ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $413.6 million compared with $378.6 million in fiscal 2016. Further, total shareholders’ equity as of Feb 3 was $1,246.8 million.Moreover, the company spent $169 million as capital expenditures in fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, management anticipates capital expenditures in the range of $180-$190 million, of which roughly 50% will be spent on store openings and refurbishment. The balance will be invested in omni-channel and digital projects as well as general corporate maintenance.As of Feb 3, American Eagle’s merchandise inventory at cost was roughly $398 million, up 11% from the comparable year-ago period. The increase is attributed to the investments in bottoms, women’s tops and Aerie apparel to support strong sales trends.During 2017, the company returned nearly $176 million to shareholders by paying dividends of $89 million and buying back 6 million shares for $88 million.Backed by its strong cash position, positive free cash flow and gains from the tax reform, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to 13.75 cents per share. The increased dividend is payable on Apr 27 to shareholders with record as of Apr 13.Store UpdateDuring fiscal 2017, American Eagle inaugurated 15 new AE Brand stores, 15 stand-alone Aerie locations and 28 Aerie side-by-side stores. Moreover, the company closed 25 AE brand stores and eight stand-alone Aerie stores.As of Feb 3, the company operated a total of 1,047 stores, including 933 AE (having 116 Aerie side-by-side locations) and 109 stand-alone Aerie stores. Additionally, the company operated 214 international licensed outlets.In fiscal 2018, management intends to open 15-20 new AE outlets and 35-40 Aerie stores, including 10-15 standalone stores and balance side-by-side Aerie locations. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects to shut down 10-15 AE stores and 5-10 old format Aerie stores.Looking AheadManagement remains impressed with its quarterly performance, particularly record sales and sequential improvement in profit margins. The company expects these trends to continue in the first quarter.American Eagle anticipates comps for first-quarter fiscal 2018 to increase mid-single-digits. This is likely to result in adjusted earnings per share of 20-22 cents compared with 16 cents earned in the prior-year quarter.Looking for Some Trending Picks?

2162,GPS,"Fossil Group Inc.’s (FOSL  -  Free Report) transition to connected wearables and smartwatches has been a catalyst in raising investor’s optimism on the stock. Evidently, shares of this renowned watch and accessories brand have soared 69.2% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s rally of 28.6%. Additionally, the company has been progressing well with its online business and strategies to gain operating efficiency.However, with underlying weakness in traditional watches and other business categories, not all seem to be going well for the company. Moreover, the company’s gross margin performance has been dismal for a while.  Let’s look into some of these factors that have been affecting the company’s performance and see if its growth initiatives can offset hurdles.Wearables: The New Success Mantra for FossilDriven by increasing consumers’ demand for digitally advanced gadgets, Fossil has been making investments to broaden connected wearables portfolio. The wearables market provides the opportunity to combine fashion and technology and launch exciting products to suit consumers’ evolving needs of tech-enabled advanced connected gears. Moreover, the company is getting the advantage of Android’s popularity and Google’s technology in its watches.The growing demand for tech-savvy products is reflected from the fact that Fossil’s connected products have almost doubled in the past two years, reaching close to $300 million in size. Notably, wearables represented almost 20% of the company’s total watch sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. Further, expansion in the wearables category enabled the company’s overall watch category to grow more than 10 percentage points.  During the second half of 2017, Fossil launched close to 14 new hybrid and smartwatches across several brands. As the wearable business is expected to grow $32 billion by 2020, Fossil gears up to enrich wearables portfolio by adding new brands to its smartwatch line-up in 2018.Strong Online BusinessFossil continues to focus on expanding its digital platform and meet consumers’ growing demand for online purchasing. To this end, the company has been making several investments to improve digital marketing and drive online sales, for its website as well as other online wholesale partners. In fact, such dedicated endeavors in the e-commerce space bore favorable results during the fourth quarter of 2017.E-commerce sales soared as much as 31%. The e-commerce platform has also served as an important sales channel for the company’s wearables. Further, management is optimistic about expansion plans in the smartwatch as well as other digital offerings category and expects such moves to bolster online sales.     Other Hidden CatalystsTo further expand the company’s size and offerings, Fossil has signed various licensing agreements with several brands. With the renewal of the global licensing agreement with Michael Kors and Emporio Armani through 2024, the companies were able to expand the extensive line of watches and jewelry and explore other opportunities in the accessories category. The company also signed the global licensing agreement with Kate Spade & Company through 2025 and extended global watch licensing agreement with Diesel through 2025.Speaking of growth initiatives, Fossil’s restructuring program called the New World Fossil (initiated in 2016) deserves special mention. The program aims to transform the company, fuel efficiencies, improve margins and enhance the overall operating structure of the business to drive profitability. The company is well on track with this program, which helped it cut costs by $95 million in 2017, keeping it well-placed to achieve profit improvement target of $200 million by the end of 2019.Hurdles to CrossAlthough Fossil’s connected products have been faring well, its other business segments, particularly traditional watches, have been an aspect of worry. Consumers’ changing preferences and a tough retail landscape has been denting Fossil’s traditional watch category performance for a while.  In fact, the company’s watch sales dropped 6% (on constant-currency basis) during the fourth quarter of 2017, mainly due to sluggishness in the traditional category. Disappointingly, Fossil continues to witness a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category in 2018.Further, sales of leather products and jewelry have persistently been weak since past few quarters on account of soft demand. Well, these trends were clearly witnessed in the company’s fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein jewelry and leather business sales fell 9% and 14% (on constant-currency basis), respectively, with declines across all the broad geographical market regions. Fossil has also been witnessing lower gross margin for a year, primarily due to soft retail margins stemming from increased promotions as well as lower margins from connected products.Final ThoughtsDespite the aforementioned hurdles, we are encouraged with this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s efforts to strengthen performance. In fact, Fossil’s advancement in the wearables space is praiseworthy. Also, the company’s surging online business and savings initiatives have been yielding positive impacts. We expect such initiatives to aid the company in offsetting ongoing challenges and thereby uplift performance in the upcoming periods.Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

2164,GPS,"Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19 after the market closes. In the trailing four quarters, it had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 23.6%. In the preceding two quarters, it surpassed the consensus mark by 61.5% and 37.2%, respectively.The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Skechers will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the first quarter or not. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The company is likely to report bottom-line growth for the third straight quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 75 cents compared with 60 cents in the prior-year period. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.20 billion, reflecting more than 11.7% growth on a year-over-year basis.Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Quote Encouragingly, management had earlier projected first-quarter  net sales in the band of $1,175-$1,200 million compared with $1,072.8 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, the company anticipates earnings per share in the range of 70-75 cents. On top of it, management expects to witness stable-to-better gross margins in the first quarter.Factors at PlaySkechers’ greater emphasis on new line of products, store remodeling projects, cost containment efforts, inventory management and global distribution platform are the primary growth catalysts. Moreover, its e-commerce business has also contributed to sales growth. Notably, the company currently operates e-commerce sites in Chile, Germany and the UK, and has launched additional sites in Spain and Canada.Skechers’ international business also remains a considerable sales growth driver for the company, with Europe and China being the biggest markets outside the United States. Furthermore, it is poised to enhance its global reach in the footwear market through its distribution networks, subsidiaries and joint ventures (JVs).However, analysts remain concerned about higher selling, general & administrative expenses that may hurt the company's margin, and in turn the bottom line. Selling expenses have increased 37%, 31.6%, 32.1% and 7.4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. Following the same chronological order, general & administrative expenses have also increased 16.6%, 25.5%, 21% and 24.7%, respectively. Nonetheless, the growth rate of general & administrative expenses has decelerated sequentially.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Skechers is likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Skechers has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

2165,GPS,"Bargain hunters are back on the streets buying furniture and appliances, and dining out, as U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in the month of March, thus ending the streak of three straight declines. With strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising incomes Americans look much more confident now. Moreover, annual tax refunds are also likely to increase their propensity to consume. Clearly, consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy — is likely to remain strong in the months ahead.Retail Sales Bounce BackThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in March advanced 0.6% to $494.6 billion — following a decline of 0.1% and 0.2% registered in February and January, respectively. Analysts cited that slump in retail sales in the first two months of the year was a temporary hitch after a sturdy holiday season. Although unfavorable weather played spoilsport, Easter holiday lifted consumers’ shopping spirit.Notably, retail sales improved 4.5% from March 2017. The report suggests that sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers increased 2%, while sales at electronics & appliance stores rose 0.5%. Meanwhile, sales at food & beverage stores and receipts at restaurants witnessed growth of 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 0.8% and increased 9.7% from the prior-year period.However, receipts at gasoline stations and sales at building material dealers fell 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Sales at sporting goods, hobby, book & music stores dipped 1.8%, while at clothing shops the same fell 0.8%.This Means a Lot to RetailersPick up in retail sales is welcome news for retailers, whose fortunes depend upon consumers’ willingness to spend. A robust job market, massive tax cuts and sound economic fundamentals are likely to boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending. Certainly, favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector.For obvious reasons, retailers are the end gainers. With digital transformation in shopping, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. Moreover, National Retail Federation’s projection of an uptick in U.S. retail sales of 3.8-4.4% this year raises optimism. Additionally, the recent cut in corporate tax rate will allow retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives.Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 5%. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness year-over-year bottom-line growth of 12%, per the Earnings Preview. This fares much better than the previous quarter, where earnings climbed 3%. The top line is also projected to increase 7.6% compared with 9.7% growth registered in the preceding quarter.Wrapping UpWith earnings season all set to gather momentum it will be prudent to hold on to some retail stocks that are likely to beat estimates. These are stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

2166,GPS,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) delivered better-than-expected bottom-line results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, marking a considerable improvement from its recent trend. However, the top line continued to disappoint, lagging the estimates and declining year over year.The company’s improved bottom-line results can be attributed to the stabilization of reimbursement rates, a decline in drug purchasing costs and a record number of immunizations that enhanced pharmacy margins for the quarter.Other key highlights of the quarter were solid results at the Retail Pharmacy Segment with higher adjusted EBITDA, strong start to Pharmacy Services segment in the new commercial selling season just after the fourth quarter, completion of the sale of 1,932 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and a merger agreement with Albertsons Companies.As of Mar 27, 2018, Rite Aid completed the transfer of 1,932 stores and related assets to Walgreens for $4.157 billion. It now plans to transfer the three distribution centers and related inventory, starting Sep 1, 2018. With the cash proceeds, management has been lowering debt. As a result, its debt, net of cash, was $2.9 billion as of Mar 3, 2018.Additionally, the company agreed to merge with Albertsons on Feb 20, 2018. So far, the boards of directors of both the companies have approved the transaction and the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has expired. The companies expect to close the merger in the second half of calendar year 2018.Though the transfer of stores to Walgreens and the merger with Albertsons are positives for the stock, it has declined 31.8% in the last three months, probably because of the lack of robust operating results. Moreover, the decline in share price reflects an underperformance from the industry’s fall of 16.6%.Q4 in DetailRite Aid reported adjusted loss per share of 1 cent in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 against earnings per share of 2 cents in the year-ago quarter. However, results beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss per share of 2 cents. While the bottom line was hurt by a decline in adjusted EBITDA, higher costs relating to the Walgreens deal, and increased lease termination and impairment charges, it was negated higher LIFO credit and improved reimbursement rates.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteRevenues dropped 8.6% to $5,394.3 million, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,540 million. During the quarter, Retail Pharmacy segment revenues declined 10.1% on account of soft same-store sales and an extra week in the prior year’s fourth quarter. Moreover, revenues from the Pharmacy Services segment declined 4.3% due to changes in the composition of Medicare Part D membership and a fall in commercial business.Retail Pharmacy same-store sales dipped 1.7%, owing to 2.3% fall in pharmacy sales and 0.6% decrease in front-end sales. Pharmacy sales included a negative impact of nearly 138 basis points (bps) from the introduction of new generic drugs. Further, prescription count at comparable stores slipped 1.8% due to the omission of some pharmacy networks from the prior-year quarter. Prescription sales constituted 64.9% of total drugstore sales.Rite Aid’s adjusted EBITDA dropped about 6.1% year over year to $157.4 million while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 10 bps to 2.9%. This was due to lower adjusted EBITDA at the Pharmacy Services segment; offset by favorable results for the Retail Pharmacy segment, primarily driven by improved reimbursement rates and enhanced generic purchasing. Pro-forma adjusted EBITDA, adjusted for fees related to the Walgreens transaction and the extra week in fiscal 2017, was $173.2 million, down 4.2% year over year.Store UpdateRite Aid continues to renovate stores with 38 remodeled and six relocated outlets in the fourth quarter. This brings the company’s total wellness-stores count to 1,805. Further, it sold 1,554 stores to Walgreens and shut 19 stores during the quarter, consequently taking the total store count to 2,831 as of Mar 3, 2018. Additionally, store count related to continuing operations were 1,651 and 2,550, respectively, for wellness stores and total stores.Financial StatusRite Aid ended fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $447.3 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $3,340.1 million and total shareholders’ equity of $1,601 million.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s cash from operating activities was $87 million as of the end of fiscal 2018.OutlookFollowing the strong closure of fiscal 2018, Rite Aid outlined its initial view for fiscal 2019. Going forward, the company anticipates benefiting from generic drug purchasing efficiencies, a stable reimbursement-rate environment than witnessed in fiscal 2018, TSA fees related to the Walgreens deal as well as other initiatives to grow sales and drive operational efficiencies. However, the company’s guidance does not include any impact of the pending transaction with Albertsons.Rite Aid estimates sales of $21.7-$22.1 billion in fiscal 2019 with comps anticipated in the range of flat-to-up 1%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be $615-$675 million. Further, the company expects net loss of $40-$95 million in fiscal 2019. Adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of 2-6 cents compared with a loss per share of 2 cents reported in fiscal 2018. Additionally, it expects capital expenditures of nearly $250 million in fiscal 2019.Still Interested in the Retail Space? Check TheseInvestors can count on The Gap Inc.

2167,GPS,"Earnings season is all set to gather momentum and its time you look beyond U.S.-China trade dispute, Facebook data breach and apprehensions about three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year. Given strong economic fundamentals and lower corporate tax rate, the reporting cycle is likely to be a favorable one. Notably, per the latest Earnings Outlook, total earnings for the S&P 500 index is expected to rise 16% in the first quarter of 2018 versus 13.5% in the preceding quarter.Among the 16 Zacks categorized sectors, we are focusing on Retail-Wholesale today, which typically performs well in a maturing economic cycle. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness year-over-year bottom-line growth of 12%, per the Earnings Outlook. Notably, this fares much better than the previous quarter, where earnings climbed 3%.With unemployment rate still at 17-year low, consumer spending being favorable and government expenditure increasing, things appear to be fairly rosy for the U.S. economy. Notably, a strengthening labor market may lead to gradual wage acceleration, and in turn boost consumer confidence. All these sound constructive for retailers.We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. We note that consumer spending inched up 0.2% in February, following an equal rise in January. Meanwhile, personal income surged $67.3 billion or 0.4% in February, marking the third straight month of a similar percentage increase. All these factors paint a bright picture for retailers, who are also benefiting from the corporate tax rate cut.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonAll said, we used the Zacks methodology and identified retail stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat earnings estimates this reporting cycle. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.

2169,GPS,"Retail REIT Kite Realty Group Trust (KRG  -  Free Report) has announced the opening of Nordstrom Rack at Portofino Shopping Center in Houston, TX (MSA). The move is aimed at enhancing shoppers’ experience at this property with high-quality merchandising mix.Specifically, with the occupation of 27,252 square feet of space at this shopping center, Nordstrom Rack joins the cohort of several existing anchors like T.J. Maxx of The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report), DSW Inc. (DSW  -  Free Report), Old Navy of Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and others.Notably, the Portofino Shopping Center, which is located 30 miles north of downtown Houston in the suburban community of Shenandoah, comes under Kite Realty’s Redevelopment, Repurpose and Reposition (3-R) initiative. The property is slated to benefit from the recent addition of the 13,000 square feet of space which resulted from the construction of two new stand-alone buildings.With the addition of Nordstrom Rack, the above-mentioned property becomes well poised to draw decent traffic from its affluent neighborhood. In fact, it is close to The Woodlands which has occupied a place in the Top 50 Best Selling Master Planned Communities in the nation.However, retail REITs have been suffering as mall traffic continues to shrink amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference to e-retail, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Such an environment has led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified. In addition, when there are substantial store closures in the middle of the lease term, not only are mall landlords hurt but tenants occupying space in the mall are equally affected because their shop visits depend on the mix of specific types of retailers.Retail REITs are countering these challenges and making concerted efforts to give their properties a facelift through redevelopment, repositioning and improving merchandising mix in an attempt to attract customers. Nevertheless, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and is hence likely to limit growth in the profit margins of retail REITs in the near term.Kite Realty is also likely to feel the brunt in the near future. In fact, in the past three months, its shares have declined 23.3% which is wider than its industry’s descend of 10.9%. Currently the stock has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Moreover, the company’s direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, accounting for nearly 34% of the net sales and recording 18% increase in comparable sales.The company remains encouraged by comps performance that benefited from the rise in traffic and conversion. Notably, positive traffic trends improved sequentially from the third quarter.

This marks more than double operating income growth for the quarter. Despite the lower gross margins, the increase in operating income is attributed to significant expense leverage during the quarter.FinancialsAbercrombie ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $675.6 million and gross borrowings under its term loan agreement of $253.3 million. As of Feb 3, 2018, inventories were $424.4 million, up 6% from the prior-year period.On Feb 23, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share on the Class A Common Stock.

Further, the company expects to maintain its disciplined approach to expense management to drive top- and bottom-line growth.For fiscal 2018, both comps and sales are projected to be up low-single digits.

2175,GPS,"DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) has been a good investment choice for quite a while now, with shares showing solid momentum. This stock’s momentum can be mostly attributed to the company’s progress on strategic initiatives which aided bottom-line beat in recent quarters.Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surged 6.7% in the past month, against the industry’s decline of 2.3%. Moreover, the stock has returned a solid 41.1% in the last six months, indicative of the positive sentiment.However, we cannot ignore the near-term headwinds that may bother the stock’s growth. These mainly include the softness in hunting and electronic categories as well as the continued decline of margins. That said, let’s analyze why we should retain the stock at this time.Strategic Initiatives Drive Stock’s MomentumDICK’S Sporting has been the prime beneficiary of its strategic actions which continually focus on generating greater sales. Apart from strengthening store network, the company remains on track to expand the e-commerce business. Notably, e-commerce penetration improved 19% of net sales from 17.9% in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, e-commerce sales grew 9% year over year, driven by its first successful holiday season on the new web platform.As part of the long-term plan, the company plans to make significant investments in e-commerce, technology, store payroll, Team Sports HQ and private brands. This reinforces its confidence in driving market share growth in fiscal 2018. Further, these endeavors are likely to enrich customers’ experience and augment the top line.Focus on MerchandisingDICK’S Sporting is progressing well with its merchandising strategy (announced in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016), which is all about optimizing inventory to make shelves available for popular- and private-label brands. Further, it plans to invest in the supply chain to improve in-stock levels and speed-up delivery. These investments will not only improve customer satisfaction and inventory turnover but also boost merchandise margin rates.Robust Earnings Trend & OutlookDICK’S Sporting’s aforementioned initiatives significantly aided earnings performance as is evident from the robust surprise history. It delivered second straight positive earnings surprise in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Moreover, it topped estimates for the sixth time in the last eight quarters. Results gained from strengthening of Team Sports, footwear, outdoor equipment and private-brands businesses alongside solid e-commerce growth.DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. QuoteGoing into 2018, the company expects greater product innovation from its key partners and expansion of the private brands business to ease margin pressures. Further, it plans to make significant investments in the business as it remains confident about the long-term potential and tremendous opportunities in the evolving industry. For fiscal 2018, management projects earnings of nearly $2.83 per share.Estimates Trend UpThe aforementioned positivity on the stock is further justified by the positive estimate revisions witnessed in a month’s span. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2018 climbed 6 cents and 14 cents, respectively, to 43 cents per share and $2.91 per share. Moreover, estimates for fiscal 2019 reflect a gain of 5 cents to $3.10 per share.Near-Term HurdlesThough the company’s bottom-line performance has been impressive, top line lagged estimates in the last reported quarter due to soft comparable store sales (comps). Additionally, continued softness in the hunting and electronic categories has been perils for top-line growth. Further, the company expects the hunting and firearm, as well as electronics businesses, to experience headwinds throughout 2018, which will hurt the top line. The hunting and firearm business will continue to be impacted by the recent changes to the company’s firearm policies while the electronics business will be hurt by reduced exposure.Moreover, the company’s margins continue to be strained due to shrinking sales and increased promotions among others. Going forward, the company expects greater product innovation from its key partners and further expansion of its private brands business to lower margin pressures than previously anticipated. However, the company still expects margins to remain negative.Looking for More Promising Picks?

2177,GPS,"Taking a break from the hot U.S.-China friction headlines, here we bring for you an interesting observation on how apparel retailing has been adapting well to e-commerce and omni-channel techniques.Looking almost a year back and before, the apparel retail segment witnessed a setback due to the evolving trends in the retail industry as smart phones started becoming the primary avenue to make purchases. From then, there has been a revolutionary change in the business models of most apparel and accessories retailers as these strive to provide the best customer experience and keep pace with industry trends.Transformation Takes ChargeTo put it simply, there has been a sea change in consumer preferences as to when, where, how and why to shop. To catch up with this new consumer behavior, the retail industry has undergone a huge transformation where online and brick-and-mortar goes hand in hand to deliver upon customers demands.Well, this transformation is true for the Retail – Apparel and Shoes industry as well, which forms a key segment of the retail sector. Today, apparel retailing is not confined to stores. In fact, a major part of the total apparel sale in the United States comes from online. This is the reason apparel retailers have been rolling out new omni-channel and digital capabilities to attract customers.Some traits prevalent across the apparel industry are increased investments in the multi-channel growth strategy, where players are keen on improving merchandise offerings, developing IT infrastructure to enhance web and mobile experiences, renovating and expanding physical stores, as well as enabling speedy delivery to customers.Further, companies are focused on inventory management initiatives to provide the right merchandise at the right time and place. Another area that these companies are working on is customer loyalty programs that can aid in boosting the loyalty score.Digital Investments – The Key to GrowthThe efforts and investments in digital growth have been well reflected in the top and bottom-line performances of the players in the specialty apparel segment. Digital sales have been the prime contributing factor in the top-line growth of most retailers in the space. Additionally, this has led to a revival in the comparable store sales (comps) trend for these retailers. Looking ahead, the use of artificial intelligence and providing customized products is likely to be the winning strategy for retailers vying for the top spot.Given these efforts, the graph of the Retail – Apparel and Shoes industry has witnessed 4.4% growth in the past year.As per National Retail Federation (NRF), total retail sales increased 4.4% year over year in February and 0.3% from January. This included a 10.5% increase in online and other non-store retail sales. Moreover, sales for the clothing and clothing accessories segment alone increased 5.2% year over year in February.That said, let’s take a look at some individual stocks from the industry, throwing light on their growth endeavors and the resulting benefits.Apparel Stocks Focused on Digital GrowthStarting with The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), we note that it has been making constant efforts to boost digital and mobile offerings, alongside improving product acceptance. Notably, the company has increased online presence across all of its brands, and its online division is one of its most profitable, posting double-digit sales growth. Recently, the company announced plans to launch the “buy online, pick-up in-store” service, a new personalization engine that is powered by customer data, and continued significant investment in its omni-channel services. Backed by these efforts, the company has delivered positive earnings and sales surprises in the trailing four and five quarters, respectively. Additionally, the stock surged 26.6% in the past year. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Abercrombie & Fitch Company (ANF  -  Free Report) has been a prime beneficiary of the growth in digital era as it has made a significant progress in expanding digital presence, augmenting its direct-to-consumer and omni-channel capabilities. The company’s investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment have significantly aided the growth of the direct-to-consumer (DTC) business, which delivered double-digit growth in both the United States and international markets in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Overall, the DTC business accounted for nearly 34% of net sales in the fourth quarter, recording an 18% increase in comparable sales. In fiscal 2018, the company plans to continue investing in DTC capabilities, alongside bringing innovations in this channel, using customer insights and data analytics.Driven by these efforts, the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in three straight and a sales beat in the trailing four quarters. Further, the company’s comps improved sequentially throughout fiscal 2017. Consequently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has witnessed whopping 152.4% growth in the past year.Pittsburgh, PA-based American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) has witnessed grave recovery in its comps driven by strong growth in online sales that stems from the efficient use of omni-channel capabilities to enhance customer experience. Notably, the company’s comps have improved in the last 12 quarters and for three consecutive years now. In an effort to develop its omni-channel platform, American Eagle is not only enhancing its digital presence but also investing in its store fleet. Consequently, digital sales improved more than 20% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 and trends improved in brick-and-mortar stores as both AE and Aerie stores reported positive in-store comps. This was the company’s 12th straight quarter of double-digit e-commerce growth. This makes it clear that a winning marketing strategy in retail is providing the best combination of digital and physical store experiences. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 stock surged 57.2% in the past year.Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) seems to be enhancing market share via persistent store expansion and strengthening capabilities through further investments, particularly in digital growth. This has been significantly boosting its top-line and comps performance. This Zacks Rank #2 company continues to efficiently allocate a major portion of its capital toward its multichannel growth strategy. It also makes regular amendments to its clearance strategy in order to better manage its inventories, keep up with customer demands and provide them with a better shopping experience. Also, we believe that the price integrity initiatives undertaken by the company will help in building a healthy relationship with customers, thereby enhancing customer loyalty.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2178,GPS,"Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Mar 1. The company has been progressing well backed by its solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Apparently, the company has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three consecutive quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average beat of 10.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 59 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15.7%. Also, the estimate has moved up by a penny in the last seven days. Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors at PlayGap remains committed toward its growth strategy, which mainly focuses on the Old Navy and Athleta brands. The company, which had reported growth in comparable-store sales (comps) in the preceding four quarters owing to Old Navy’s robust performance, is likely to continue the momentum in the fourth quarter.Earlier, management had stated that comps reflected strength for the fiscal fourth quarter owing to persistent momentum at key areas of the company’s business. For fiscal 2017, comps are anticipated to grow in low-single digits versus previous projection of flat to marginal improvement.Moreover, comps performance buoyed Gap’s top line, delivering fourth straight beat in the fiscal third quarter. Encouragingly, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,667 million in the quarter under review, up nearly 5.4% year over year. Markedly, the consensus estimates for the Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic brands are pegged at $2,118 million, $1,610 million and $713 million, respectively, representing year-over-year increases of 20.5%, 21.8% and 28%.Also, Gap’s solid strategic efforts are well reflected in the company’s share price movement. In a year’s time, the stock surged 31% substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.5%.Furthermore, Gap continues to focus on boosting its digital and mobile offerings, omni-channel capabilities as well as enhancing its footprint in the value and active space. Backed by these initiatives and a sturdy performance in the nine months of fiscal 2017, management raised outlook for the year as well. For fiscal 2017, Gap envisions adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.08-$2.12, up from $2.02-$2.10 projected earlier.However, Gap’s significant international presence exposes it to adverse currency fluctuations, which might adversely impact the company’s top and bottom lines. In the third-quarter, currency headwinds impacted the bottom-line growth by nearly 3 percentage points.  What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Gap is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

2179,GPS,"From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart Stores (WMT  -  Free Report), retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. Improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer confidence points to an uptick in sales during this festive season, and retail bellwethers will leave no opportunity to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers will go the extra mile.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers. Market experts asserted that while recent hurricanes resulted in short-term derailment in the economic activity, a lift in the later part of the year remains on the cards. Since Christmas is falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day than last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.What Do Holiday Numbers Unveil?With the ability and willingness seen in consumers to spend more, retailers could hear their cash registers jingle this time. Data compiled by the nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.According to Deloitte, sales during the holiday season are likely to increase in the band of 4-4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%. The data unveiled by Kantar suggests that sales during the fourth-quarter holiday period is expected to jump 3.7%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Retailers such as Macy’s, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) are bracing up for this year’s race and have announced hiring plans for the upcoming holiday season to meet the holiday rush. Per media reports, Target intends to employ 100,000 associates, while Macy's will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers to handle the rush. Meanwhile, Gap is deploying seasonal associates at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada. J. C. Penney will hire nearly 40,000 seasonal workers.Be Hawk-Eyed The holiday season is nothing less than a battlefield for the retailers fighting hard to win over consumers and with technology playing a major role they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra. Companies will go the extra mile — offering discounts or indulging in promotional activities — to trap the bargain hunters. But we wonder whether these will come at the price of margins, not to say the impact on the bottom line.Wal-Mart is making huge investments in e-commerce initiatives. The company’s acquisitions of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com are in sync with its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Also, the company partnered with Alphabet’s Google to enable shopping through Google Express using voice-activated service. Target has been also focusing on developing its online business. Recently, it waged war against other retail big-wigs by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items and launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores.Bottom LineWe believe that with the advent of the holiday season, the retail sector will hog all the attention. So, how about betting your bucks on these lucrative options? Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart, Target and Gap carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Macy’s and J. C. Penney has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The upside was backed by comps growth of 3%, as against a 1% decline in the year-ago period.Meanwhile, comps continued to gain from robust Old Navy performance that was fueled by improved traffic.

The figure was offset by flat merchandise margins.Operating income fell 2.8% to $378 million with operating margin contracting 40 bps to 9.8%. Also, the adjusted operating margin contracted 120 bps due to higher adjusted operating expenses. These expenses stemmed from greater marketing as well as payroll costs, along with investments in digital and customer service initiatives.FinancialsGap ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,353 million, long-term debt of $1,248 million, and total stockholders’ equity of $3,024 million.During the nine months of the current year, the company generated cash flow from operations of $600 million and incurred capital expenditures of $463 million.

2184,GPS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Gap has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.1,  as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.8x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Gap’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months. Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Gap has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 14.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Gap stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Gap has a P/S ratio of about 0.9. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Gap currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Gap a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Gap might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of A. This gives GPS a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been favorable. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight up and no down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 18.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 6.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Gap, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus   Gap, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineGap is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 25% of more than 250 industries) instills investor optimism. However, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large, as you can see below:We believe, despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance, a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Gap.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2186,GPS,"Benchmarks closed in the red on Thursday after President Trump said that new tariffs will be imposed on aluminum and steel imports by the U.S. next week. After this development, all the three key indexes started this month with heavy losses following concerns over a possible trade war and aggravated worries over higher inflation.The market’s fear gauge rose to its highest level since early February, moving above 20. A reading above 20 is considered alarming and indicates that the broader market is in turmoil. All the three indexes continued to decline for three consecutive trading days with the Dow down 0.4% for the year. However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are still up 0.4% and 4%, respectively, for 2018.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.7%, or 428.21 points, to close at 24,608.98. The S&P 500 fell 1.4% to close at 2,677.67. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,180.56, losing 1.3%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 11.7% to close at 22.17. A total of 9 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 8.4 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.47-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.42-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets Stumbles for Three Straight DaysOn Thursday, President Trump said the U.S. will announce new tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports next week. He added that this move will come as the U.S. will be “going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back.” Following this announcement, fears of a possible retaliation from countries like China and Canada and the European Union heightened. Additionally, worries over inflation arose following this development as such tariffs might lead to an increase in prices of imports. This in turn may raise the overall price level. Investors switched from equities to bonds on Thursday, following which bond prices increased. Rise in bond prices weighed on the yield of 10-year Treasury note, which fell from 2.870% Wednesday to 2.802% on Thursday, its worst fall in six months.The Dow lost more than 420 points on Thursday. For the S&P 500 index, 10 of the 11 sectors finished in the red with industrials and financials emerging as the biggest drag on the S&P 500. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) decreased 2%, becoming the worst performer among the S&P 500 sectors. Consumers of steel and aluminum registered sharp declines following Trump’s announcement of new tariffs. Dow components, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) fell 3.3%, 3.5% and 1.8%, respectively.Additionally, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) declined 1.8% and was the second biggest loser among the key S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings including, Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) slumped 2.4% and 1.8%, respectively. Both the companies have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, The Gap, Inc. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.2. If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock, the current level puts GPS among its lows over the past five years. This suggests that the stock is undervalued compared to its own historical levels and thus it could prove to be a suitable entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with its sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 27.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that The Gap, Inc. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 12.4 so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, The Gap, Inc. has a P/S ratio of about 0.71. This is lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now.If anything, GPS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, The Gap, Inc. currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘A’, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes The Gap, Inc. a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though The Gap, Inc. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name.

2190,GPS,"Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) has started off early to make most of the holiday season, the busiest part of the year. In fact, the company has begun inviting applications for seasonal associate positions at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada. The hiring events will be organized at all concerned stores on Sep 23, 2017.Candidates may choose to apply for all positions through the company’s online seasonal hiring career page prior commencement of the hiring event. Applications for seasonal positions for Athleta stores will also be accepted through its career page.Regarding the recruitment, there will be open positions for a wide range of services including facing customers at any of its brands’ stores, handling great volumes of calls at its call centers, and coordinating shipments from the distribution centers to its stores as well as to customers buying online or in store.The company’s early start of preparations for the holiday season reminds of a popular saying, “Well begun is half done.” While the holiday season is away, Gap is among the few retailers that have taken initial steps to make this year’s shopping fest a success.Markedly, holiday season is a crucial time for retailers marking the greatest selling period of the year. At this time, retailers are on their toes flooding the market with offers and promotions. Early-hour store openings, huge discounts and numerous other promotional strategies are key highlights of the season.Amid the current challenging retail landscape, the holiday season is likely to bring an opportunity for retailers to improve its comparable-store sales by increasing footfall at its stores, and in turn boost overall profitability.Hiring of seasonal workers is a common plan for retailers at this time, expecting to reach out to more customers as well as providing world-class shopping experience. Hence, Gap is leaving no stone unturned to make the most of this season and offer superior service to its patrons.Gap’s New StrategyGap recently outlined a promising new strategy focused on its two growth brands, discount juggernaut Old Navy and Athleta. The company expects net sales of more than $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, at each of the brands over the next few years, with these gains coming as a result of U.S. store expansion as well as mobile and e-commerce growth.Additionally, the company plans to open 270 Old Navy and Athleta stores while simultaneously closing 200 underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores over the next three years.In fact, Gap customers are likely aware that the retailer has steadily increased its online presence across all of its brands, and its online division is one of its most profitable, posting double-digit sales growth.Along with store expansion, Gap is expected to launch a buy online, pick-up in store service, a new personalization engine that is powered by customer data, and continued significant investment in its omni-channel services.Going forward, the company hopes that these new strategies might create about $500 million in expense savings over the next three years. Furthermore, it plans to reinvest a portion of those savings in its growth goals.Notably, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 19.5% in the past month, comfortably outperforming the industry’s gain of 2%. Also, the stock boasts a VGM Score of A, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 8%, which looks appeasing.Three Retail Stocks in the LimelightBetter-ranked stocks in the same industry include Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

2191,GPS,"Yes, you read that title right. While the overarching narrative surrounding the retail industry may be to “get out now because retail is dying,” there are still some companies out there that are worth taking a long, hard look at.One of the biggest factors impacting retailers, of course, is e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). Having become much more than just an online bookseller, Amazon has grown to be a digital one-stop shop for almost everything these days. But there are certain markets that Amazon hasn’t completely dominated, and retailers operating in these particular corners of the industry are thriving.Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report), for instance, is one of the hottest retailers, if not stocks, out there right now. Its in-store and online sales continually grow quarter after quarter, and the company has built a loyal customer base through its rewards program.The retail industry may be struggling, but it’s not dead yet. Let’s take a look at 3 retail stocks investors should consider for their portfolio.1. Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report)Lululemon is a yoga-inspired athletic apparel company that has become a leader in the fitness world since its founding in 1998. The company makes a number of different types of athletic wear for women, men, and kids, and while it operates in the ultra-competitive “athleisure” market, Lulu has been able to stay on top because of its luxe status and loyal customer base.In its most recent quarter, Lulu surprised investors with an all-around impressive report. Both the top and bottom line beat analyst estimates and improved year-over-year, and these positive results were driven by the company’s continued product innovation. For instance, customers have been flocking to Lulu’s $98 Enlite Bra, and the brand’s increasing appeal to men are both benefits that help set the company apart from competitors Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Gap’s (GPS  -  Free Report) Athleta.Looking ahead, Lulu expects earnings growth of 12.4% for the current year, with 15 analysts revising their estimates upwards in the last 30 days compared to none lower; sales are expected to grow about 10.3% in the same time frame. With a P/E of over 25, Lulu is not cheap. Investors, though, have always been willing to pay more for a stock because of perceived stature, and Lululemon is in the upper echelons of athletic wear. What’s more, LULU is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).2. Tilly’s (TLYS  -  Free Report)Tilly’s is a popular teen retailer based in Irvine, California, and is known for its trendy, SoCal-inspired clothing and accessories geared towards surfing, skateboarding, and snowboarding. Similar to rival Zumiez , Tilly’s sells brands like Adidas Originals (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Vans, RVCA, Billabong, Hurley, and Converse, among many others.Tilly’s has been a strong performer since its better-than-expected second quarter earnings, having gained roughly 34% since it beat both top and bottom line estimates. In particular, comparable store sales, which includes e-commerce, increased 2.1%, a noticeable increase from the 0.9% growth seen in the year-ago quarter. Tilly’s smartly marketed to the back-to-school crowd, highlighting popular brands that teenagers covet and showing investors that the company knows and understands its core customer.A #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Tilly’s is looking at almost 20% earnings growth for the current year, with about 1.2% sales growth in same time period. Its P/E of nearly 21 comes in well above the Retail-Apparel and Shoes industry, a reflection both of Tilly’s perception among investors and its popularity with its teen customers. While its steep drop in valuation over the last year shows how skeptical investors became in teen retailers, and retail overall, Tilly’s looks to be on the rebound.3. Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report)Originally known as Burlington Coat Factory, Burlington Stores is a leading off-price retailer. It sells everything from women’s ready-to-wear apparel, menswear, youth apparel, baby products, footwear, accessories, and home goods.Since the financial crisis nearly a decade ago, discount chains like Burlington have thrived, in part because it is a company that knows its customer--and that customer likes the thrill of a treasure hunt--but the retailer has also adapted to meet the demands of its core base over the years.Its earnings results have reflected these changes, and it has worked in Burlington’s favor. Last quarter, the discount chain continued its upbeat performance in fiscal 2017, surging past top and bottom line estimates; comps grew 3.5%, marking the 18th straight quarter of growth in this category.Sitting at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Burlington plans on focusing more on its home, beauty, and women’s apparel categories, in addition to opening 37 net new stores. The retailer expects earnings growth of almost 30% for the current year, with sales increasing 8.8% in the same time frame. Since early 2016, BURL has consistently traded above the S&P 500. Its current P/E of right around 21 is a reflection of the rise of off-price retailers, and the high-value placed on these companies right now in the retail space.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2192,GPS,"Instead of losing sleep over the uncertainties plaguing the market at the moment and making desperate attempts at finding a direction, investors should follow the footsteps of Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing.""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.""- Benjamin Graham.Investor sentiment is often swayed by breaking news and headlines, keeping the stock market in its thrall. At present, the devastating hurricanes Irma and Harvey along with geopolitical tension between the United States and North Korea are keeping Wall Street at edge. Investor worries were also heightened following the news that fund managers view the U.S. stock market as the most overvalued in the world. Further, analysts believe that due to the severe impact of hurricane Irma and Harvey Federal Reserve may restrain itself from raising interest rate for the rest of this year.Despite the aforementioned factors, the recent domestic data provided somewhat respite to investors. Per the commerce department, the U.S. economy expanded at a faster rate than initially expected. Further, increase in retail sales, Consumer Confidence and consumer spending supported by a favorable jobs scenario, indicates that the economy might do well in the second half of 2017.Where to Put Your Money?Now the most important question that arises is where should investors put their money in present situation?  We believe investors can do well by seeking refuge in less risky stocks. We suppose investing in value stocks could actually be a safer bet at this moment, given their inclination for steady growth and momentum in price.Value investing offers a break for entering the market and capturing stocks that have otherwise been overlooked by a majority of investors. A value stock may have a high dividend yield, low price-to-book ratio, low price-to-earnings ratio or a low price-to-sales ratio.Our ChoicesIt might be difficult for one to look at each parameter and compare with the peer group for an analysis on whether the stock is attractive from the value perspective. To make the task easy, Zacks has designed the new Style Style Score System.The attractiveness of a stock as an investment option is confirmed by its Value Style Score of A or B. The Value Style Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of ‘value traps’ and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a solid Zacks Rank #1 or 2 and Value Style Score of A.Rush Enterprises, Inc. (RUSHA  -  Free Report) has emerged as a strong contender with a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% and a Value Score of A.

2193,GPS,"A glimpse of L Brands, Inc.’s (LB  -  Free Report) share price movement reveals that it has plunged roughly 24% in the past six months. The stock has decreased nearly 6.6% in a month, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.2%.So what is behind the debacle? We have tried to ascertain major reasons that can be held responsible for this Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell) stock’s dismal show in the bourses.Declining CompsMajor chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping. L Brands continues to disappoint investors with soft comparable sales (comps) performance so far in the year. This specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products reported 4% drop in comps for the month of August, following declines of 7%, 9%, 7%, 5%, 10%,13% and 4% in July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively.L Brands continues to face short-term challenges due to its decision to exit the swimwear category, which according to analysts has failed to generate desired results. Management expects comps to decline in low-single digits in September. The company projects comps (excluding Victoria's Secret swim and apparel) in the third quarter to be in the range of flat to down low-single digit. For fiscal 2017, the company envisions comps to be down low-to-mid-single digits.Waning Top & Bottom LinesL Brands dwindling top and bottom-line results remain the primary concern for investors. A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2017 unveils that net sales declined 7% and 5% in the first and second quarter, respectively. Maintaining the same chronological order, we note that earnings per share fell 44% and 31%, respectively. Moreover, the second quarter marked the fourth straight when the company’s top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Management now projects earnings in the band of $3.00-$3.20 per share for fiscal 2017, down from the prior view of $3.10-$3.40 and also well below fiscal 2016 and 2015 earnings of $3.74 and $3.99, respectively. Moreover, the company envisions third-quarter earnings in the range of 25-30 cents, compared with prior-year quarter earnings of 42 cents.As a result, analysts polled by Zacks have also tweaked their estimates. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 and $3.18 for fiscal 2017 and 2018 has declined 10 cents and 13 cents, respectively. Moreover, for the third quarter the same has dropped 8 cents to 29 cents.Gross Margin Continues to HurtGross margin has shown constant deceleration in the past few quarters. In first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted 320 and 120 basis points (bps) to 37.1% and 37.3%, respectively primarily due to buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage. We noted that gross margin have contracted 230 bps, 190 bps, 180 bps and 170 bps in the fourth, third, second, and first quarters of fiscal 2016 to 43.3%, 39.7%, 38.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Further, management anticipates gross margin to deteriorate year over year during the third quarter as well as fiscal 2017.Bottom LineUndoubtedly, aforementioned factors are enough to unnerve investors. Nevertheless, L Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. The company is focusing on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise, and speed-to-market initiatives.Can’t Get Over Retail?

2194,GPS,"A glimpse of Skechers USA Inc.’s (SKX  -  Free Report) share price movement unveils that it has fallen nearly 6% in the past three months wider than the industry’s decline of 2.4%. Let’s delve deeper and find out what is troubling this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Why is the Stock Struggling?Disappointing Bottom-Line PerformanceInvestors remain apprehensive about Skechers’ bottom-line performance that has been declining for the past five straight quarters due to rise in selling and general & administrative expenses. Earnings per share have declined 20.8% and 4.8% in the second and first quarters of 2017, respectively, and 78.9%, 2.3% and 7.7% in the fourth, third and second quarters of 2016, respectively.The company had also witnessed negative earnings surprises in four of the five trailing quarters, including 13.6% registered in the second quarter of 2017. The Manhattan Beach, CA-based company delivered quarterly earnings of 38 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. In the preceding four quarters, it had underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 19.2%.Bleak Earnings ProjectionManagement projected third-quarter earnings per share in the range of 42-47 cents that was below the consensus mark. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed a downtrend. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55 and $1.99 for 2017 and 2018 has declined by 23 cents and 1 cent, respectively, in the past 60 days. Moreover, the same has plunged 14 cents to 43 cents for the third quarter.Are the Remedies Sufficient?Greater emphasis on the new line of products, corporate upgrades and store remodeling projects, cost containment efforts, inventory management along with global distribution platform may help lift Skechers performance. The company's domestic e-commerce business continues to register sales growth. It currently operates e-commerce sites in Chile, Germany and U.K., and has launched additional sites in Spain and Canada. Management projects third-quarter 2017 net sales in the band of $1.050–$1.075 billion compared with $942.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter.The company is transitioning international distributors to subsidiary or Joint Venture (JV) model. Its Israel and South Korea distributors have been transitioned to JVs. The company’s JVs in Asia are exhibiting improvement. Skechers’ international wholesale business revenues, which constituted 35.1% of total sales, advanced 18.6% during the second quarter of 2017 on the back of a 19.4% rise in wholly-owned subsidiary and JV businesses and 16.1% growth in distributor business. The company’s JV business registered growth of 62.4% for the quarter buoyed by double-digit growth in China and sales from South Korea.We believe that the blend of ample liquidity and innovative products, positions Skechers to capitalize on future growth opportunities.3 Retail Stocks Hogging the LimelightIf you are interested in the retail space you can consider stocks such as G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

2196,GPS,"Big 5 Sporting Goods Inc. (BGFV  -  Free Report) stock continues its bull run despite reporting lower-than-anticipated sales results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 while providing a soft outlook. The sales decline stemmed from an extremely challenging performance in December. Sales in December were largely hurt by nearly 50% decrease in core winter-product categories due to warmer-than-normal and dry weather conditions in most of its markets. Lower demand for firearm-related products also hurt the quarterly sales.However, the company’s upside story mainly relates to the positive earnings surprise trend and commitment to enhancing customer experience through store expansion and effective merchandising strategies. Consequently, shares of Big 5 Sporting rallied 16.3% in the past month, against the industry’s decline of 1.2%.Let’s find out more about the growth drivers for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Store Growth & Technological AdvancementBig 5 Sporting leverages an extensive network of stores to effectively penetrate into target markets, directed toward generating healthy sales and capturing market shares. The company has been focusing on expanding its store base and introducing technological advancements to enhance services for its patrons. Big 5 Sporting expects to open eight new stores and close three in 2018. We believe these moves will place it well for future growth.Effective Merchandising Aid MarginsBig 5 Sporting’s unique strategy of offering exclusive branded merchandise, sourced from leading manufacturers provides it with a competitive edge over its rivals in a cut-throat specialty retailing industry. Further, the company leverages strong vendor relationships to source overstock and closeout merchandise at substantial discounts. This helps it achieve the dual objectives of boosting gross margin while offering compelling value to customers.Inventories Look GoodAdditionally, the company’s merchandise strategy helped it retain solid inventory position. At the end of fiscal 2017, inventories remained in good shape despite soft sales of winter-related products in the fiscal fourth quarter. Inventories improved 6.7% in the quarter. However, the excess inventory is not likely to impact the transition to the next season as the company deals with non-fashion products, which should play well next year.Shareholder RewardsBig 5 Sporting remains committed toward enhancing shareholder returns, as evident from its regular practice of returning value to stockholders in forms of dividends and share buybacks. It recently announced a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share that was paid on Mar 23. Moreover, the company repurchased 795,718 shares for nearly $7.7 million in 2017. As of Dec 31, 2017, it had about $15.7 million remaining to be repurchased under its $25-million share buyback program.Looking for Trending Retail Picks?

2197,GPS,"Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) is climbing up the chart, thanks to its robust earnings trend in recent quarters. Though the company reported a mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, its earnings beat trend remained intact. This marked its fourth straight bottom-line beat. Further, sales were in line and improved year over year, backed by gains in the apparel business driven by strong e-commerce growth, favorable weather and focus on sportswear.The cumulative effect of the recent results is visible in the stock’s 15.8% growth in the last three months against the industry’s decline of 9.9%. Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company rallied 7.8% since reporting earnings on Mar 16.Though solid earnings trend is the clear driver behind the recent momentum of the stock, let’s analyze some more factors that are acting as catalysts.Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hibbett Sports, Inc. QuoteGrowth CatalystsHibbett remains well positioned to gain from the growth of omni-channel capabilities, improved Rewards members, and small market strategy and inventory management initiatives. The company is on track with the internal initiatives, including improving e-commerce penetration and expanding its loyalty program. It remains focused on expanding customer base by connecting with more customers through e-commerce and selective store expansion. Notably, e-commerce sales accounted for nearly 7.6% of total sales in the fourth quarter.Further, Hibbett continued to witness strong results from the re-launch of the loyalty program in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, new member sign-ups improved 45% year over year while total member revenues increased 24%. Consequently, its rewards program contributed 57% to net sales.Going forward, the company will continue to focus on omni-channel growth in fiscal 2019. Alongside, it remains keen on store expansion and inventory management initiatives. It is also gaining from small market strategy as it continues to strengthen presence across the country.Consequently, the company reiterated its target of growing to over 1,500 stores in underserved markets. In fiscal 2018, it opened 44 new stores, expanded 11 high-performing outlets and closed 43 underperforming ones. With this, it operated 1,079 stores in 35 states as of Feb 3, 2018. As part of its efforts to improve store productivity, the company expects to close 50-60 underperforming stores in fiscal 2018. Additionally, it plans to open 30-35 new stores in the fiscal.Additionally, the company is stringently working on inventory management initiatives despite a challenging environment. It expects the small market strategy, along with the growth of omni-channel capabilities, to enrich customers' experience, consequently positioning Hibbett well for long-term growth.Possible DeterrentsThough Hibbett’s growth prospects are bright, its trend of reporting lower gross and operating margins, due to increased promotions and markdowns to improve inventory and e-commerce penetration, have been concerns. Notably, fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 was its sixth straight quarter of negative gross and operating margins.Moreover, Hibbett provided a soft outlook for fiscal 2019, due to the week shift resulting from an additional 53rd week in fiscal 2018. This is likely to impact its earnings and sales in the second and third quarters. While second quarter will benefit from increased back-to-school volumes this year, the third quarter will be hurt by the loss of volumes from the season compared with last year.Final ThoughtsHibbett’s robust earnings trend, as well as growth strategies, positions it for more growth ahead. Furthermore, its financial flexibility and ability to generate a strong operating cash flow has helped it to execute long-term strategies such as store expansion, enhancement of products and brand offerings as well as building operational infrastructure.Do Retail Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2198,GPS,"Several industry headwinds, many of which were sparked by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and the rise of e-commerce, forced brick-and-mortar retailers like Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to adapt their businesses in order to survive.These moves have caused some investors to stay away from retailers in recent years. However, like any industry or stock, there are no guarantees in retail. Investors must always focus on the stock’s current fundamentals in order to gauge its possible performance.For example, Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) is expected to see its sales climb by 5.45% to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, which includes the crucial holiday shopping period. But top-line growth for an established company such as Gap is not enough to excite investors on its own.The retailer is also projected to see its quarterly earnings hit $0.59 per share, up more than 15% year over year. Yet, investors will need to see more in order to know if they should expect Gap to actually top this solid EPS estimate.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Gap is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. Coupled with its Earnings ESP of 0.15%, which means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of Gap’s Q4 results, investors should consider the stock as one that could beat earnings estimates.Investors should also note that Gap has topped or matched earnings estimates in the trailing 12 quarters, including beats of 5.45%, 11.54%, and 24.14% over the last three periods, respectivelyGap is set to report its Q4 and fiscal 2017 earnings results after market close on Thursday, March 1.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2199,GPS,"This week we have several very important economic reports and new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s first Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  These top tier reports, will give us key data on future indicators regarding factories, jobs, consumer confidence, and insight to the Fed’s policy direction.The biggest econ report is coming out on Thursday; the ISM Manufacturing Index.  This forward looking report has a long track record of accurately gauging the direction of production, employment, new orders, and inventories.As you can see in the chart, the ISM index has been on an upswing since the end of 2016 and has stayed above the 50 level -which indicates growth in the manufacturing sector- all the way through February of 2018.  The index has remained elevated due the expansion of both the domestic and global economies, strong new orders, and positive employment data. Current expectations are for the index to dip just slightly from its previous reading.  In last month’s report, new orders hit its highest level in almost 10 years.  Another solid report from the ISM would be an overall positive for the industrial, factory, manufacturing, and production segments of the economy. On Wednesday, we will get a preview of the ISM report as the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, or PMI is released.  The Chicago PMI is the most important of the regional manufacturing reports, as it is seen as having a strong correlation to the national ISM manufacturing index.You can see the high correlation between the two manufacturing reports, with the Chicago PMI represented by the bars, and the ISM represented by the purple line.    Last month the Chicago PMI showed extraordinarily strong growth with a reading of 65.7, and Wednesday’s report is expected to come in just barely below that.  This would still be very positive news for the manufacturing sector, as last month’s reading was near its historic high.  If these reports come in as expected, Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Industrial companies like Terex Corp (TEX  -  Free Report), Century Aluminum (CENX  -  Free Report), Roper Tech (ROP  -  Free Report), and Dover Corp (DOV  -  Free Report) will benefit from the positive news.  Also on Wednesday, the GDP report will be released at the opening bell.  This report is considered an all-inclusive measure of domestic economic activity.  This report will also be important to bond traders due to its correlation with inflation measures. A bit after the GDP report is released, new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will make his first major speech where his tone regarding inflationary issues will be very closely monitored. We will also hear reports regarding the Consumer’s view of the economy.  On Tuesday, the Consumer Confidence report comes out, and on Friday, we get the Consumer Sentiment report.  Of the two, the Consumer Confidence data, is the most closely watched.The Consumer Confidence report shows the consumer’s views on the overall economy, and their expectations for the next six months.  This data, is also highly correlated to retail sales as you can see in this chart.Consumer confidence has historically been a key indicator for the future of both the stock and bond markets.  This is due to the fact that consumer spending impacts two thirds of the economy, and a consumer who views the economy in a positive light tends to spend more. The index has stayed near its 17 year high for the past few months.  The February reading is expected to improve slightly from its January levels.  A strong repot would be a positive for several sub sectors in the retail segment which include companies like Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), and Lowe’s Companies (LOW  -  Free Report), all of whom currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.     Overall, this is an important week of reports, and if they come in as expected, it will set a positive tone for the markets for the near term. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2202,GPS,"Retail REIT Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) have reached a settlement over a lawsuit to refrain the latter from proceeding with its plan to close Teavana stores in Simon’s malls, per a report from American City Business Journals.An email from Starbucks, that was cited in the report, read, “We are thankful to our customers who have enjoyed Teavana tea at these specialty retail locations and will continue to emphasize Teavana tea in new and different ways at Starbucks.” The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but the move removes the litigation overhang issue from Simon.In July 2017, Starbucks had made an announcement of store closures involving a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in 2018, with majority expected to close by this spring. While some of the stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before this spring, majority of the leases run through January 2027. Starbucks cited lackluster traffic in malls for the decision to close these stores.However, Simon fought back and alleged that Starbucks’ Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of lease obligations. Further, it claimed that this is just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself.  The mall landlord pointed out that while the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) among others was an outcome of either bankruptcy or financial ruin that was not the case with Starbucks. Rather, going by Simon’s allegations, the Teavana store-closure move came as the business failed to expand at Starbucks’ anticipated pace.Later in 2017, according to the New York Post, Starbucks was temporarily restrained by an Indiana judge from shutting down its 77 Teavana stores in Simon’s malls. Per the order, Starbucks can better absorb the financial loss by keeping its stores open than Simon bearing the brunt of withering vacancies. Although Starbucks planned to make an appeal, this week the company announced reaching a settlement. Notably, retail REITs have continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through the online channel, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Such an environment has led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified. In addition, when there are substantial store closures in the middle of the lease term, not only are mall landlords hurt, but tenants occupying space in that mall are equally affected because their shop visits depend on the mix of specific types of retailers.Shares of Simon Property have underperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past year. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have dropped 11.6%, while the industry has recorded growth of 5.1% during the same time frame.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2204,GPS,"The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) is in investors’ good books owing to its robust stock performance, solid surprise trend, strategic efforts to uplift its responsiveness to changing consumer trends and product quality, enhancement of e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities, and new growth strategy. However, currency headwinds continue to hurt company’s earnings.Shares of Gap gained 45.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 18.3%. Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Strong Surprise HistoryGap displays a solid surprise trend in the recent quarters. The company delivered third-consecutive earnings beat in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, it was the company’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive sales surprise. Additionally, its comparable store sales (comps) reflected strength for the fourth straight quarter, which can be attributed to the continuous growth at its Old Navy Brand fueled by improved traffic. Clearly, the growth initiatives are paying off well.This along with the company’s solid performance in the nine months of fiscal 2017 encouraged management to raise outlook for the fiscal 2017. Gap envisions adjusted earnings for the fiscal year in the range of $2.08-$2.12 per share compared with $2.02-$2.10, projected earlier. Further, comps are anticipated to be up low-single-digits versus previous projection of flat to marginal improvement.Enhancing Online PresenceGap has undertaken several actions in order to cope up with the changing consumer trends. Its robust e-commerce and omni-channel endeavors are driving its online presence across all of its brands. In fact, online is now among its most profitable divisions, posting double-digit sales growth.Recently, Gap announced plans to launch the buy online, pick-up in store service, a new personalization engine that is powered by customer data. Moreover, it has extended the find-in-store, Reserve-in-Store and Order in Store capabilities across various stores. These efforts have also been helping store associates enrich customer experiences, thus highlighting the company’s focus on augmenting omni-channel and digital operations. We expect these initiatives, combined with constant digital investments to boost Gap’s top line in the long run.Focus on Growth Brands Bodes WellGap has narrowed down its focus on its growth brands namely Old Navy and Athleta as a part of its new growth strategy. In fact, the company plans to open 270 Old Navy and Athleta stores and expects net sales of more than $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, at each of these brands over the next few years. These gains will come as a result of U.S. store expansion and mobile and e-commerce growth. Simultaneously, it is on schedule to close 200 underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores over the next three years.Gap expects that these new strategies will create about $500 million in expense savings over the next three years. In addition, it plans to reinvest a portion of those savings toward growth in the near term.Bottom LineThe company’s growth strategies and omni-channel capabilities clearly reveal its long-term potential. However, currency headwinds have been taking a toll on Gap’s performance by hurting its top and bottom lines. Also, the company’s Banana Republic brand continues to be a spoilsport.Do Retail-Apparel Stocks Grab Your Attention? Check TheseInvestors interested may consider American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report), Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) and Zumiez Inc. , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2205,GPS,"2017 has undoubtedly been a tough year for the retailers, who struggled to maintain good business due to changing preferences and habits of consumers. The year saw an outbreak of online shopping fervor, which almost put the existence of traditional and department store retailers in question. Increased promotions, price wars, lower store and mall traffic, brick-and-mortar store closures, strengthening of online and omni-channel portals were some of the common trends witnessed through the year.Additionally, the retail sector saw some renowned retailers file bankruptcy, including small mom-and-pop stores as well as major retailers. Some names on the list were Toys R Us, Payless Shoes, Gymboree and Rue21. A major reason behind the demise of these stores was the absence of online presence as consumers today prefer to use smartphones and tablets to shop, instead of spending time in a brick-and-mortar outlet.Hence, the winners in today’s market are those taking strides to boost online presence through investments in enhancement of digital and mobile offerings, alongside improving product acceptance. Further, retailers are adopting various initiatives to improve omni-channel capabilities. Through these initiatives retailers are not only enhancing online business but also reviving the importance of physical stores. Some omni-channel capabilities that were successful in 2017 include “Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store”, “Ship from Store”, “Find-in-Store”, “Reserve-in-Store”, “Order in Store”, “Reserve Online and Try In-Store”, “Buy Online, Return In Store”, “Click and Collect” and same-day delivery services.Further, retailers have been taking steps to enhance the capacities of distribution centers to improve deliveries of goods purchased online. Retailers gaining from the roll out if these capabilities and improved distribution centers include The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Decker’s Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report), among others.Retailers’ omni-channel strategies were more prominent this holiday season, when retailers came up with interesting offers to lure customers. Apart from early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, free shipping on online purchases, price match guarantee and enticing gift ideas were some offers shoppers could not resist this holiday season. This, along with a strengthening economy and a stable labor market, led to a successful holiday season for retailers in long time.Looking ahead, we anticipate the optimism from the holiday fest to continue in 2018, as retailers’ omni-channel efforts will continue to lure shoppers. That said, we are here to analyze some of the retailers and their enticing strategies, which have the ability to hook up customers through the New Year.Retailers Poised to Steer the Sector’s Growth in 2018On top of the list is e-retailing giant, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). The popularity that the company has garnered in recent years is unprecedented. The company’s technological expertise is the mantra for its ability to provide a seamless shopping experience. Its user-friendly app and website, impressive product assortment, constant innovations, along with seamless payment and checkout system have helped it to become consumers’ favorite shopping destination.Amazon’s retail business is nearly unbeatable on grounds of price, choice, and convenience with the help of a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy. The company continues to push advantages exclusively to Prime members, consequently encouraging them to spend more on Amazon. Further, the company’s strategy of gradually merging online and offline retail looks promising. The company’s online and offline feature, added to its bookstores has gained significant popularity in recent times. Moreover, the company is taking this forward with innovations such as drive-in-grocery delivery service (AmazonFresh Pickup - order groceries online and collect them from a store nearby) and “cashier-less” stores (Amazon Go – the company’s first brick-and mortar grocery store).These strategies are likely to fend off competition arising from traditional retailers building their e-commerce businesses as well as other e-retailing counterparts. Further, the company is continually expanding offerings through acquisitions and pacts with leading brands. The company’s recent takeover of grocery retailer, Whole Foods Market Inc.; and agreement with Nike Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) to directly sell products on Amazon.com, are examples of its expansion strategy.Driven by these efforts, the company recorded 25% growth in net sales, which came in at roughly $38 billion in the second quarter of 2017. When most retailers are struggling to boost their top lines, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth is a clear indication of how well it poised to capture the lion’s share.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Next comes the supermarket chain, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), which is putting in due efforts to neutralize the dominance of Amazon in the retail space. The company’s latest strategy of keeping online prices almost at par with Amazon during the holiday season has left an indelible impression on the minds of industry gurus. Sources revealed that Walmart’s prices were just 0.3% higher than Amazon’s, clearly reflecting the company’s efforts to gain a good share this holiday season.While this was a strategy to counter competition, particularly this holiday season, Wal-Mart has been continually taking steps to boost e-commerce sales through acquisitions, alliances and enhanced delivery and payment systems. Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com, along with its Walmart Pay mobile payment system and Mobile Express Returns program underscore its quest to accelerate online business.Further, Walmart’s efforts to enhance delivery services resonate well with its strategy of growing online grocery sales. For this, the company’s recent acquisition of a delivery startup Parcel, Inc., and previous agreements with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for speedy online grocery deliveries, have been notable. Additionally, the Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. Further, the company continues to test same-day and next-day delivery to enhance services further.Consequently, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales soared 50% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily owing to Walmart.com’s performance, including significant contributions from Walmart’s online grocery service. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last, but not the least, we have Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), a department store chain that is leaving no stone unturned to stay in business in the current competitive retail landscape. The company has been deploying resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. In a recent move, the company announced price-cuts for various products, following Amazon’s decision to slash prices at the recent acquired Whole Foods business.Further, the company has been emphasizing on growth of e-commerce business, through the launch of an international version of its website, expanding merchandise assortments through introduction of new brands, aggressive cost reduction strategy, rationalization of supply chain with same-day delivery of in-store purchases, as well as technology and process improvements. Further, it waged war against other retail big-wigs by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items and launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores.Additionally, to leave a mark in the booming online grocery delivery market, the company has teamed with online grocery delivery service Instacart and made significant headway in the same-day delivery race by acquiring grocery delivery company Shipt. Further, the company’s Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Moreover, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, Target acquired Grand Junction. We believe these efforts will help the company provide some solid competition to big-wigs in the retail space. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2206,GPS,"After the news of an uptick in the U.S. consumer confidence to a 17-year high and the latest tax reform that is likely to lower the burden, retailers got another reason to smile as retail sales increased for the third straight month. The better-than-expected November retail sales added extra jingle to the holiday season that is approaching its crescendo with Christmas just a week away.A solid start to the shopping season highlights the underlying economic strength that paved the way for a rate hike for the third time this year. Analysts believe that a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, improved employment picture and modest inflation are enough to trigger consumer spending. All these sound favorable for retailers, who try to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits.Sturdy Retail SalesThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in November advanced 0.8% to $492.7 billion — following a revised reading of 0.5% increase registered in October. Retail sales improved 5.8% from November 2016. The report suggests that sales at electronics & appliance stores rose 2.1%, while receipts at gasoline stations and sales at building material dealers jumped 2.8% and 1.2%, respectively.Sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers dipped 0.2%, while at clothing shops the same rose 0.7%. Meanwhile, sales at food & beverage stores and receipts at restaurants witnessed growth of 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 2.5% and increased 10.4% from the prior-year period.Holiday Season: Likely Bonanza for RetailersHealthy November retail sales only raises hope for a blissful holiday season.

2207,GPS,"The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) has picked up momentum in the past one month from robust top and bottom-line performance in third-quarter fiscal 2017 and a solid comparable store sales (comps) trend. Additionally, constant focus on product quality enhancement, new growth strategy and responsiveness toward changing consumer behavior has rewarded the company well.Notably, Gap’s shares have gained 15% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s growth 12.9%. Moreover, the stock has witnessed a substantial 57.8% increase year to date.Let us analyze the factors influencing the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s performance.Robust Surprise TrendThe success of the company’s endeavors is clearly visible from its surprise history and upbeat outlook for fiscal 2017. Gap witnessed the third successive earnings beat in the last reported quarter and the fourth consecutive positive sales surprise. Also, improved traffic led to the fourth straight quarter of comps growth for the Old Navy brand. The company’s namesake brand also reflected comps strength. Clearly, Gap’s growth initiatives are paying off, which along with a solid performance in the nine months of fiscal 2017 encouraged management to raise the outlook for the full fiscal.Gap, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  Gap, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteNew Growth Strategy – Focus on Growth BrandsOver the past two years, Gap has significantly improved its customer satisfaction by delivering quality products faster and more consistently. Now, it has shifted its focus on growth brands, Old Navy and Athleta, as part of its new expansion strategy. The company expects net sales to exceed $10 billion for Old Navy and more than $1 billion for Athleta in the next few years.Investments in Online and Digital Platforms Bode WellGap has been gaining from consistent focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Constant efforts to bolster digital and mobile offerings, alongside improving product acceptance, are worth mentioning in this regard. Gap is strengthening its e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities to streamline the North American business. Recently, it announced a buy online, pick-up in store service and many more investments in omni-channel services, which have helped enriched customer experience. Notably, the company has increased its online presence across all of its brands, and its online division is one of its most profitable, posting double-digit sales growth.Hurdles to CrossWhile all is well with Gap’s fundamentals, currency headwinds may dampen its operating performance due to significant international presence. Though earnings and sales topped estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017, currency headwinds caused earnings per share to decline year over year. Evidently, adverse currency movements dented third-quarter bottom-line growth by nearly 3 percentage points.Do Retail-Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2208,GPS,"Shareholders of Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) have reasons to cheer. The company recently clinched a victory over Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) in a lawsuit to refrain the latter from proceeding with its plan to close Teavana stores in Simon’s malls.Specifically, according to the New York Post, Starbucks has been temporarily barred by an Indiana judge from shutting down its 77 Teavana stores in Simon’s malls. Per the order, the company can better absorb the financial loss by keeping the stores open than Simon bearing the brunt of withering vacancies.Notably, in July, Starbucks had made an announcement of store closures involving a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in the next year, with majority expected to close by spring. Though some of the Teavana stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before the spring of 2018, majority of the leases run through January 2027. Starbucks cited disappointing traffic in malls for its decision to close the stores.Simon fought back and alleged that Starbucks’ Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of lease obligations. However, there were no specifications in the lawsuit about the amount of financial relief or damage sought by Simon, per the Indianapolis Business Journal news.Simon further alleged that this was just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself. In fact, the mall landlord pointed out that the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), among others, was an outcome of either bankruptcy or financial ruin.However, this is not the case with Starbucks, which has earned reputation for being “one of the largest and most recognized companies in the world.” Rather, the Teavana store-closure move came as the business failed to expand at Starbucks’ anticipated pace, going by Simon’s allegations.As a matter of fact, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences shifting to online retail. This has made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures over the last several quarters.Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This comes as a pressing concern for retail REITs, as this trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Moreover, the choppy retail real estate market situation is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which is considered unjustified by landlords. Also, significant store closures in the middle of the lease term not only harm mall landlords, but also the tenants occupying space in the mall because their shop visits also depend on the mix of specific type of retailers.Shares of Simon Property have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in the year so far. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have dropped 8.4%, while the industry recorded growth of 11.4% during this time frame.

2209,GPS,"North Korea testing its deadliest ballistic missile sent shockwaves through Wall Street, while drawing widespread rebuke from across the globe. As the U.S. Congress returns from its summer recess on Sep 5, the chances of a possible showdown with Silicon Valley and government shutdown are high.Investors are already dealing with the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey on the stock market. Add to this an overwhelming majority of fund managers seeing U.S. market as the most overvalued, and then a market correction seems inevitable in the near term. Also, September has typically recorded dismal stock returns over the past two decades.With the month expected to be rough, investing in sound dividend paying stocks seems judicious. Such stocks provide higher total returns with lower volatility, which are undoubtedly the ‘holy grail’ of investing.Markets Cautious After North Korea Nuclear TestThe situation with North Korea continues to be tense and uncertain. The nation conducted its largest nuclear test on Sep 4, when the U.S. markets observed Labor Day holiday. Pyongyang is also preparing to launch another intercontinental ballistic missile.The United States warned that countries trading with North Korea were adding fuel to its “dangerous nuclear intentions”. At the United Nations Security Council meeting, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said that North Korea’s Kim Jong Un was “begging for war.” He requested all the council members to levy tough new sanctions on the rogue nation. South Korea, in the meanwhile, is in talks with Washington to deploy aircraft carriers and strategic bombers to the Korean peninsula. South Korea conducted long-range air-to-surface and ballistic missiles following North Korea’s nuclear test.Mmain U.S. stock index futures took a beating on Sep 4, with the Dow briefly trading as low as 103 points, as per Fact Set data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures also slipped to close in the negative territory.Tension in Silicon Valley, Possibilities of Government Shutdown LoomOn the domestic front, President Trump intends to end Obama’s deferred action for childhood arrivals program. Almost 800,000 so-called Dreamers are staying in the United States on a renewable work permit. Silicon Valley, which has fiercely defended immigration programs, is now expected to face a heavy blow. CEOs of major tech players are urging Trump to reconsider his opinion. Trump’s recent policies have already put him at logger heads with the tech community. Needless to say, last month, tensions sparked between Washington and Silicon Valley following the President’s remarks on the violence in Charlottesville, VA.Anxiety has already gripped the Wall Street over the debate to raise the federal government’s debt ceiling, which has frayed relations between President Trump and the Republican leadership. With the disconnect growing, the chances that the government will shut down is 50/50, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report). In fact, such a shutdown will result in the holdup of all non-emergency government funding such as worker furloughs, closing of public offices, shutdown of national parks and interruptions in implementation of pro-business policies.Harvey & Its ImpactHurricane Harvey, in the meanwhile, lashed the Texas coast in recent days. The storm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4. It worsened due to a lethal confluence of meteorological events. While it is too early to gauge the financial impact of the hurricane, some experts are calling for losses in the double-digit billions.Investors saw insurance stocks take a hit as its ill effects mounted adding to a dour tone to match the human miseries. Investors were told that one-third of all U.S. refineries are located in the Houston area, which was also severely affected. Are U.S. Stocks Overvalued?As if all of that wasn’t enough, a record number of fund managers see the U.S. market as the most overvalued in the world. Among the 20 valuation metrics tracked by Ned Davis Research, 16 of them indicate U.S. stocks are extremely overvalued.Stocks’ current cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio has only been exceeded in 1929 and 2000 – both prior to major corrections. In 1929, Wall Street was subjected to an infamous crash, while 2000 saw the dotcom implosion. This time around, expansion in profit margins led to loft valuations, which raises concerns of a possible downturn.Talking about pullbacks, Stock Trader’s Almanac found out that in September, since 1950, the S&P 500 and the Dow averaged a loss of 0.5% and 0.8%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite, as incepted in 1971, averaged a loss of 0.5%, as did the Russell 2000 of small-cap stocks since it was started in 1979.5 Dividend Stocks to Counter the Worst MonthWith so many concerns plaguing investors’ minds, dividend paying stocks are tempting options at the moment. The best dividend stocks pay out a healthy yield and have strong prospects, and are less susceptible to market downturns.

Customers opting for same-day delivery services will have to shell out $8 to avail the service.Macy’s previously had same-day delivery services in 18 markets and will now cover 33 markets.

The company’s “Buy Online Pickup in Store” initiative is also gaining traction.The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change. With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including big-box, are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels and are being forced to trim store count to focus more on an online model.Restructuring InitiativesThis department store retailer recently announced the restructuring of merchandising operations that includes combining of merchandising, planning and private brands divisions into one segment. Management cautioned that the restructuring is likely to result in the loss of 100 jobs.As part of the restructuring, the company would incur one-time costs of approximately $20-$25 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.

2211,GPS,"Owing to the rising demand of smartwatches, Fossil Group Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) is now geared up to enrich its wearables portfolio by adding new brands to its smartwatch line-up in 2018. These new brands will be powered by Google’s Android Wear and will be compatible with both iOS and Android phones. Customers can personalize watch faces, create shortcuts to play music or monitor activity goals. These brands will add to the current portfolio of five brands — Diesel, Emporio Armani, Fossil, Michael Kors and Misfit — that will offer customers touchscreen smartwatches in fall 2017. Not only this, the company is also planning to roll out new hybrid smartwatches from Armani Exchange, Chaps, Emporio Armani, Diesel, DKNY, Fossil, kate spade new york, Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, MICHELE, Misfit, Relic, Skagen and Tory Burch in stores during the fall and holiday season.Notably, this global consumer fashion accessories maker has launched its 2017 touchscreen smartwatch line-up earlier this year, having compatibility with both iOS and Android phones. Their designs featured full-round AMOLED displays and were thinner, sleeker, comfortable to wear and found great appeal among female customers. Fossil Group seeks to launch more than 300 connected watch styles across 14 brands by the end of 2017.Expansion in Wearable SpaceFossil Group has been expanding its wearables supported by Google’s Android Wear since it first launched its Android Wear smartwatch in November 2015. In the last 12 months, Fossil Group doubled its distribution points for its connected devices and more than doubled its sales of wearables.The introduction of wearable technology in watches has offered ample opportunity to the company to extend its reach of brands and offer customers new functionality with accessories, including activity trackers, hybrid watches and smart watches. Fossil Group’s expansion in the wearable space is benefiting the company, as the company is getting the advantage of Android’s popularity and Google’s technology in its watches. The acquisition of Misfit in November 2015 has provided an opportunity to integrate Misfit's software and hardware platforms in the next generation of connected accessories, thereby advancing Fossil Group's connected accessories initiative further.The company has also connected celebrities with the wearable brands to reintroduce customers to the Fossil brand. The company expects to increase its marketing spending by over 40% in fiscal 2017 on wearables to generate awareness for the new functionality available in these fashion-first technology accessories.Soft Sales in Traditional Watches Pose HeadwindsWe note that this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has been witnessing soft sales in traditional watches for a long time now due to increased competition. Rising demand for technology in watches have also dented the demand for traditional watches. Also, volatility in sales pattern is expected as consumer preferences evolve around the globe. Also, the success of the Michael Kors brand is overshadowing other brands’ performance. Moreover, in January 2016, Burberry announced that it is exiting the watch business and does not intend to renew its license agreement upon its expiration at the end of 2017, has also hurt the company’s business. The company continues to expect weakness in this category in the near term. Further, sales of leathers and jewelry have persistently been weak over the last few quarters. Decline in traditional watches and weak leather business also hurt sales in the Americas, Europe and Asia regions during the first half of 2017.Fossil Group, Inc. Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth)  Fossil Group, Inc. Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) | Fossil Group, Inc. QuoteSoft Second-Quarter Fiscal 2017 ResultsFossil Group reported narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 on Aug 9, while sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. We note that the company has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine out of the last 11 straight quarters, including the current one. The watchmaker also provided a bleaker outlook and slashed its earnings, sales and operating income guidance. Adjusted loss of 23 cents per share was unfavorable from the last year’s earnings of 9 cents per share, largely due to a decline in the top line, lower gross margin and currency headwinds. Though connected watches helped in growing the company’s sales, overall net sales decreased 13% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a decline in the company's multi-brand licensed watch portfolio and challenging environment for the traditional watch category. Declines in leather and jewelry business as well as unfavorable currency also led to the decline.Share Price PerformanceIf we analyze the last six months’ performance of the company, we note that Fossil Group’s shares have declined 54.5% as compared with the industry, which has declined around 26.4% in the said time frame. On the other hand, the broader Retail and Wholesale sector has gained 9.5% in the last six months.Bottom LineThough the company’s watches category remains sluggish, we are impressed that the company’s connected watches have helped in growing the company’s sales. In fact, the company remains confident that wearables have the ability to help mitigate the ongoing softness in the traditional watch category. The company also focuses on the New World Fossil restructuring program along with growth in the company’s core watch business and product expansion. Fossil Group is also looking to exit underperforming stores to generate savings and drive growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the apparel industry include The Children’s Place, Inc.

2212,GPS,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) recently sued Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) to refrain the latter from going in for its plan to close the Teavana stores in Simon’s malls. The move comes amid a wave of store closure announcements in recent times which have served a severe blow to the retail real estate market.The AllegationsSimon’s lawsuit alleged that Starbucks’ 78 Teavana store closures in its malls would result in a breach of its lease obligations. Further, the company claimed that this store closure announcement by Starbucks has led to an adverse impact on the value of Simon’s properties. However, there were no specifications in the lawsuit about the amount of financial relief or damage sought by Simon, per the Indianapolis Business Journal news.Notably, the Starbucks’ July announcement of store closures involves a shutter down of all 379 of its Teavana stores in the next year, with majority occurring by spring 2018. However, only two of the Teavana stores in Simon malls have leases slated for expiry before the spring of 2018, but the leases for the rest 76 stores run through January 2027.Starbucks cited lackluster traffic in malls for the decision to close the stores. However, Simon alleged that this is just a lame excuse by Starbucks to refract the blame from itself. In fact, the mall landlord pointed out that the decision of store closures from several retailers like Sports Authority, Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), Macy’s Inc.

These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times.Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This comes as a pressing concern for retail REITs, as this trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.In fact, year to date, the REIT Retail industry has underperformed the broader market. This industry has declined 6.5% over this time frame, as against a 9.9% gain of the S&P 500.Amid these, mall landlords have already decided to go to the mattresses. These companies are continuing to make concerted efforts to turn their boring retail hubs into swanky entertainment zones, digitizing their malls and turning into distribution hubs.However, the choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which the mall landlords are finding it unjustified. Moreover, significant store closures in the middle of the lease term not only hurt the mall landlord, but also the tenants occupying space in that mall because their shop visits also depend on the mix of specific type of retailers.Currently, Simon Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2213,GPS,"Retail sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. Stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.The first and foremost reason for the same is the latest tax reform that is likely to come into shape, following the approval of the Senate. The tax code once implemented is likely to lower the burden of retailers, who now topped the list with a corporate tax rate of as much as 35%. President Trump has been recommending a tax rate of as much as 20% and pushing hard to pass on the benefits to companies who generate all or most part of revenues in the United States.The news was enough to drive the retail stocks. As a result, shares of Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) gained 6.7%, 6.6%, 5.1%, 4.4% and 3.7%, respectively, yesterday.Certainly, the “Trump Factor” is ruling the U.S. stock market but it is also the attractive holiday season deals that are exciting consumers. The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday to Cyber Monday, marked an auspicious start to the holiday-shopping season. Retailers are cashing in on customers preferring to shop from the comfort of their homes, mostly online or through their mobile phones.A Stellar Start to the SeasonOnline sales on Thanksgiving Day surged 18.3% to $2.87 billion, per Adobe Analytics. Bargain hunters bought $5.03 billion worth of products online on Black Friday, an increase of 16.9% from last year. The euphoria did not end here, as the shopping frenzy was palpable on Cyber Monday when online sales soared 16.8% to $6.59 billion.A blockbuster Thanksgiving weekend and buoyant Cyber Monday indicate that the season is turning out to be a bonanza for retailers. Per National Retail Federation (“NRF”), approximately 174 million customers shopped in stores and online during this weekend. The trade group estimates that an American spent about an average of $335.47 during the five-day period.Further, shopping through mobile devices was the most prominent trend that developed during this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period, as nearly 63% of customers used their smart phones to make buying decisions, while 29% used it to actually buy goods.This indeed points to a blissful shopping season for retailers. With Christmas falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day compared with last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.Wrapping UpImproving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in retailers about a robust holiday season. From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year.

2214,GPS,"Markets enjoyed another month of strong gains, boosted by encouraging economic data and hopes surrounding tax reforms. Additionally, the Fed chose not to hike rates in November and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy. Significant progress was made on President Trump’s much-vaunted tax legislation. Ultimately, the House of Representatives finally passed the much awaited tax cuts legislation now named as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.November’s PerformanceFor the month of November, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq surged 3.87%, 2.8% and 2.2%, respectively. The blue-chip index posted its eighth consecutive month of gains — the highest streak of gains in the last 22 years. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 also posted eight straight months in gains. The last time around when the S&P 500 had achieved such a feat was way back in 2007. The indexes have gained in the range of 18% to 28% so far in 2017.The Fed chose not to hike rates in November and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy and said that it has been improving at a ""solid rate."" On Nov 16, the House finally passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Finally, The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes indicated that a rate hike was almost certain in December, but stated that only one or two rate hikes are likely in 2018.Encouraging Domestic DataEconomic data released during November was largely encouraging. ISM Services Index increased from 59.8% to 60.1% in October, reaching its best settlement since August 2005. Construction spending increased 0.3% to $1.22 trillion in September, up from 0.1% in August. Retail sales for October increased a meager 0.2%, but exceeded the consensus estimate.Industrial production for October surged 0.9%, surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.6%. PPI for October came in at 0.4%, in line with the previous month’s figure. Core CPI for October came in at 0.2%, up from 0.1% in September. Factory Orders increased by 1.4%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 1.3%. Consumer spending surged 0.3% in October, in line with the consensus estimate for the period.However, PCE Inflation for October came in at 0.1%, below the previous month’s figure of 0.4%. Additionally, the ISM Manufacturing Index came in at 58.7 in October, down from 59.8 in September.

The consensus estimate for the period was 1.2 million units. Moreover, the index of home builder sentiment touched an eight-month high in November. (Read: Housing Starts Rebound Post Hurricanes: 4 Top Picks)Additionally, sales of new single-family houses in the United States increased 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October. This marks the biggest percentage gain since January 1992. (Read: Housing ETFs to Buy in 2018)Further, existing homes sales rose 2% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.48 million. Meanwhile, pending home sales for the month of October increased 3.5%, surpassing the consensus estimate of 2% growth.Q3 GDP Exhibits Highest Rate of Growth Since 2014According to the second estimate from the Department of Commerce, the gross domestic product of the United States expanded at an astounding 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017. This also marks it fastest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2014.Meanwhile, consumer spending, the biggest contributor to economic growth advanced 2.3% in the 3Q17. Further, spending on business equipment shot up 10.4% in the period, also notching up a three-year high. Meanwhile, corporate pre-tax profits have surged 5.4% year over year.Unemployment Hits 17-Yr Low, Job Additions RiseThe United States created 261,000 jobs in October, which came as a breather after only 18,000 job additions in September. Employment in key sectors like food services and drinking places, and professional and business services contributed to last month’s job creations. Employment in food services and drinking places created 89,000 jobs in October, after losing 98,000 jobs in September. Also, professional and business services added 50,000 jobs. However, October’s job additions were below the consensus estimate of 297,000 job additions.Additionally, average hourly wages remained mostly flat in October, which came lower than the consensus estimate of a gain of 0.2%. Meanwhile, in October the unemployment rate came down from 4.2% to 4.1%, lower than the consensus expectation of 4.2%. This is the lowest pace recorded since December 2000.Two Versions of New Tax Bill EmergeOn Nov 2, Republicans of the House finally unveiled a detailed tax cut policy under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which seeks to reduce corporate and revoke the taxes paid by large businesses. The tax bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20%, making it the permanent rate.On Nov 9, another version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. For instance, unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Such a confused state of affairs dampened investor sentiment. Moreover, market watchers speculated that no formal decision was likely on the tax Bill before Thanksgiving. Such fears weighed heavily on the broader markets.House of Representatives Passes CutsOn Nov 16, House of Representatives finally passed the much-awaited tax cuts legislation. This takes President Trump and his team one step closer toward realizing their most important agenda — tax reforms.Ultimately, in a 12-11 vote on Nov 28, the Senate Budget Committee advanced the Tax Bill proposed by the members of the GOP. Senators Bob Corker and Ron Johnson also voted in favor of the Bill. Senator John McCain also stated that he would vote in favor of the Bill.Black Friday Sales Push Retailers HigherHoliday shopping continued even after Black Friday, eventually boosting gains for retailers. Per the report from Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), Black Friday sales of online retailers totaled a whopping $5.03 billion. Online retail giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) edged up 0.8%  on Nov 27 and posted its fourth consecutive record finish in as many trading sessions. Meanwhile, retailers like American Eagle Outfitters (AEO  -  Free Report), Dillard’s Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) and Gap Inc.(GPS  -  Free Report) all increased 1.8%, 4.7% and 1.21%, respectively. On the other hand, fast food retailer Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG  -  Free Report) lost 1.8% and toy makers like Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) and Mattel MAT declined 1% and 1.5%, respectively. Fed Refrains from Rate Hike, Powell to Be Next Fed ChairMarkets gained traction on Wednesday after the Fed decided not to raise the benchmark interest rates and offered a positive view about the U.S. economy. At the end of its two day meet, the Fed stated that the U.S. economy has been growing at a ""solid rate"" compared to a ""moderate rate"" in September.Although, the Fed kept the interest rate unchanged in the range of 1% to 1.25%, it indicated that there is a huge possibility of a hike in rate in December.  Meanwhile, a minority of policymakers maintained that the rate hike should be kept on hold till the inflation target of 2% is met.Meanwhile, President Trump appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Jerome Powell as Janet Yellen’s successor post the expiration of her term as Fed Chief in February.In the minutes of Oct 31-Nov 1 FOMC policy meeting, Fed officials clearly hinted at a December rate hike. However, some policymakers showed concerns over “persistent” slowdown in inflation and indicated that the central bank may scale back to one or at two rate increases next year, which was lower than the previously expected three rate hikes.5 Star Performers for NovemberI ran a screen on Research Wizard for companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):1.

2216,GPS,"After the news of an unexpected uptick in the U.S. retail sales — +0.2% — in October, retailers got another reason to smile as they head into the holiday season. Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — reached its highest level in almost 17 years. Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November from October’s revised reading of 126.2.Analysts believe that buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to a 17-year low, and a lift in the economic activity post hurricanes were enough to boost consumer sentiment. The positive sentiment is likely to trigger consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. Any increase in this metric at this juncture signals consumers’ willingness to spend more this season.This Means a Lot for RetailersImproving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in retailers about a robust holiday season. The festive season is often a make-or-break time for retailers, as it accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers will go the extra mile.The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday to Cyber Monday, marked an auspicious start to the holiday-shopping season. Per National Retail Federation (“NRF”) approximately 174 million customers shopped in stores and online during this weekend. The trade group estimates that an American spent about an average of $335.47 during the five-day period.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers. With Christmas falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day compared with last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.Overall, NRF projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Wrapping UpFrom Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) to Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) to Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year. With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging, online retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra.Wal-Mart is making huge investments in e-commerce initiatives. The company’s acquisitions of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com are in sync with its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Further, the company partnered with Alphabet’s Google to enable shopping through Google Express using voice-activated service. The company is also trying to keep the prices of items more competitive.Target has been also focusing on developing online business. In a bid to stimulate digital sales this holiday season, the company is strengthening relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Recently, it waged war against other retail big-wigs by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items and launched curbside pickup program at 50 Twin Cities stores.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail sector but what about investing in the space right now?

Furthermore, the company now anticipates sales growth of nearly 6.3%, alongside a 6.5% increase in comps.Near-Term CatalystsHome Depot has been implementing several initiatives to drive growth. Evidently, the company has redesigned its website with enhanced features for better search and faster checkout, besides upgrading its mobile app. Moreover, its interconnected strategy goes beyond the dot.com investments as it continues to invest in fulfillment options to cater to customers’ demand through the launch of customer order management system (COM) and the Buy Online Deliver From Store (BODFS) capabilities.Meanwhile, the world’s largest home improvement specialty retailer has been gaining from its focus on Professional Customers or Pro Customers. Also, it has undertaken several strides in this regard, which has helped Home Depot to reap significant benefits.

2218,GPS,"The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) looks good backed by its new growth strategy, solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Also, the company has been making constant efforts to boost digital and mobile offerings, besides improving product acceptance. Though currency headwinds and its Banana Republic brand continue to play spoilsport, we believe these to be offset by initiatives undertaken.In fact, Gap’s endeavors are well reflected in its share price movement. So far this year, the stock is up 30%, as against the industry’s decline of 13.8%. The company’s shares have also outpaced the broader Retail-Wholesale sector’s gain of 26.3%. Additionally, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock exhibits a VGM Score of B with a long-term earnings growth rate of 8%, highlighting its inherent potential.Let’s Dive DeepGrowth DriversGap’s new growth strategy looks quite appeasing. The company is now shifting focus to its two growth brands — Old Navy and Athleta. Over the next few years, it expects net sales of more than $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, at each of the brands owing to U.S. store expansion and mobile and e-commerce growth.Additionally, management plans to open 270 Old Navy and Athleta stores while closing 200 underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, simultaneously, over the next three years.As consumers have been gradually shifting to online shopping, Gap is enhancing its e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities by adopting a number of initiatives. To this end, the company has increased its online presence across all of its brands. In fact, its online division is posting double-digit sales growth. Gap also announced plans to launch the buy online, pick-up in store service, a new personalization engine that is powered by customer data, and continued significant investment in its omni-channel services. We believe these initiatives should boost Gap’s top line and overall performance.Robust Surprise History & Upbeat OutlookGap delivered its third consecutive positive earnings surprise with fourth straight sales beat in third-quarter fiscal 2017. In addition, comparable store sales (comps) reflected strength for the fourth consecutive quarter amid a tough retail scenario. Though comps growth was backed by continued gains at Old Navy brand and growth at its namesake brand, it was partly offset by comps decline at Banana Republic.Driven by its initiatives and a solid performance in the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, management raised full-year outlook. Gap now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $2.08-$2.12 per share compared with $2.02-$2.10, projected earlier. Further, comps are anticipated to be up low-single-digits versus previous projection of flat to marginal improvement.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has moved up by 4 cents to $2.10 in the last seven days.Concerns/WeaknessesGap’s significant international presence exposes the company to adverse currency fluctuations. Though its earnings and sales topped estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017, currency headwinds caused earnings to decline year over year. Evidently, the bottom line fell 3.3% in the quarter compared with the year-ago period. In the fiscal second quarter, earnings and revenues were down on a year-over-year basis.Also, the company has been witnessing persistent softness across Banana Republic for a while now. Evidently, its comps declined 4%, 5% and 1% in the first, second and third quarters, respectively.Gap Vs IndustryLooking for Solid Picks, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the same industry include Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report), The Buckle, Inc.

It was even hard to find good quality value stocks.But over the summer, several industries broke down which has brought some stocks that were overpriced previously, back into the value fold.Tracey has talked about all three industries recently: the restaurants, the exploration and production energy companies, and now she takes a look at the retailers.Will All Shopping Be Done on Amazon?Could there be a more hated industry than the retailers right now?Many investors believe that the traditional retailers are doomed. The most extreme scenario is that they ALL go out of business and Amazon ends up ruling the retail world in the United States.But realistically, most of us know that’s not going to be the case. Humans are social. We like shopping. There’s a reason the Grand Bazaar has been operating in Istanbul for hundreds of years. However, there’s no doubt that online shopping has been disruptive in the industry. There are clearly winners and losers.With the stocks selling off this summer, value investors should be looking at the industry for buying opportunities.Screening for Retail ValueTracey did screen for retail stocks with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) in the retail sector with P/Es under 10. She wanted them dirt cheap.17 companies made it through the screen. She expanded it to companies with P/Es under 15, still cheap compared to the S&P 500.55 companies made the cut including the auto retailers, pharmacies, furniture retailers and department stores.She narrowed it down to those most investors have heard of and are familiar with.Are These Dirt Cheap Retail Stocks a Buy?1.      Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY  -  Free Report) has a forward P/E of 6.9. Should value investors be intrigued?2.     Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) is trading with a forward P/E of just 6.3. It also pays a dividend, currently yielding 7.1%. There’s no guarantee on the dividend’s “safety” of course, but with fundamentals like that, is it time to add it to the short list?3.     JC Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) fell to 42-year lows after its earnings report. It’s profitable again and its P/E is now 8.9. Is this a risk worth taking?4.     Pier 1 (PIR  -  Free Report) has seen its shares plunge about 50% in 2017. Shares now have a forward P/E of 8.7. It has been in a turnaround for a number of years, is it finding success?5.     Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) has a forward P/E of just 11.3 and pays a dividend yielding 3.9%. But its shares are actually UP on the year, having risen 5%. Is Banana Republic finally finding its feet after a few rocky years?Tracey also looked at the insider buying at these, and several other, cheap retailers.Are the Insiders Sending a Signal by Buying?She uses insider buying as a signal in the beaten down industries that there may be value there.After all, the insiders are putting their own money in too. They wouldn’t be buying if they didn’t have some belief in the company.The insiders are buying in some of the retailers now.

2224,GPS,"The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change. With digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including big-box, are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels and are being forced to trim store count to focus more on an online model. Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) is not fully immune to these retail headwinds and therefore leaving no stone unturned to be back on growth trajectory.This department store retailer announced the restructuring of its merchandising operations that includes combining of merchandising, planning and private brands divisions into one segment. Management cautioned that the restructuring is likely to result in the loss of 100 jobs.As part of the restructuring, the company would incur one-time costs of approximately $20-$25 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. However, management expects to save about $30 million on an annual basis. The company anticipates saving about $5 million or approximately 1 cent a share in the final quarter.In another move, Hal Lawton has been appointed as president of Macy’s, effective Sep 8, 2017. Lawton who previously served as the senior vice president in eBay North America, will directly report to the company’s CEO Jeff Gennette. At Macy’s, Lawton will be handling merchandising, stores, operations, technology, along with consumer insights and analytics.Will Aforementioned Moves Pull Stock Out of Doldrums?Analysts view this restructuring activity as a goal to streamline operations, make decision making process much simpler and manage inventory and pricing more efficiently.

Macy’s now envisions fiscal 2017 gross margin to contract 50-70 basis points.Nevertheless, Macy’s has announced a slew of measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omnichannel capabilities to enhance sales, profitability and cash flows.

Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Robust Surprise Trend & Solid Holiday Show: Lifts ViewAbercrombie’s robust surprise trend reflects an earnings beat in the last two quarters with sales beating estimates thrice in a row. This sturdy trend can be attributed to the company’s several strategic initiatives to spur its business forward.Additionally, the company witnessed splendid performance across all its channels and brands during this holiday season. In fact, the results were driven by continued strength in Hollister brand and marked improvement in its namesake brand. Consequently, the company anticipates its namesake brand to deliver positive comps for the fourth quarter.Following the spectacular results in the holiday season, the company raised its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 guidance as well.

Sales growth is anticipated in the low-teens range against the previously forecasted mid- to high-single digits range.Hollister Brand Expansion Aids GrowthAbercrombie is expanding its Hollister stores across new markets aggressively to counter the dismal performance at its namesake brand. Comparable store sales (comps) for the Hollister brand were up 8% in third-quarter fiscal 2017 as it continued to capitalize on momentum, delivering positive comps in both the United States and international markets. Additionally, the brand is gaining from the positive customer response to product innovations, emerging categories and overall customer experience.Potential Strategic InitiativesAbercrombie has been gaining from focus on revival of its brands, enhancing performance and returning to profitable growth.

Also, in an attempt to enhance margins, the company keeps its discounts low along with a check on promotional activities.Final ThoughtsWhile all is well with Abercrombie, dismal performance at its namesake brand continues to impede results. Though the brand showed a marked improvement in the recent holiday period, a full turnaround is still away. Additionally, the company’s margins continue to be under pressure due to ongoing strategic initiatives to improve profitability.Nevertheless, Abercrombie’s robust strategic initiatives along with continued strength at its Hollister brand will aid growth in the near term.Do Apparel Stocks Grab Your Attention?

The metric return on equity goes a long way in resolving this issue.The metric enables investors to differentiate between a profit-churner and a profit-burner. It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity.But to fine-tune this basic concept, one can land on DuPont analysis. This theory will take investors a step higher and better pick some quality stocks.  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont?Although one can’t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn’t always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company’s leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company’s financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task. Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis.Screening Parameters• Profit Margin more than or equal to 3: As the name suggests, it is a measure of how profitably the business is running. Generally, it is the key contributor to ROE.• Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2: It allows an investor to assess management’s efficiency in using assets to drive sales.• Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3: It’s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets.• Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment.• Current Price more than $5: This screens out the low priced stocks. However, when looking for lower priced stocks, this criterion can be removed.Here are five of 16 stocks that made it through the screen:PetMed Express Inc.

2228,GPS,"Shares of women’s fashion boutique Francesca's FRAN plummeted to a new 52-week low on Monday after the struggling company announced the departure of a top executive.The boutique chain announced that its chief merchandising officer and executive vice president, Laurie Hummel, who previously held leadership positions at Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Macy's (M  -  Free Report), is set to leave the company after less than two years at Francesca's.It is unclear at this point if Hummel was relieved of her duties or if she stepped away, but Francesca's now finds itself in flux during a tumultuous time for retail.“We have a lot of talent in our merchandising team and are confident in their ability to execute our strategy as we search for a new Chief Merchant,” Francesca's President and CEO Steve Lawrence said in a statement. “During this period, the team will report directly to me. We wish Laurie well in her future endeavors.” Francesca's also released some preliminary results for the company’s upcoming second-quarter earnings report. The Houston-based retailer expects its quarterly comparable store sales to fall by 3% from the year-ago period. Francesca's also projects to report second-quarter earnings of $0.20 per share, which surpassed the company’s previous expectations.“That said, we note that back-to-school has been off to a very challenging start and our comparable sales have further decelerated from July,” Lawrence continued. “We will provide additional detail on our second quarter performance, as well as discuss our third quarter and full year outlook, on our upcoming earnings call.”Shares of Francesca's plummeted by over 10% on Monday morning to touch a new 52-week low of $6.71 a share. The stock now hovers down around 7% through mid-afternoon trading.Francesca's is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but scored an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth and Momentum in our Style Scores system, giving it an overall VGM grade of an “A.” The fashion retail company is set to report its second-quarter results on September 6.Retail Sector Francesca's is a small company with a market cap of roughly $275 million, so even though its shares have traded hands over four times above its average volume on Monday, it isn’t likely to drag the whole retail sector down with it. But the fact that the company cited poor back to school sales as a reason for its projected revenue decline might frighten some retail investors.Shares of fellow fashion-focused retailers, such as American Eagle (AEO  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), and The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) all fell on Monday. American Eagle took the biggest hit, as its shares dipped by 3.83%, also touching a new 52-week low.Shares of retail sector ETFs also fell on Monday. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), the Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), and the PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) all dropped marginally. The Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) dipped by 2.17% and touched a new 52-week low at $21.22 a share.However, shares of some of retail’s biggest names, including Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report) Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), and Macy's (M  -  Free Report) all saw marginal gains.

2229,GPS,"With store expansion efforts on track, Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to inaugurate a Nordstrom Rack store at the Orchard Town Center in Westminster, CO, in spring 2019. Spanning across 25,000 square feet, the new store marks the seventh Rack store in the state.This new outlet will share space with various restaurants and specialty shops as well as renowned retailers, including Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), AMC Theatres, H&M, REI and Gap Inc.’s (GPS  -  Free Report) Old Navy.Situated off I-25 in the northern Denver metro area, The Orchard Town Center is an open-air retail and entertainment platform, which is owned and supervised by Phoenix-based Vestar. Nordstrom is likely to gain from this convenient location and better cater to its customers by its top-tier merchandise offerings.Being the off-price retail segment of the company, Nordstrom Rack offers fashion-savvy customers a wide range of on-trend apparel, footwear and other accessories at discounted prices. These Racks usually keep items from the main Nordstrom stores as well as online store, Nordstrom.com. Also, these stores stack products from other major brands sold by the company.Notably, the company has three full-line stores in the state of Colorado, alongside six Rack outlets. In fiscal 2017, management intends to introduce 11 Rack stores, and will relocate one store. In addition, the company is on track with domestic store expansion. It is scheduled to inaugurate two full-line store relocations in California in October, at Westfield Century City in Los Angeles and at University Towne Center in La Jolla.As of Aug 18, 2017, the company operates 354 outlets across 40 states. Its portfolio also includes 122 full-line stores across the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada, two Jeffrey boutiques, 221 Nordstrom Racks and two clearance stores.Prior to this Westminster store, the company announced plans to introduce a Rack store at The Promenade at Town Center in Santa Clarita, CA, which is slated to open doors in spring 2018.Interestingly, with digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including the big-box ones, are struggling to compete with eCommerce bigwigs and are being forced to curb their store count to focus more on an online model.On the contrary, Nordstrom is a resilient company that continues with its store expansion plans despite a challenging retail backdrop.Furthermore, we laud the company’s cost-saving initiatives and progress on 2020 strategy. Though its growth strategy bodes well, investments toward occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are likely to weigh upon its near-term cost and margin performance.However, its strategic efforts are well reflected in the stock performance. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gained 4.4% in the last three months against the industry’s decline of 16.9%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2230,GPS,"In a bid to impress investors, Dillard’s, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) has recently approved a quarterly dividend hike of 42.9% to 10 cents per share compared with the previous payout of 7 cents. The new dividend will be paid on Class A and Class B common stock on Oct 30, to shareholders of record as on Sep 29, 2017.Moreover, the company’s constant efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities in its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce business bode well. Its focus on increasing productivity, enhancing domestic operations and boosting shareholder’s return are also noteworthy.In fact, these attributes are well reflected in the company’s stock price movement. Shares of Dillard’s have rallied 9.7% in the last three months against the industry’s decline by an equivalent rate. Also, its shares have outperformed the broader Retail-Wholesale sector that gained a meager 0.5% and is currently placed at the bottom 6% of the Zacks classified sectors (15 out of 16).Let’s Delve DeepStrategic EndeavorsDillard’s enjoys a niche position among fashion apparel, cosmetics and home furnishing retailers. We believe that the company’s strategy of offering fashion-forward and trendy products, store remodels and omnichannel initiatives acts as a catalyst for attracting more customers, consequently leading to overall growth.Furthermore, Dillard’s efforts to increase its shareholders’ value are evident from dividend payout of $4.5 million in the first half of fiscal 2017. Also, it bought back 1.4 million shares for $69.5 million in the fiscal second quarter, which represents a total of 3.1 million shares for $160.6 million on a year-to-date basis. Along with this, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had authorization worth $93.2 million remaining as of Jul 29, 2017.Concerns/HurdlesHowever, Dillard’s incurred loss of 58 cents per share in the most recent quarter, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. In fact, its bottom line has also fallen short of the estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 100.8%. Management blamed the quarterly loss on considerable markdowns in the quarter. Though its top line dropped year over year, the same surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.37 for fiscal 2017 and $3.12 for fiscal 2018 has moved down 64 cents and 57 cents, respectively, over the last 30 days.Furthermore, Dillard’s has been plagued with the persistent challenging trends in the apparel retail segment. Also, stiff competition and consumers’ changing preferences toward online shopping are weighing down on its performance.Bottom LineAlthough Dillard’s is facing a number of challenges now, management is striving hard to spark a turnaround in its performance.  Still Interested in the Retail Space–A few better-ranked stocks in the broader Retail sector are The Children's Place, Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report), The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Children's Place, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 9% has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 16.3% in the last four quarters.Gap, Inc., with a long-term earnings growth rate of 8% has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 9.3% in the last four quarters.Canada Goose Holdings, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 34.1% has delivered positive earnings surprise of 33.3% in the last reported quarter.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2231,GPS,"Benchmarks declined 1% on Thursday with the Dow snapping its four-day winning streak to end in the red. Dismal earnings results from Cisco weighed on the Dow. Moreover, speculations regarding Gary Cohn’s resignation from the post of chief economic advisor to President Trump and the terrorist attack in Barcelona also hurt the investor sentiment. The S&P 500 suffered its worst performance of the year with all its sectors ending in the red. The Nasdaq declined due to a slump in tech shares and posted its third worst performance for the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,750.73, declining 1.2% or 274.14 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.5% or 38.10 points to close at 2,430.01. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,221.91, decreasing 123.19 points or 1.9%. A total of around 6.7 billion shares were traded on Thursday, above the last 20-session average of 6.3 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 4.55-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 3.89-to-1 ratio.Cisco Disappoints, Drags the Dow LowerDow ended its four-day winning streak and finished to close at its lowest levels since May 17. The blue-chip index had amassed 180 points during its four day winning streak. The biggest drag on the Dow was a decline in shares of Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) after the revenues from its security business fell in the previous quarter. This negated the overall profits that the company incurred for fourth quarter 2017. Its revenues declined 4% year over year to $12.13 billion, slightly better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Management had anticipated revenues to decline in the range of 6-4% on a year-over-year basis. (Read More: Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) Meets Q4 Earnings Estimates, Revenues Beat)Also, Walmart’s (WMT  -  Free Report) dismal performance in the second quarter weighed on the Dow. It posted adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share, just beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and prior-year quarter’s adjusted earnings of $1.07. In an unforgiving retail landscape, this small earnings beat and miniscule year-over-year growth was enough to send the company’s stock lower on Thursday morning. (Read More: Walmart's Earnings Report Just Proved It's a Legit Amazon Competitor)The index also took a battering after news regarding Gary Cohn’s resignation engulfed the market. There were widespread fears regarding Cohn, a business advisor to the President, could resign from his post as director of National Economic Council due to Trump’s remarks on the Charlottesville incident. This comes after the President himself disbanded two advisory panels, the Manufacturing Council and Strategic and Policy Forum, after top corporate leaders resigned from their positions in the respective panels. These fears impacted the overall market and brought about broad based losses.Cohn’s resignation from the post would’ve crushed all hopes for tax and regulatory reforms which the investors are hopeful of. However, the Dow could trim the losses briefly after the news was out that Cohn’s resignation was just a speculation and he would continue his term with the advisory panel. Later in the day, the White House issued an official statement which said that Cohn would not be resigning from his post. Even after the official statement was out, the losses could not be negated and Dow still ended in the red.S&P 500, Nasdaq Suffer Worst PerformancesThe S&P 500 suffered its worst performance for the year on Thursday after it declined more than one 1%, with all of its primary sectors finishing in the negative territory, led by technology sector. This has happened on only two other occasions this year. The overall technology sector was down due to broad based losses in the information technology shares. The Select Sector SPDR for Technology (XLK) dipped almost 2%. The overall markets dropped on Thursday not only because of speculations regarding Cohn’s resignation but also due to the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain. The S&P 500 is trading 2.1% off its closing high for the year.The Nasdaq also slumped almost 2% due to broad based losses in the market, registering its third largest daily loss for the year. Also, the Russell 2000 index closed below its 200-days moving average.Economic DataThe Initial Jobless Claims for the month of August fell 3.7% to 232,000 whereas the consensus estimated it to decrease to 241,000. The industrial production showed an increased to 0.2% from the last month whereas the consensus estimated it to increase by 0.3% from the previous month.

2232,GPS,"Only days before Black Friday, shares of some of the biggest U.S. retailers, including Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), sunk on Tuesday after DSW (DSW  -  Free Report) reported lower than expected third-quarter results and weakened fourth quarter guidance.DSW failed to meet third-quarter earnings estimates, citing negative impact from the wave of early fall tropical storms and hurricanes, along with warmer than usual weather. Although the discount shoe retailer’s third-quarter revenues rose 1.7%, they missed expectations, and comparable store sales fell 0.4%.On top of that, DSW updated its full-year outlook and now expects earnings to fall between $1.40 and $1.45 per share, which reflects the retailer’s newly lowered expectations. Furthermore, the company noted that one of its newest acquisitions, Ebuys—bought in the hopes of boosting its online presence—is not performing up to expectations.""At Ebuys, we've moderated the long-term financial expectations and have reduced its carrying value on our balance sheet,” CEO Roger Rawlins said in a statement. Shares of DSW tumbled over 11% in morning trading after it released its third-quarter earnings report. Before Tuesday’s descent, DSW stock had dipped roughly 0.50% since the start of the year.DSW’s rough Q3 also has some investors dumping other notable retailer players far beyond the scope of the shoe industry.Other Retailers Macy’s shares dipped over 1.50%, while Nordstrom saw its stock price sink by as much as 1.70%. Dillard’s stock dropped by more than 2.33%, and Kohl’s (KSS) experienced a marginal decline. DSW’s poor performance and lowered guidance also negatively impacted shares of American Eagle (AEO  -  Free Report) and The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report). Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) also dipped, while sports footwear retailer, Finish Line  stock sank by over 1.80%.Retail sector ETFs also fell on Tuesday. Shares of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) dropped over 1%, while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) dipped over 2.60%.This downturn, directly ahead of what has become retail’s most important week, does not bode well for the industry. It’s also worth noting that DSW is not known to be a bellwether for the retail industry, which could mean retail investors are simply skittish overall.What might make investors even more nervous is that, over the last decade, this two-week period has proven to be one of the industry’s strongest. In fact, since 2007, retail is the top U.S. equities sector during the week before and after Black Friday, according to CNBC analysis.Now, only three days away from Black Friday and the start of the holiday shopping season, retailers and investors will hope customers eager for deals come out in droves.Luckily, this year—despite pushback against the now decades-long practice and an overall retail shift—the National Retail Federation estimates 164 million people plan to shop on Black Friday, which is up from 87 million in 2014 (also read: A Complete History of 'Black Friday').Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

2235,GPS,"Holiday season and retail are synonymous, and with the festive season approaching, the sector is back in spotlight. Just like every year, retailers are busy with preparations to make the most of this solid selling period. In keeping with this trend, Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) will hire nearly 13,650 workers to handle the rush, higher than the previous year’s hiring of approximately 11,400 seasonal employees.Notably, Nordstrom’s seasonal employees will cater to customers across all its stores including the Rack stores along with its distribution and fulfillment centers. Further, some of the employees will look after its online operations, Hautelook and Trunk Club customers.Incidentally, roughly 8,200 seasonal employees will be recruited for 122 Nordstrom stores across the United States and Canada, and 3,200 for 1127 Nordstrom Rack stores. Additionally, the company plans to hire about 2,200 workers for its stores and e-commerce operations at its fulfillment and distribution centers across various states.These seasonal roles will include both part-time and full-time positions, with the opportunity for some workers to become regular employees. This fashion specialty retailer believes that the improved staffing will help it to better serve customers during the busiest time of the year.Notably, during the holiday season retailers stay on their toes, flooding the market with offers and promotions. They sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases. Since the season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits, retailers grab every opportunity to drive footfall.Apart from Nordstrom, other retail bellwethers like Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), among others have adopted the same strategy to tap maximum holiday sales.Stocks PerformanceIn the past one month, the company’s shares have declined 12.4%, wider than the industry’s fall of 5.1%. The recent decline in share price was primarily due to Nordstrom family’s plans to take the company private are on hold for the time being. The Nordstrom family, which has been exploring options to fund the privatization for a while now, informed the “Special Committee” that it has deferred the search process for the rest of the year.While the Nordstrom family alias the Group notified that it plans to resume exploration initiatives after the holiday season. However, it remains to be seen if any deal can actually surface amid the tough retail landscape. Though the possibility of finding a lender may depend on Nordstrom’s performance in this crucial selling season, some reports suggest that it depends on the overall holiday season scenario.Nordstrom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2241,GPS,"Staples, Inc.  is expected to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 16. In the previous quarter, the company had reported in-line earnings. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Stapleswill be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 12 cents, flat year over year. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,833 million, declining over 19% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayStaples which has accepted the buyout offer of Sycamore Partners is likely to gain from its decision to streamline operations to enhance productivity and performance in North America by expanding services, strengthening customer base, shutting down underperforming stores along with decreasing fixed costs.With respect to the cost containment efforts, management is employing a more efficient customer coverage model, focusing on lowering indirect procurement costs, enhancing supply chain and increasing mix of Staples’ brand products.However, stiff competition and sluggish demand for paper-based office products due to technological advancements remain major woes for Staples. Decline in sales have also been a concern for the company. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, sales declined 4.9% year over year. We noted that the sales have declined 3.1%, 3.7%, 4.3% and 2.9% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively.Staples, Inc.

In the trailing four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.1%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.How are Estimates Shaping Up?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether L Brands will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 45 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 35%. We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by 3 cents in the past 30 days.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  L Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | L Brands, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayL Brands continues to disappoint investors with dismal comparable sales (comps) performance. This specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products reported 7% drop in comps for the four-week ended Jul 29, 2017 following declines of 9%, 7%, 5%, 10%,13%, 4% and 1% in June, May, April, March, February, January and December, respectively.For the 13-week ended Jul 29, 2017, the company’s comps had declined 8%, while sales decreased 4.7% to $2.755 billion. L Brands’ comps declined 14% at Victoria’s Secret but increased 6% at Bath & Body Works. The exit from the swim and apparel categories had a 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points adverse impact on overall company and Victoria’s Secret comparable sales, respectively.However, we believe that the company’s operational efficiencies, together with its new and innovative collections may help augment sales. Further, its foray into international markets is likely to provide long-term growth opportunities and generate increased sales volumes. Management now envisions second-quarter earnings to be at the high end of its previously provided guidance range of 40–45 cents a share.What Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that L Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

2243,GPS,"Brush off market volatility, here’s some good news to cherish. With unemployment rate still at a 17-year low, initial jobless claims below the psychological mark, consumer spending being impressive and government expenditure increasing, things appear to be fairly rosy for the U.S. economy. These sentiments were rekindled when the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its third and final estimate for real GDP yesterday.Markedly, real GDP rose 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, higher than the second estimate of 2.5% and analysts’ expectations of 2.7%. Moreover, real GDP for 2017 climbed 2.3% from the 2016 level, much better than 1.5% growth witnessed in 2016. Also, consumer spending (accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity) grew 4% in the fourth quarter, marking its highest improvement since the fourth quarter of 2014.Apart from this, the favorable economic indicators led to a sixth Fed rate hike last week (since the financial crisis), which was also followed by a raised GDP outlook for 2018. The Fed officials now envision GDP growth rate to be 2.7% up from 2.5% for the year, which may witness two more rate hikes. While President Trump’s latest take on trade policies may hurt business sentiment and expenditure on capital goods, analysts expect government spending and the $1.5-trillion tax cuts to boost economic growth in 2018.Retail Space Rides on Favorable Indicators Clearly, these factors bode well for the Retail-Wholesale sector that has surged 24.6% in a year, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 12.4%. As consumers form the lifeline of the sector, metrics like consumer spending and consumer sentiment remain the deciding factor of the retail space’s fate. Though soft traffic and mounting competition due to consumers’ evolving shopping patterns have made things challenging for retailers, they’re exploiting every nook and cranny to keep pace with the changing trends.

2245,GPS,"Markets closed higher on Thursday after the House finally passed the much awaited tax legislation as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Moreover, broader markets were also boosted after shares of both Cisco as well as Wal-Mart surged after the companies posted stupendous earnings. Meanwhile, the industrial production in October increased 0.9%.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 0.8%, to close at 23,458.36. The S&P 500 Index (INX) gained 0.8% to close at 2,585.64. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,793.29, gaining 1.3%. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.23-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered the declining ones by a 3.59-to-1. The CBOE VIX decreased 9.4% to close at 11.90.Tax Bill Cleared by the HouseIn a 227 to 205 vote on Thursday, House of Representatives finally passed the much awaited tax cuts legislation now named as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This not only refurbished the existing U.S. tax code but also took President Trump and his team one step closer toward realizing their most important agenda — tax reforms.Members of the GOP remained positive about the how the Bill would actually improve the overall economy. House Speaker, Paul Ryan even commented that the legislation would result in more jobs, increased wages and above all, ‘better take-home pay.’ The Bill reduces the corporate tax rate to 20% from the current rate of 35%.It also reduces tax brackets to just four slabs from the current seven slabs and also revokes the estate tax system. Eventually, the United States will move to a territorial tax system, under which a company can be taxed only where income is earned.Not so surprisingly, none of the Democrats cast their vote for the Bill. Moreover, Republicans from New York and New Jersey also did not vote for the legislation. In all, thirteen Republicans refused to vote for the Bill. Such Republicans particularly did not support the abolishment of state and local income tax deductions under the Bill.Economists believe that the Bill has yet to clear the biggest hurdle. This would be Senate Finance Committee’s proposal to delay the implementation of the corporate tax cut — the most important facet of the legislation — to 2019. However, broader markets gained traction on Thursday after the Tax Bill was passed by the House.What Do the Benchmarks Say?The Dow amassed 187.08 points to close in the green on Thursday. This comes just a day after the blue-chip index posted its worst one-day drop since Sep 5. While gains for the Dow were boosted primarily by the Tax Bill being passed in the House, a surge in the shares of Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) helped the blue-chip index post a brilliant show. This also led to the Dow gaining more than 200 points earlier in the session.Shares of Cisco gained 5.2% on Thursday after posting stupendous earnings for first quarter of fiscal 2018. Cisco Systems Inc. reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 61 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the figure remained unchanged on a year-over-year basis. Acquisitions have negatively impacted earnings by a penny in the quarter. Revenues declined 1.7% year over year to $12.14 billion and were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. (Read More)Whereas the shares of Wal-Mart gained almost 11% after posting third quarter 2017 earnings which surpassed the expectations. The Arkansas-based retailer posted $123.18 billion in quarterly revenues and adjusted EPS of $1.00 per share, which both beat Wall Street expectations. Wal-Mart also raised its full-year earnings guidance to help its stock price hit a new intraday trading high of $98.01 per share. (Read More)Such gains also boosted the S&P 500 which surged 21.02 points. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, nine ended in the green, with tech shares leading the advancers. The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) surged 1.4%. Such gains were made possible by a surge in the shares of Cisco after posting an earnings beat.

2246,GPS,"The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) has been in investors’ good books due to its new growth strategy, solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Further, the company has been making constant efforts to boost digital and mobile offerings, alongside improving product acceptance. This apart, the company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 8% highlights its inherent strength.Solid Surprise History and Outlook Reflect Focus on Growth PlansThe success of Gap’s aforementioned endeavors is clearly visible from the company’s surprise history and upbeat outlook for fiscal 2017. Evidently, Gap’s second-quarter fiscal 2017 marked its second successive earnings beat, while sales delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of positive surprise. Also, comps grew year over year for the third straight quarter, primarily driven by continued strength at the Old Navy brand, which was fueled by improved traffic. Though Gap’s namesake brand witnessed a year-over-year drop in comps, results grew sequentially backed by better product quality.Clearly, Gap’s growth initiatives are paying off, which along with a solid first half encouraged management to raise earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017. It now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $2.02-$2.10 per share compared with the previous range of $1.95-$2.05.Focus on Athleta and Old Navy — New Growth StrategyAs part of its new growth strategy, Gap now focused on its two growth brands — Old Navy and Athleta. The company expects net sales of more than $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, at each of the brands over the next few years, with these gains stemming from U.S. store expansion along with mobile and e-commerce growth. Additionally, the company plans to open 270 Old Navy and Athleta stores, while simultaneously closing 200 underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores over the next three years.The company anticipates these new strategies will create about $500 million in expense savings over the next three years, and the company added that it plans to reinvest a portion of those savings in its growth goals.Other Growth Endeavors on TrackIn addition to the new growth strategy, Gap continues with other strategic initiatives in order to keep track with the evolving apparel industry and competitors like Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report), Zumiez Inc.  and American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report).In this regard, the company has accelerated the pact of its transformation plan by bringing meaningful changes to its product portfolio and operating capabilities worldwide. Further, management remains keen on streamlining operating model by creating a more proficient global brand structure, which will enable its brands to utilize scale advantages more efficiently.Further, the company is enhancing e-Commerce and omni-channel capabilities by adopting a number of initiatives. Notably, the company has increased online presence across all of its brands, and its online division is one of its most profitable, posting double-digit sales growth. Recently, the company announced plans to launch the buy online, pick-up in store service, a new personalization engine that is powered by customer data, and continued significant investment in omni-channel services. As part of its omni-channel endeavors, Gap previously extended the “find-in-store”, “Reserve-in-Store” and “Order in Store” capabilities across various stores.We believe that all these initiatives, combined with constant digital investments should boost Gap’s top-line in the long run.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2249,GPS,"With Thanksgiving around the corner, the retail industry’s prospects are squarely in focus. Retail is possibly the most visible face of consumer spending, which has powered the recent spurt in U.S. economic growth. But over the last few years, the industry’s landscape has undergone several radical changes. The most important of these is possibly the tussle between brick and mortar formats and exclusive online stores.Around this time last year, it seemed that e-commerce was easily winning the battle. This is likely the case even now, with several retail majors expanding their online presence significantly. However, some brick and mortar chains are resisting the temptation to go online and have found new ways to fight the retail battle.Battling a Retail CollapseNearly 16 million individuals are employed by the U.S. retail sector, making it a significant cog in the country’s economic engine. However, several of them have been forced to shutter several stores after failing to fend off online competition. And troubles don’t end there for this category. Several big names have even had to file for bankruptcy this year.To provide a small illustration, in 2017 alone, Sears Holdings Corporation  has shuttered more than 350 Sears and K-mart stores. Meanwhile, The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) have shut down 200 and 140 stores, respectively.But it isn’t that sales have completely fallen away for these traditional retail mainstays. Instead, several retailers with an online presence are witnessing a migration from brick and mortar outlets to their company websites.Online, Offline or a Mix of Both?This migration toward online portals has forced retailers to come up with methods to balance their online and offline presence. For instance, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is following a two-pronged strategy of increasing its online presence and slashing prices. Meanwhile, nearly half of its online purchases are either being shipped from stores or being picked up from brick and mortar outlets by customers.Also, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has decided to adjust its pricing strategy in order to find the right online-offline balance. The iconic retailer has recently decided to raise online prices for certain products for which shipping costs are significantly high. This move makes store prices for certain items cheaper, which means that it’s a strategy that could backfire for online focused customers.How Dollar Tree is Winning the FightHowever, some discount chains have not had to depend heavily on the online route to remain afloat in this fiercely competitive environment. One of them is Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), which posted impressive third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21. Comparable store sales (comps) for the quarter increased 3.2% in constant-currency, driven by improved customer count and average ticket. (Read: Dollar Tree Stock Jumps on Q3 Earnings Beat, View Up)At the heart of its recent success have been store remodeling efforts and a decision to expand its food offerings. According to Dollar Tree’s CEO Gary Philbin, strong consumables sales have fueled overall sales during the last quarter. Further, the company provided 125 additional Dollar Tree stores with refrigeration facilities. Dollar Tree has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Taking a Leaf out of Aldi’s Book?Dollar Tree has also been gaining from the integration of Family Dollar, which is contributing significantly to the company’s results. Philbin said better food merchandizing led to a rise in sales at Family Dollar outlets during the third quarter. Such strategies are similar to Germany’s retail giant Aldi which announced ambitious U.S. expansion plans this year.One of the biggest reasons behind Aldi’s discount business model is that 90% of the products are Aldi-exclusive brands, letting the grocer provide high-quality product without the hidden costs of advertising and marketing usually associated with national name brands. (Read: Why Aldi is the Grocery Store of the Future)The Way AheadMost traditional retailers are choosing to take a middle path, striking a delicate balance between their online and offline efforts. But the success of discount stores like Dollar Tree and Aldi indicates that the American consumer is willing to opt for brick and mortar outlets ahead of their online counterparts if they provide strong product offerings at reasonable prices. Clearly, the days of brick and mortar stores are far from over.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

While these estimates reflect growth of 3% for Gap Global and 0.9% for Old Navy Global, it reveals a decline of 6.7% for the Banana Republic Global segment, compared with the last quarter.Factors at PlayGap’s shares have gained 14.4% year to date, as against the industry’s decline of 20.6%. This performance was driven by its solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Meanwhile, the company has been making constant efforts to boost its digital and mobile offerings, besides improving product acceptance. Also, Gap’s new growth strategy focused on growing its Old Navy and Athleta brands looks promising.However, results continue to be soft at the company’s namesake and Banana Republic brands. Moreover, going forward, management expects SG&A expenses to increase at a higher rate than the first half. This mainly stems from increased product, marketing and digital investments for the significant back-to-school selling season. The company expects the rise in costs to hurt its bottom line.Further, Gap’s significant international presence exposes it to adverse currency fluctuations. Though the company’s earnings and sales topped estimates in the previous quarter, currency headwinds caused results to decline year over year. Unfortunately, management expects these hurdles to persist in fiscal 2017, which in turn might dent the quarterly results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Gap is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

2251,GPS,"After the news of an uptick in the U.S. economy with GDP expanding at a 3% annual rate in the third quarter, retailers got another reason to smile just ahead of the festive season. Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — reached its highest level in almost 17 years. Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 125.9 last month from September’s revised reading of 120.6.Analysts believe that buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to 16-year low, and a lift in the economic activity post-hurricanes were enough to boost consumer sentiment. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help increase sales.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economic activity, surged 1% in September, recording its biggest monthly increase in almost eight years. The rise in spending was led by robust sales of autos and other durable items. All these sound favorable for retailers, who try to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits.Holiday Season: Likely Bonanza for RetailersWe are entering the festive season with Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and of course Christmas lined up to take you on a holiday shopping spree. Competition will certainly be tough, be it at the brick-and-mortar stores or online portals, the retailers need to be hawk-eyed.

Data compiled by the nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.The data unveiled by Kantar suggests that sales during the fourth-quarter holiday period is expected to jump 3.7%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Retailers such as Macy’s, Inc.

2254,GPS,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) shares tanked 16.6% on Aug 11 as the company failed to impress investors with its quarterly numbers, when it posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. In fact, the stock has witnessed a decline of 65.2% in the past one year, wider than the industry’s slump of 39.7%. The company’s bottom-line came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate after beating the same in the trailing nine quarters. Even its top-line which surpassed the estimate for the first time after missing the same in the preceding five quarters failed to cushion the stock.Let’s Unveil the PictureJ. C. Penney posted loss per share of 9 cents wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents. In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported adjusted loss of 5 cents. Moreover, the company delivered net loss of $62 million or 20 cents on a GAAP basis, wider than the net loss of $56 million or 18 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Further, it not only reported widening net loss but also dismal comparable sales.The company’s total net sales of $2,962 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,870 million and increased 1.5% year over year, after witnessing a decrease of 3.7% in the preceding quarter. Further, the company witnessed sequential increase in apparel business, driven by substantial improvement in kids’ apparel. However, comparable-store sales (comps) decreased 1.3%, compared with an increase of 2.2% in the prior-year quarter.Sturdy performance was witnessed across Sephora, Home, Salon and Fine Jewelry divisions. Management remains optimistic about roll out of appliances, new Sephora locations, center core refreshes, in-store.com fulfillment and buy online, pick up in store same day initiative.Gross profit in the quarter decreased 4.2% to $1,039 million, while gross margin contracted 200 basis points (bps) to 35.1%. J. C. Penney’s adjusted EBITDA improved to $196 million from $233 million in the prior-year quarter, while adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 160 bps to 6.6%.Strategic InitiativesIn an effort, to achieve sustainable growth J. C. Penney had earlier announced strategic initiatives, wherein it shut down 138 stores and is further planning to close two distribution centers. The company stated that it had already closed 127 stores during second quarter. During the quarter under review, liquidation of inventory from these stores impacted the gross margin by 120 bps. These strategic efforts will not only help the company to align its brick-and-mortar presence but will also help it utilize capital resources in locations where it has ample opportunity.The closure of stores, which represents nearly 13–14% of the company’s store portfolio, is likely to hurt total annual sales by 5%. Further, EBITDA will come down by less than 2% but most importantly it will not affect net income.These stores were not only reporting dismal comps in comparison with the remaining store base but were also being operated at higher cost. The company anticipates annual saving of nearly $200 million from the store closure program.J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company QuoteFinancial DetailsJ. C.

2255,GPS,"Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 16. Well the obvious question that comes to mind is will this operator of general merchandise stores be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 16.5%.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is $1.20 down from $1.23 reported in the year-ago period. We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved by 15 cents in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16,220 million.Factors at PlayWe believe that Target’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores bode well. Management plans to expand its merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well and recently rolled out Target Restock program. Moreover, the company has also adopted an aggressive cost reduction strategy, including rationalization of supply chain, technology and process improvements. These initiatives are significant in the light of waning top and bottom lines.The company now expects to post positive comparable sales for the first time in five quarters and envisions earnings per share to top the upper end of its guidance range of 95 cents to $1.15, when it reports second-quarter results. Improved sales and traffic trends witnessed during the first two months of the quarter, prompted management to raise its forecast, which otherwise had earlier projected low-single digit decline in comparable sales. We noted that comparable sales had decreased 1.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, following declines of 1.5%, 0.2% and 1.1% in the fourth, third and second quarters of fiscal 2016.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Target is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

2256,GPS,"Coach, Inc. , which is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15, has seen shares rising roughly 5% in the past three months. The stock has comfortably outperformed the broader Consumer Discretionary sector that gained 3.4%. Per the latest Earnings Preview, Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to witness earnings growth of 6.2% and revenue increase of 8.8% this reporting cycle. Let’s take a closer look as to how Coach is expected to contribute to the sector’s performance.What to Expect from Coach?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts as well as house of lifestyle brands will be able to continue with its positive earnings surprise streak in the quarter to be reported. The company’s past performance reveals that it had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing 13 quarters. In the preceding four quarters, it had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 5.5%.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 49 cents compared with 45 cents posted in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,147 million marginally down from $1,155 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Coach, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Coach, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coach, Inc. QuoteFactors at Play Coach is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade & Company are being viewed as a significant step in efforts toward becoming a multi-brand company. Moreover, management has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product, stores and marketing, which are likely to have a favorable impact in the quarter to be reported. The company continues to anticipate double-digit growth in earnings per share for the fiscal year.Due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar, management envisions low-single digit increase in fiscal 2017 revenue. Third-quarter net sales came in at $995.2 million, down about 4% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis. Sales growth were hurt by 150 basis points on account of management’s efforts to elevate the Coach brand’s positioning in the North American wholesale channel by lowering promotional events and door closures. We noted that the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,018 million, marking the third straight quarter of revenue miss.Coach sells products that are discretionary in nature, and in turn depends upon consumers’ disposable income. Further, its customers remain sensitive to macroeconomic factors, which if not favorable may negatively impact discretionary spending, and in turn the company’s growth and profitability.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Coach is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Most Accurate estimate is at 50 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 49 cents.

2257,GPS,"A glimpse of L Brands, Inc.’s (LB  -  Free Report) share price movement reveals that it has plunged roughly 36.4% so far in the year, wider than the industry’s decline of 27.9%. So what is behind the debacle? We have tried to ascertain major reasons that can be held responsible for this Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell) stock’s dismal show in the bourses.Declining CompsMajor chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping. L Brands continues to disappoint investors with soft comparable sales (comps) performance so far in the year. This specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products reported 2% drop in comps for the month of September, following declines of 4%, 7%, 9%, 7%, 5%, 10%,13% and 4% in August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively.The company continues to face short-term challenges due to its decision to exit the swimwear category, which according to analysts has failed to generate desired results. Management expects comps to decline in low-single digits in October. It projects comps (excluding Victoria's Secret swim and apparel) in the third quarter to be in the range of flat to down low-single digit. For fiscal 2017, the company envisions comps to be down low-to-mid-single digits.Waning Top & Bottom LinesL Brands dwindling top and bottom-line results remain the primary concern for investors. A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2017 unveils that net sales declined 7% and 5% in the first and second quarter, respectively. Maintaining the same chronological order, we note that earnings per share fell 44% and 31%, respectively. Moreover, the second quarter marked the fourth straight quarter when the company’s top-line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Management now projects earnings in the band of $3.00-$3.20 per share for fiscal 2017, down from the prior view of $3.10-$3.40 and also well below fiscal 2016 and 2015 earnings of $3.74 and $3.99, respectively. Moreover, the company envisions third-quarter earnings in the range of 25-30 cents, compared with prior-year quarter earnings of 42 cents.Gross Margin Continues to HurtGross margin has shown constant deceleration in the past few quarters. In first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted 320 and 120 basis points (bps) to 37.1% and 37.3%, respectively primarily due to buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage. We noted that gross margin have contracted 230 bps, 190 bps, 180 bps and 170 bps in the fourth, third, second, and first quarters of fiscal 2016 to 43.3%, 39.7%, 38.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Further, management anticipates gross margin to deteriorate year over year during the third quarter as well as fiscal 2017.Bottom LineUndoubtedly, aforementioned factors are enough to unnerve investors. Nevertheless, L Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. The company is focusing on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise, and speed-to-market initiatives.Can’t Get Over Retail?

QuoteBottom LineGrowth of the e-commerce industry, with an increasing number of consumers buying things online, is always a favorable factor for companies like Amazon. Product offerings, a superior user experience, bargains and customer feedback have further helped Amazon build a strong position for itself in the fast-growing e-commerce market.Moreover, the recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market by the e-commerce behemoth has given it an easy access to roughly more than 400 stores and a foothold in the grocery business. This is a big positive for the company.Now with the holiday season nearing, we believe Amazon is set to take advantage of the situation.Currently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Retailers are now concentrating more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Moreover, steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration are undoubted signs of economic recovery. These are playing a crucial role in raising buyers’ confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate in to higher consumer spending that may help rev up sales.Among the host of industries that builds up the overall Retail-Wholesale sector, we are focusing on Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, which occupies top 34% (91 out of 265) position.

2261,GPS,"After the news of an uptick in the U.S. consumer sentiment to 13-year high, retailers got another reason to smile just ahead of the festive season. U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in September, after a pullback in the month of August, on sturdy auto sales, rising gasoline prices and increased demand for building materials. This clearly indicates that the economy is gathering pace and setting the stage right for an upbeat holiday season.Analysts believe that a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to a 16-year low, and a lift in economic activity post hurricanes were enough to boost consumer sentiment. According to the data released by University of Michigan, consumer sentiment index surged to 101.1 in October from 95.1 in September. All this is music to retailers' ears as they try to make the most of the season, which accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits.Sturdy Retail SalesThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in September increased 1.6% to $483.9 billion, following a revised reading of a 0.1% decline registered in August. However, retail sales increased 4.4% from September 2016. The report suggests that sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers rose 3.6%, while receipts at gasoline stations and sales at building material dealers jumped 5.8% and 2.1%, respectively.Sales at electronics & appliance stores dipped 1.1%, while at clothing shops the same rose 0.4%. Meanwhile, food & beverage stores and general merchandise shops witnessed sales growth of 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 0.5% and increased 9.2% from the prior-year period.Holiday Season: A Likely Bonanza for RetailersWith September retail sales reaching a pinnacle after March 2015,  hopes have been raised for a blissful holiday season.

(AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Macy’s, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) are bracing up for the upcoming holiday season.Be it early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, retailers will go the extra mile. Since Christmas is falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day than last year and an extended weekend for last-minute purchasing.Data compiled by the nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. According to Deloitte, sales during the holiday season are likely to increase in the band of 4-4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%.Wrapping UpThe holiday season is nothing less than a battlefield for the retailers fighting hard to win over consumers and with technology playing a major role they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra.With the advent of the holiday season, the retail sector hogs all the attention.

2262,GPS,"Urban Outfitters, Inc. (URBN  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 15. In fact, this lifestyle specialty retailer witnessed negative earnings surprise for the last three quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average miss of 2.9%. This finds reflection in the stock’s performance.Shares of the company have plunged nearly 35% in the last six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 24.4%. On the contrary, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, which is currently placed at the bottom 13% of the Zacks classified sectors (14 out of 16), gained 9.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter has moved down by a penny to 37 cents in the last seven days. This reflects a year-over-year decline of over 43% from 66 cents. Also, the same was revised downward by 2 cents to $1.39 for fiscal 2018.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $867.5 million, down 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Urban Outfitters this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Urban Outfitters, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Urban Outfitters, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Urban Outfitters, Inc. QuoteUrban Outfitters has an Earnings ESP of -2.70%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 36 cents is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents. Moreover, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Note we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayChallenging retail landscape, aggressive pricing strategy, waning mall traffic and increased online competition are the major deterrents for Urban Outfitters. Investors’ sentiments were hurt when the company in a SEC filing unveiled that the comparable sales for the fiscal second quarter are deteriorating. Also, management anticipates gross margin rate to decrease year over year in the quarter due to rise in delivery and logistic expenses, higher markdowns and lower initial mark up. In fact, its gross margin has shown constant deceleration in the last three quarters.Further, Urban Outfitters’ sales have lagged the consensus mark for seven of the nine consecutive quarters, including the last reported quarter. Moreover, the company faces stiff competition in the retail segment from other department stores, discounters, home furnishing stores, specialty retailers and direct-to-consumer businesses on attributes such as merchandise assortment, price, quality, location and credit facility.Nevertheless, we expect the company to drive growth on the back of new store openings, increase in direct penetration, growing wholesale operations, technology advancements and merchandising improvements. Going forward, we believe that better product execution and effective inventory management may help augment its performance.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Gap, Inc.

Free cash flow in the period amounted to negative $30.2 million, significantly wider than negative $0.7 million in the prior-year period.Price competition remains a concern for Advance Auto Parts, as it competes with national and regional automotive retailers such as AutoZone, O’Reilly Automotive, Pep Boys and CSK Auto Corporation.Also, the improvement in the quality of new vehicles leads to reduced need for maintenance and repair of parts. This in turn, impedes demand in the automotive maintenance market. In addition, the fact that consumers are opting for new vehicle purchases instead of maintaining old ones, can affect the company products’ demand.Prior to its second-quarter earnings release, Zacks Consensus Estimate is showing a declining trend in the last one month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Although Kohl’s KSS and Dillard’s DDS beat some Wall Street estimates, weak sales figures continued, which prompted investors to run in fear on Thursday morning.Macy'sMacy’s (M  -  Free Report) reported earnings $0.48 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.45 a share. The company posted revenue of $5.55 billion, beating our Zacks estimate of $5.5 billion.

2265,GPS,"Retailer Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) posted impressive second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Shares of the retailer moved up more than 2.5% in the pre-market trading.Kohl’s reported adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 by 4.2%. Earnings also grew 2% from the prior-year quarter owing to improved sales trend in all lines of business, strong inventory and expense management.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteSales and MarginsNet sales of $4.144 billion marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.138 billion. However, it dipped 0.9% from the prior-year quarter due to a challenging sales environment and lower comparable store sales (comps). This signals that the company’s strategic initiative Greatness Agenda is failing to deliver results. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter 2014, was designed to increase transactions per store and sales. Though the plan has helped the company to deliver positive comps in all the four quarters of fiscal 2015, the quarterly growth rates were declining, thus posing a concern. Further, comps started declining since first-quarter fiscal 2016 and plummeted consecutively for the next six quarters, including the current one.Encouragingly, the 0.4% drop in comps in the second quarter was narrower than the preceding quarter’s decline of 2.7% and prior-year quarter’s decline of 1.8%, owing to increased traffic momentum witnessed in the second quarter. Though transactions for the quarter were lower than last year, they increased in the month of July, which also benefited the quarter.Gross margin declined only 6 basis points to 39.4% in the reported quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 0.3% to $983 million in the quarter.Other Financial DetailsAs of Jul 29, Kohl’s had $552 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.79 billion of long-term debt and $5.03 billion of shareholders’ equity. Cash flow from operations were $376 million, while capital expenditure were $399 million.On Aug 8, the Kohl's board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 55 cents per share, which will be paid on Sep 20, to shareholders of record as of Sep 6.Kohl’s ended the year with 1,154 Kohl's stores, 12 FILA Outlet stores, and four Off/Aisle clearance centers in 49 states.Our TakeWe note that Kohl’s has been struggling for the last few quarters to boost its sluggish top line. Lower spending on apparel and accessories and a general slowdown in consumer spending are hurting sales at department stores. Kohl's and its competitors have struggling in an intensely competitive market from online retailers.Nevertheless, Kohl’s has been making continuous efforts to improve its base business. Lately, the company has started offering more outside famous brands and cutting down on the number of in-house clothing brands it sells. The addition of Under Armour workout tights, sneakers and other gear in March was a great success and well-accepted among customers. It also helped to boost sales of the entire active apparel department in the first quarter despite decline in women's, children's and accessories units. Kohl's plans to start selling Clarks shoes for the back-to-school shopping season and is looking for other brands to add to store aisles. The company also plans to continue selling the best-selling of its private-label brands, such as Sonoma, Croft & Barrow and Apt. 9, in order to drive traffic.Kohl’s has also undertaken several initiatives to reduce its inventory to boost profits. During first-quarter fiscal 2017, the company made additional progress on its initiatives and as a result, inventory per store decreased 1%, while units per store were 5% lower. Lower inventory levels thus boosted earnings. The company continues to expect inventory to be down low to mid-single digits for the fiscal year 2017.We believe these efforts are well reflected in the share prices of the company. Notably, in the last three months, the stock has moved up 12.8% in comparison to the industry and the broader Retail and Wholesale sector. While the industry grew 6.0% in the last three months, the sector increased 2.9% in the said time frame.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksKohl’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the apparel industry include J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report). While J.C.

2267,GPS,"The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 17. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this international specialty retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 6.5% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Gap, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Gap, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 52 cents compared with 60 cents delivered in the year-ago quarter. However, we noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.8 billion, down 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Gap forms part of the Retail- Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to dip 0.9% year over year while revenues are projected to grow 4.1%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Well, our proven model shows that Gap may beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: Gap currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.85%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 54 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 52 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gap currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Gap’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected EarningsGap has been gaining from its turnaround efforts. The company is strongly focused on its strategic plans to keep track of the accelerated pace of change in the apparel industry. Further, Gap remains on track to speed up its transformation plan by bringing meaningful changes to its product portfolio and operating capabilities, worldwide. Other than this, the company is keen on streamlining its operating model by creating a more proficient global brand structure, and cutting costs. Moreover, Gap has been focused on augmenting omni-channel and digital operations, as evident from its various endeavors like “find-in-store” and “Reserve-in-Store” among others. These growth drivers, along with strength at its Old Navy brand helped the company to mark its fourth consecutive sales beat, in the previous quarter. Thus, we believe that all these initiatives are likely to help Gap deliver another impressive quarter.Though currency has long been a deterrent, all aforementioned catalysts have kept this California based company going even amid a challenging retail landscape. While Gap’s shares rose 5.9% so far this year, it fared much better than the industry’s 23.8% slump.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Big Lots, Inc.

2268,GPS,"On Monday, big box leader and cheap chic extraordinaire Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) announced that it will be upping its minimum hourly wage over the next few years, increasing it to $11 starting next month and committing to $15 by the end of 2020.Target has previously raised its minimum wage to $10 last May, and before that to $9 an hour in April 2015. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, which has not increased since July 2009.""Target has always offered market-competitive wages to our team members,"" CEO Brian Cornell said in prepared remarks. ""With this latest commitment, we'll be providing even more meaningful pay, as well as the tools, training, and support ... that set Target apart.""The pay initiative is another part of Target’s reinvention strategy that includes remodeling stores, growing its smaller store footprint (dubbed City Targets), and expanding and bettering its online presence. The company also hopes to use a higher minimum wage to “recruit and retain” top-level team members.Target said that the wage increase beginning in October will also apply to the 100,000 temporary employees the retailer plans to bring aboard ahead of the holiday season, a 43% increase from last year. The company also reiterated its sales and earnings outlook for the third-quarter and full year; this means that these new wage expenses “aren’t expected to impact the retailer's bottom line, as Target baked the wage hike into its $7 billion investment plan,” notes CNBC.Cornell went on to say that Target will address any potential impacts to company profits from the $15 wage at the retailer’s next analyst day for Wall Street this upcoming winter.Many other retailers have offered competitive minimum wages over the years. Rival Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) recently increased its own minimum hourly wage, raising entry-level hourly pay to $10 last year; the company, which is the country’s largest private employer, also raised wages to $9 an hour in 2015. Additionally, Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)-owned Whole Foods, Swedish giant Ikea, and even apparel retailer Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) have all boosted their own hourly pay for workers.  But how many will follow in Target’s $15-an-hour footsteps? That number gained serious traction during the last presidential campaign, and Democrats recently introduced a $15 minimum wage bill that is backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders. And, the city of Seattle is gradually increasing its hourly pay to $15, with many cities across the nation proposing similar legislation.However, it is much different for a private company to instill a minimum wage than it is for a city or a federal government. $15-an-hour, though, is hot right now, and there is no doubt Target is using it to help set it apart from other retailers.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

In a month, the stock has advanced 16.3%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 12.8%. The recent surge in stock price is big relief for investors, as the company has been grappling with a tough retail scenario for quite some time. Nevertheless, despite this bullish run in share price the company has still some concerns to address. So, is this gain short-lived or will the stock has more room to run? Let’s delve deeper and find out.Top Line Back on TrackJ. C. Penney, which reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results in August, impressed investors with its top-line performance. The company’s total net sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate after missing the same in the trailing five quarters. Moreover, total net sales also increased 1.5% in the second quarter, following a decline of 3.7% in the previous quarter. Further, the company witnessed sequential increase in apparel business, driven by substantial improvement in kids’ apparel. Sturdy performance was witnessed across Sephora, Home, Salon and Fine Jewelry divisions.Recently, in an effort to lure more customers and ramp up sales performance, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has enhanced the loyalty program which was introduced for the first time in 2008. Per the new reward program, every customer will get $10 reward for every 200 points earned. Further, there is no cap for receiving the reward of $10 per month.Stores Rationalization ProgramFurther, to better align stores with its omni-channel network and utilize capital resources in locations where the company has ample opportunity, J. C. Penney had earlier announced strategic initiatives, which include shutting of two distribution facilities as well as nearly 130-140 stores. The closure of stores, which represents nearly 13-14% of store portfolio, is likely to hurt total annual sales by less than 5%. The company expects annual saving of nearly $200 million from the store closure program.Sephora: One of the Driving FactorsThe in-store Sephora departments continue to outperform by drawing more customers. During fiscal 2016, the company opened 61 Sephora stores. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the company opened 32 Sephora stores and also completed the expansion of 31 Sephora stores. At the end of reported quarter, the total count of Sephora locations inside J. C. Penney was over 600 stores. In the third quarter, the company expects to open 38 new Sephora stores. Sephora is doing exceptionally well and is one of the best performing categories.Hurdles to CrossDecline in comparable sales has been a major concern for the investors. In the second quarter, comps decreased 1.3%, compared with an increase of 2.2% in the prior-year quarter. In the first quarter, comps have declined 3.5%. Comps had also declined in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2016, by 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. In fiscal 2017, the company anticipates comps to be in the range of down 1% to up 1%.Further, J. C. Penney continues to struggle with high-debt levels. At the end of the reported quarter, total long-term debt was $3,836 million, reflecting debt-to-capitalization ratio of 77.5%. Earlier, the company had announced plans to lower net debt to EBITDA ratio to less than three times by fiscal 2017.Hot Stocks in the Retail Space Worth Checking OutInvestors interested in the retail space may consider better-ranked stocks such as The Gap, Inc.

2272,GPS,"Macy's, Inc.‘s (M  -  Free Report) shares are riding high of late, driven by previously announced measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy and investment in omni-channel capabilities to improve performance. In a month, the stock has gained 11.7%, almost in line with the industry. Let’s delve deeper and find out whether the stock has the potential to gain further or not.Hidden CatalystWe believe that the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s sustained focus on price optimization, inventory management, merchandise planning, and private label offering are the primary catalysts, facilitating in meeting customer-oriented demand as well as improving in-store shopping experience. In an attempt to increase sales, profitability and cash flows, the company has been taking steps such as integration of operations as well as developing e-commerce business and online order fulfillment centers.In another move, Hal Lawton has been appointed as president of Macy’s. Lawton who previously served as the senior vice president in eBay North America, will directly report to the company’s CEO Jeff Gennette. At Macy’s, Lawton will be handling merchandising, stores, operations, technology, along with consumer insights and analytics.Recently, this department store retailer announced the restructuring of merchandising operations that includes combining of merchandising, planning and private brands divisions into one segment. As part of the restructuring, it would incur one-time costs of approximately $20-$25 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. However, management anticipates saving about $30 million on an annual basis. Further, it expects saving about $5 million or approximately 1 cent a share in the final quarter.Analysts view this restructuring activity as an effort to streamline operations, make decision making process much simpler along with managing inventory and pricing more efficiently. Further, analysts believe that with Lawton on board, the company expects to take its omni-channel business to next level with better integration of technology with brick-and-mortar stores.Hurdles to CrossMacy’s dwindling top and bottom-line results remain the primary concern for investors and this has gravely hurt the stock's performance in the past two years.

2275,GPS,"Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Aug 18. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this sporting goods retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. While the company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last reported quarter, it has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hibbett Sports, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 20 cents, which compares unfavorably with the prior-year period earnings of 29 cents. . Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $190.9 million, down about 7.8% from the year-ago quarter.Hibbettforms part of the Retail- Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to dip 0.9% year over year, while revenues are projected to grow 4.1%.Factors at PlayHibbett recently revealed soft preliminary comparable store sales (comps) data for second-quarter fiscal 2018. The company stated that comps for the quarter could tumble as much as 10%, owing to extremely challenging sales trends. Further, the company indicated that the decline in sales and pressured margins, would lead to a loss of 19–22 cents per share in the quarter to be reported. While management concurrently announced the launch of its e-Commerce site, it was not enough to revive investors’ sentiment. Evidently, shares of Hibbett have plunged 27.9% since its dismal preliminary results that were released on Jul 24. In fact, Hibbett has an unimpressive sales surprise history, as the company has lagged the sales estimates in eight out of the past nine quarters.Together, the murky surprise history and preliminary outcome have caused Hibbett to crash a steep 60.2% so far this year, much wider than the industry’s drop of 9.9%. Well, these factors make us quite apprehensive about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hibbettis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hibbett has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at a loss of 20 cents. Further, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. The combination of Hibbett’s unfavorable Zacks Rank and Earnings ESP of 0.00% lowers surprise prediction.Here Are 3 Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Big Lots, Inc.

Westport Fuel Systems outperformed the industry it belongs to in the last three months.

These relations enable the company to utilize its collaborators’ production plants, supply chains, back office systems as well as distribution and sales networks, thereby helping in significant cost savings.Westport Fuel Systems regularly makes investments and acquisitions related to technologies and businesses that help in the commercialization of its products. The company also completed the merger agreement with Fuel Systems Solutions, Inc.

The company’s CWI joint venture has also been facing challenges due to an industry decline in truck volumes.

2277,GPS,"Fossil Group Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) reported narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, while sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Shares plummeted 21.9% in after-hours trading on Aug 8, as the watchmaker gave a bleaker outlook and slashed its earnings, sales and operating income guidance in response to weak results. Adding to the upheaval, the company’s Chief Financial Officer Dennis Secor also announced its resignation due to personal reasons.Adjusted loss of 23 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Loss Estimate of 28 cents. However, it was unfavorable from the last year’s earnings of 9 cents per share, largely due to decline in top line, lower gross margin and currency headwinds.Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fossil Group, Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailThis global consumer fashion accessories maker’s net sales of $596.8 million in the second quarter lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $619 million by 3.6%. We note that the company has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine out of the last 11 straight quarters, including the current one. Though connected watches helped in growing the company’s sales, overall net sales decreased 13% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a decline in the company's multi-brand licensed watch portfolio and challenging environment for the traditional watch category. The decline in sales was wider than the 8–11.5% decline expected by the management. Declines in leather and jewelry business as well as unfavorable currency also led to the decline. Category-wise, watches declined 9.3% in the quarter, while jewelry and leather business declined 22% and 25.3%, respectively. Notably the sales of leathers have persistently been weak as customer response to the assortment continues to put pressure on results. On the other hand, wearables represented roughly 9% of the total sales in the second quarter, a sequential improvement from the 7% in the first quarter.Excluding $8.3 million adverse impact from currency, sales declined 12% in the quarter. Region-wise, sales declined 16% in Americas, 7% in Europe, and 8% in Asia, on a constant currency basis.Of late, Fossil has been witnessing general weakness in the watches category. The company noticed that tech-enabled watches have been significantly affecting traditional watch sales. Moreover, the watch industry has become highly competitive and the company is facing competition from Apple and other technology companies. Though Fossil has been expanding into smartwatches and wearable devices, the efforts are yet to turnaround results.Global retail comps, including e-Commerce, dropped 11% year over year during the quarter with declines in all product categories and in all regions. Positive comps in Asia were more than offset by declines in Europe and the Americas.Despite margin improvement initiatives and higher mix of international sales, gross margin declined 180 basis points (bps) to 50.5% due to lower retail margins, higher promotional activity, primarily in the outlet stores and higher mix of lower-margin connected product and unfavorable currency.In the quarter, the Richardson, Texas-based company reported operating loss margin of 1.4%, compared with operating margin of 2.3% in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower sales and gross margin, currency headwinds, despite lower operating expenses.We note that Fossil has been delivering sluggish results for a long time now. If we analyse the last six months’ performance of the company, we note that Fossil’s shares have declined 48.3% as compared with the industry, which has declined around 21.0% in the said time frame. On the other hand, the broader Retail and Wholesale sector has gained 12.5% in the last six months. Notably, the industry is part of the bottom 37% of the Zacks Classified industries (166 out of the 265).Other Financial UpdateAt the end of the second quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $319.8 million and long-term debt of $613.6 million and shareholders’ equity of $654.8 million.OutlookFor 2017, Fossil expects net sales to decline in the range of 4.5–8.5%, more than the previous range of down 1.5–6.0%. The company also expects adjusted operating margin in the range of 2.0–3.5%, unfavorable than the previously anticipated adjusted operating margin range of 3.0–4.5%. Further, it projects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of 35 cents to $1.15 per share, as compared with previously expected band of 80 cents–$1.50. In fact, the company posted adjusted earnings of $1.80 in fiscal 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is currently pegged at 93 cents per share that is within the company’s guided range.For the third-quarter of fiscal 2017, Fossil expects loss of 26 cents to earnings of 7 cents per share and adjusted operating margin in a range of 1.2–2.0%. The company expects net sales to decline in the range of 8.0–14.0%.Fossil continues to expect a challenging retail environment and pressure on the traditional watch category to persist. Currency will also continue to remain a headwind in 2017. Nevertheless, as demand for technology in wrist wear is increasingly rising among consumers, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company expects to capitalize the demand for wearables through a significant number of new products expected to launch in September and continue through the holiday season. The company has also connected celebrities with the wearable brands to reintroduce customers to the Fossil brand. The company expects to increase its marketing spending by over 40% in fiscal 2017 on wearables in order to build awareness for the new functionality available in these fashion-first technology accessories. Furthermore, it is on track to double the SKU count to nearly 300 this year and will add five more brands including DKNY, Marc Jacobs, MICHELE, Relic and Tory Burch, joining the already nine brands in its wearables platform. In fact, the company remains confident that wearables have the ability to help mitigate the ongoing softness in the traditional watch category.Moving ahead, Fossil continues to focus on the New World Fossil restructuring program along with growth in the company’s core watch business and product expansion. This restructuring initiative is likely to create a better operating platform that will cater to its customers efficiently in a tough retail landscape. Owing to the efforts, the company expects to deliver roughly 40% of the program's overall $200 million profit improvement in 2017 results.The company is also making efforts to relocate its resources to drive growth. As a result, the company is looking for store closures to drive savings this year and will remain focused to exit underperforming locations, primarily through natural lease expirations. For fiscal 2017, the company expects to close nearly 50 stores in addition to the 50 stores closed last year.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the apparel industry include The Children’s Place, Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report), Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report). All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2278,GPS,"CA-based restaurant operator, DineEquity, Inc.

In fact, its earnings met/surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 1.68%.DineEquity, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  DineEquity, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | DineEquity, Inc QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsComps at the IHOP brand have not been encouraging over the last three reported quarters. Nevertheless, DineEquity’s focus on brand innovation as well as its menu improvement strategy and breakfast inspired food offered throughout the day is expected to bring back the trend of positive comps in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, remodeling efforts, increased focus on to-go sales, technological innovation and initiatives to improve guest satisfaction is likely to drive incremental traffic.Meanwhile, Applebee’s casual dining restaurants are facing stiff competition from fast-food and quick service restaurants. Resultantly, comps have been weak therein in the last few quarters, despite various efforts to reinvigorate the brand.Nonetheless, we believe, renewed steps taken to revitalize the brand via increased focus on food and culinary innovation, guest satisfaction and marketing are likely to somewhat improve comps. In addition, the company has begun stabilization work for its Applebee’s business and is working with close franchisee collaboration to improve the brand’s performance.Meanwhile, an increase in expenses related to sales initiatives may dent the quarter’s profits. Incremental investments in marketing programs and promotional activity to combat competition are also expected to weigh on margins. Also, the continuing choppy sales environment in the overall restaurant space might limit revenue growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for DineEquity this quarter.

Also, the company’s bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters by an average of 12.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is, whether Macy's will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter has declined by a penny to 44 cents in the last 30 days. This reflects a year-over-year decline of 18%.

On the contrary, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, of which they are part of, gained 3%. Currently, the sector is placed at bottom 13% of the Zacks classified sectors (14 out of 16).Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Macy's this quarter.

In addition, the company warned investors that its margins may continue to feel the pinch and expects gross margin to shrivel by 100 basis points in the second quarter.Furthermore, Macy’s dwindling top-line and bottom-line results remain the primary threat for investors.

2280,GPS,"The Buckle, Inc. (BKE  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected earnings for the second straight quarter in second-quarter fiscal 2017. This also marked its second earnings beat after four consecutive misses. Moreover, the company’s top line met estimates for the 12th straight quarter.However, shares of Buckle dropped 0.7% following the earnings release as its dismal comparable store sales (comps) trend continued in the quarter. The company’s comps have been strained for quite some time now with the advent of digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online. This has considerably hit store and mall traffic trends across the United States.Moreover, the stock has plunged nearly 31.9% in the last six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 26.9%. Currently, the industry is placed at the bottom 39% of the Zacks classified industries (157 out of 256). On the contrary, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector gained 8.7%.Q2 HighlightsThe company reported earnings per share of 24 cents that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents but declined 25% from 32 cents delivered in the year-ago quarter.

Women’s merchandise contributed 49.5% to total sales, while the Men’s business input was pegged at 50.5%.Combined accessory sales fell nearly 8.5%, while footwear sales inched up 1%. These two categories contributed roughly 10.5% and 6.5%, respectively, to second-quarter net sales.Comps decreased 7.7% from the prior-year quarter. Moreover, online sales (not included in comparable-store sales) declined 4.5% year over year to $19.5 million.We observed that Buckle’s net sales decreased 9%, 5.9%, 8.8%, in July, June and May, respectively. Meanwhile, comparable sales declined a respective 8.4%, 5.8% and 9% in July, June and May.The company’s gross profit declined 7.3% to $74.1 million. However, gross margin expanded nearly 20 basis points (bps) to 37.9%. The upside was driven by higher merchandise margin and gains from higher cost of sales in fiscal 2016 related to the redemption of rewards under the sunset of old Primo card loyalty program. This was partly negated by higher occupancy, buying and distribution expenses due to lower comps.Operating income fell 27.8% to $17.4 million in the quarter. Also, operating margin came in at 8.9%, down from 11.4% recorded in the prior-year quarter.Other Financial AspectsBuckle ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $195.6 million, receivables of $14.7 million and total shareholders’ equity of $437.1 million.Moreover, the company had accounts payable of $39.9 million.

2281,GPS,"The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) gained 5.5% in yesterday’s after-market trading session, as the company raised its fiscal 2017 earnings outlook, following the better-than-expected second quarter results. While the quarter marked the second consecutive positive earnings surprise, it was Gap’s fifth straight quarter of sales beat. Comparable store sales (comps) also continued to witness strength for the third time in a row, mainly driven by sturdy performance of Old Navy. The company’s focus on enhancing product quality and quick response to the changing consumer trends also helped the results.However, foreign currency continued to play foul, resulting in the year-over-year decline in both the top and bottom lines. Nevertheless, yesterday’s upside drove this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock’s last three months’ performance to a solid 7.9%, which shows a marked improvement in comparison to the industry’s 9.4% decline.Q2 Highlights     Gap’s adjusted earnings of 58 cents a share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents, though it slid 3.3% from 60 cents earned in the year-ago period. Currency dented earnings per share growth to the tune of about 3 percentage points. On a GAAP basis, earnings came in at 68 cents, compared with 31 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteNet sales dipped 1.4% to $3,799 million, with foreign currency translations bearing an adverse impact of $37 million. Also, international store closures impacted net sales. However, the top-line fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,765 million. Further, comps climbed 1%, against a 2% decline recorded in the year-ago period.Comps continued to gain from robust Old Navy performance, which was fueled by improved traffic. This was partly offset by persistent softness across Banana Republic. As for the Gap brand, though comps dipped year over year, it improved sequentially thanks to better products. Looking at numbers, Old Nay comps grew 5%, whereas Gap and Banana Republic suffered 1% and 5%, respectively.MarginsGross profit rose 2.9% to $1,479 million, with the gross margin expanding 160 basis points (bps) to 38.9%. Adjusted gross margin grew 120 bps, attributable to a 110 bps increase in merchandise margins and 10 bps rent and occupancy expenses leverage.Operating income surged 61.6% to $451 million, while operating margin expanded about 470 bps to 11.9%. However, the adjusted operating margin contracted 90 bps to 10.2%, owing to higher adjusted operating expenses. These expenses stemmed from greater payroll costs, along with investments in digital and customer service initiatives.FinancialsGap ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,609 million, long-term debt of $1,248 million, and total shareholders’ equity of $2,945 million.During the first half, the company generated cash flow from operations of $486 million and incurred capital expenditures of $275 million. The company had free cash flow of $270 million on a year-to-date basis.For fiscal 2017, management projects capital expenditure of approximately $625 million, excluding the planned $200 million spending associated with reconstructing the Fishkill distribution center.Coming to Gap’s shareholder-friendly moves for the second quarter, the company paid dividend of 23 cents per share and bought back 4.5 million shares for $100 million. Year to date, the company payed $182 million as dividend. Additionally, on Aug 10, the company declared third-quarter dividend of 23 cents per share. Looking ahead, the company plans to make buybacks worth roughly $100 million in the third quarter.Store UpdatesIn the quarter under review, Gap introduced 22 stores, while shuttering 32 stores. Of the stores opened, 15 were company-operated and 7 were franchise. Similarly, the stores closed included 22 company-operated and 10 franchise stores. Thus, the company ended the quarter with 3,642 outlets in 47 countries, of which 3,179 were company-operated and 463 were franchise. Gap still anticipates store count for fiscal 2017 to be flat with fiscal 2016 levels.OutlookManagement remains impressed with its long-term growth endeavors, which mainly revolves around improving customer experience and accelerating responsiveness to their evolving demands. In this regard, Gap remains focused on enhancing product categories and boosting its web and mobile offerings. Encouraged by the progress in these initiatives and a solid first-half performance, the company raised its earnings per share projection for fiscal 2017, while retaining its sales and comps view.The company now envisions adjusted earnings for the fiscal year in the range of $2.02-$2.10 per share, compared with the previous range of $1.95-$2.05. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.00, which is likely to witness an upward revision following the upbeat outlook. Comps growth is still anticipated to range from flat to marginal improvement. Net sales, are expected to be little lower than this range, owing to the effect from currency woes and fiscal 2016 global store closures.For the third quarter, management stated that it expects SG&A expenses to increase at a higher rate than the first half. This mainly stems from increased product, marketing and digital investments for the significant back-to-school selling season.Looking for More?

2282,GPS,"Fossil Group Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) has been disappointing investors of late due to the multiple headwinds plaguing the broader retail industry as well as continued weakness in traditional watches. If we analyze the last six months’ performance of the company, we note that Fossil’s shares have slumped 61.7% as compared with the industry’s 23.5% decline.On the other hand, the broader Retail and Wholesale sector has gained 9.7% in the last six months. Notably, the industry is part of the top 45% of the Zacks Classified industries (118 out of the 265).Let’s take a look at the factors that is taking the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company downhill.Weak Quarterly Performance, Estimates Going DownAnalysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock over the last 7 days with estimates moving south. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is pegged at 73 cents, down from 93 cents per share in the said time frame. Similarly for 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate declined from $1.11 per share to 85 cents, over the same time frame.Fossil recently reported narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter 2017 results, while sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both losses and revenues were unfavorable from the year-over-year due to decline in traditional watches sales, sluggish leather and jewelry business as well as unfavorable currency. Further, this global consumer fashion accessories maker gave a bleaker outlook. Notably, the company’s sales have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine out of the last 11 straight quarters.Soft Watch Sales and Sluggish Leather BusinessFossil has been witnessing soft sales in traditional watches since long time now, due to increased competition in the market. Rising demand for technology in watches have also dented the demand for traditional watches. Also, volatility in sales pattern is expected as consumer preferences evolve around the globe.Also, the success of the Michael Kors brand is overshadowing other brands’ performance. Moreover, the announcement of Burberry exiting the watch business in Jan 2016 has also hurt the company’s business, as the brand will not renew its license agreement with Fossil upon its expiration at the end of 2017. The company continues to expect weakness in this category in the near term.Further, sales of leathers have persistently been weak as customer response to the assortment continues to put pressure on results. Decline in traditional watches and weak leather business also hurt sales in the Americas, Europe and Asia regions during the first half of 2017.Pressurized MarginsFossil has been witnessing lower margins in the retail channel, primarily due to increased promotions to drive sales in the outlets and online as well as higher mix of connected products, which currently deliver lower margins. The company expects the trend to continue throughout the balance of the year.Decelerating Growth in Key International MarketsFossil is facing economic challenges in many of the key markets. In the first half of fiscal 2017, Americas, Europe and Asia declined due to decline in traditional watches and leathers business, primarily offset by connected watches. Modest growth in Spain was offset by declines in the UK and Middle East with both the wholesale and retail channels decreasing across the region. Growth in India and China was offset by a decline in Japan and Australia.Other HeadwindsFossil remains exposed to challenges relating to the rapid changing consumer shopping behaviors as well as unfavorable foreign currency translations for its products sourced internationally. Going forward, currency rate fluctuations are expected to hinder the company’s sales and overall profitability. Fossil also remains susceptible to other economic challenges in many of its key markets. The company also faces the risk of import restrictions such as antidumping or countervailing duties, tariffs or other restrictions, as most of its products are manufactured overseas.  Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fossil Group, Inc. QuoteBottom LineThough Fossil has been delivering sluggish results for a long time now, due to its factors affecting the broader retail industry, as well as continued weakness in traditional watches, we remain positive on the stock owing to its expansion in the wearable space. Keeping in mind the rising demand for technology in wrist wear, the company has planned to roll out a significant number of new wearable products in the coming months.The company is also spending on marketing to build awareness for the new functionality available in these fashion-first technology accessories. In fact, the company remains confident that wearables have the ability to help mitigate the ongoing softness in the traditional watch category. However, whether these ongoing initiatives will be able to spark a turnaround in the company’s performance is a wait-and-watch story.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the same space may consider some better-ranked stocks like J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report). While J.C. Penney sports a Zacks Rank #1, Canada Goose and Gap carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.While J.C. Penney has an expected long-term earnings growth of 16.0%, Canada Goose and Gap have an expected earnings growth of 47.0% and 8.0%, respectively, for the next three to five years.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2283,GPS,"Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) posted solid second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates. While the company delivered positive earnings surprise for the fifth straight quarter, sales beat estimates after three consecutive misses.This led to shares of this leading fashion specialty retailer jump nearly 2.8% in the after-hours trading session. Further, we note that Nordstrom has gained 8.9% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s fall of 13.1%.Nordstrom’s quarterly adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share came substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. Further, bottom-line results also matched the company’s expectations.Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Nordstrom, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteRevenueTotal revenue advanced 3.9% to $3,793 million and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,732.1 million.The company’s net Retail sales increased 3.5% to $3,717 million, while Credit Card revenues rose 28.8% to $76 million. Total company comps rose 1.7% driven by comps growth at both full-line and Rack stores.Retail sales gained from relatively stronger performance at Nordstrom’s Anniversary sale, which happens to be its largest event for the year. Further, smooth execution of the company’s customer strategy, along with disciplined inventory and expense management, aided results.Moreover, the company’s fiscal second-quarter results reflected significant progress on its digital strategy. Notably, it delivered online sales growth of 20% at Nordstrom.com and a 27% increase at Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook.Net sales at Nordstrom full-line stores (including the U.S. and Canada full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club) rose 2.4%, with comps growth of 1.4%. The top-performing region during the quarter was East, while the best-performing categories were Women's Apparel and Beauty.Coming to Nordstrom Rack (that includes Nordstrom Rack stores and nordstromrack.com/HauteLook) net sales advanced 9.8%, while comps grew 3.1% on the back of growth in the Eastern region.Operational UpdateNordstrom's Retail gross profit margin contracted 25 basis points (bps) to 34.1%, mainly on account of increased occupancy expenses linked to new store expansion for Nordstrom Rack and in Canada, as well as higher loyalty expenses during the Anniversary Sale. This was partly mitigated by superior merchandise margins driven by more full-price selling.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, as a percentage of sales, rose 46 bps to 30.3%, driven by planned technology and supply chain expenses related to the company's growth efforts.Store UpdateIn the fiscal second-quarter, the company opened one new Nordstrom Rack store at Vintage Oaks Shopping Center in Novato, CA. Year to date, the company inaugurated a total of six new Rack stores while it closed one full-line store.As of Aug 11, 2017, Nordstrom operated 354 stores in 40 states, including 122 full-line stores in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico; 221 Rack outlets, two Jeffrey boutiques and two clearance stores.FinancialsNordstrom ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $919 million, long-term debt net of current liabilities of $2,729 million and total shareholders’ equity of $785 million.In first-half fiscal 2017, Nordstrom generated $574 million in cash from operating activities and free cash flow of $115 million. Capital expenditures during the first six months of fiscal 2017 were $341 million.GuidanceFollowing second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, the company updated its previously stated guidance for fiscal 2017. It now anticipates net sales growth of nearly 4% for fiscal 2017, which is at the high-end of its previous guidance of nearly 3–4% growth. However, it reiterated its view of nearly flat comps for the fiscal.Further, the company raised the lower-end of its previously stated Retail EBIT guidance. It now expects Retail EBIT in the range of $790–$840 million, compared with $780–$840 million anticipated earlier. This reflects higher increased occupancy expenses linked to new stores (Nordstrom Rack, Canada and Manhattan flagship men's store), alongside increased supply chain and technology costs. Meanwhile, Credit EBIT is now estimated to be about $145 million, versus the earlier forecast of about $140 million.Based on the above iterations, the company now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of $2.85–$3.00, compared with $2.75–$3.00 projected earlier. The company’s guidance includes the impact of the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2017, which is likely to add about $200 million to net sales and 2–3 cents to earnings per share.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksNordstrom currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the retail sector include Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report), The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc.

2284,GPS,"Popular apparel and accessories retailer, American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) is benefiting from solid strategies like enhancing product assortments; managing inventories efficiently and boosting e-commerce business. These efforts helped the company make a comeback in second-quarter fiscal 2017, alongside retaining its sturdy comparable store sales (comps) trends.However, in the process of keeping pace with the changing consumer environment and battling stiff industry competition, the company is witnessing strained margins. So, let’s see if American Eagle’s growth drivers will be enough to offset these hurdles, and help the company keep its growth story intact.American Eagle’s Growth Endeavors On TrackGiven Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing control and consumers’ rapid shift to online shopping, retailers are firing on all cylinders to tap sales. Many apparel companies like Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) have resorted to the omni-channel strategy. Likewise, American Eagle too remains focused on strengthening its product assortments by adding more compelling brands, managing inventory levels diligently and improving e-commerce business.Moreover, it remains committed toward enhancing store sales by rationalizing its brick and mortar store fleet that includes closing underperforming stores and expanding the profitable ones. In sync, the company recently announced plans to close about 25-40 stores in fiscal 2017. Additionally, it targets opening 10 outlets (including five AE and Aerie stores, each) across the United States, Canada and Mexico through the rest fiscal 2017, as well as 32 international licensed stores.Further, it remains on track to launch the revamped loyalty program that is likely to convert more than 15 million current metrics and attract new customers with a seamless overall experience. This completely digital program will be fully integrated across shopping channels, enhancing customers’ shopping experience. Also, American Eagle has been improving its website as well as mobile app to develop its omni-channel platform. Notably, these endeavors helped American Eagle’s e-commerce sales to contribute about 23% to total revenues in second-quarter fiscal 2017.Factors That Drove Q2 PerformanceWhile the quarter marked second straight quarter of sales beat, earnings topped estimates after a miss in the last quarter. The company also posted 10th straight quarter of positive comparable store sales (comps) backed by strong online sales at both the brands driven by efficient use of omni-channel capabilities to enhance customer experience. Results also gained from strength in the aerie brand, which posted 14th straight quarter of double-digit comps growth. Moreover, the company is optimistic about the second half of fiscal 2017, particularly the fall season.Strained Margins: A Major ConcernWhile retailers remain committed toward strategies like optimizing store fleet and boosting e-commerce sales, consumers’ evolving preferences and mounting industry competition have forced them to undertake intense promotions to clear inventory. American Eagle is not safe from this trend. Though American Eagle’s second-quarter fiscal 2017 marked a comeback, margins continued to be under pressure due to increased promotional activities to counter sluggish mall traffic.The company’s adjusted gross margin contracted 240 basis points (bps) in the second quarter, while operating margin shriveled 230 bps. The downturn was mainly accountable to greater promotional activity, alongside a rise in buying, occupancy and warehousing costs, and higher SG&A expenses. Going forward, the company expects the soft margin trends to continue and hurt results in the fiscal third quarter, as evident from its recent guidance. For the fiscal third quarter, the company projects soft merchandise margins due to intense promotional activities. Moreover, it anticipates SG&A expenses to increase in low-single digits.So, What’s in Store for American Eagle?Nevetheless, American Eagle is focused on undertaking initiatives to reduce costs through supply chain efficiencies and its updated product allocation system. We believe that all aforementioned initiatives should help the company combat the hurdles and drive profitability.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2285,GPS,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to increase the minimum wages of its team members to $11 an hour, effective from October. The company also stated that the minimum hourly wages for all team members will be raised to $15 by the end of 2020. The move will benefit employees with higher wages, right before the holiday season. Encouragingly, the raised wages will also benefit around 100,000 temporary employees hired during the holiday season.Continued Investment in Workforce The labor market conditions in the United States have been steadily improving with declining unemployment rates and frequent wage hikes by firms across different industries.Target previously raised its minimum hourly wages in 2016 to $10 from $9 in 2015, following suit of other giant retailers who raised their pay to attract workers amid a highly competitive market scenario. The current wage hike by Target is expected to force other retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (WMT  -  Free Report), one of the largest domestic employers, Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) and Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) to raise their minimum pay in order to remain competitive, especially during the ongoing holiday season hiring.  Target’s wage hike also exceeds the minimum federal wage rate of $7.25.The increase in minimum wages is in line with Target’s strategic store-growth policies, that focuses on retaining efficient employees and attract more workers as the company progresses with its store remodeling and expansion initiatives. Moreover, Target has always remained committed toward investing in its workforce. In addition to a healthy pay, the company also provides a number of other benefits such as discounts on select merchandise at Target stores, health and wellness services as well as financial resources for eligible members.Reiterates Guidance Despite a wage hike, which will lead to higher expenses, Target has reiterated its upcoming third quarter and full-year guidance. This indicates that the current hike will not affect the company’s operating results.Target continues to remain consistent with its sales growth expectation, to be in the range of flat to plus or minus 1%. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter are also continued to be expected in the range of 75 cents to 95 cents per share, while full year earnings are anticipated in the range of $4.34 to $4.54.Though the wage hike will raise the expense burden on the retailer, we believe the move will keep workers content and also help improve customer service. This will ultimately encourage shoppers to spend more.Share Price Performance The company’s continued investment toward improving store formats, customer-friendly initiatives and enhancing online shopping facilities are seen to bode well with investors.

2286,GPS,"A recent report from Deloitte shows that retail holiday sales are expected to rise 4 - 4.5% compared to last year’s shopping season. Total holiday sales (seasonally adjusted and excluding autos and gas) are expected to reach $1.04 to $1.05 trillion in the November – January timeframe. This compares to retail sales of $1 trillion in the November 2016 – January 2017 timeframe (data as per the U.S. Commerce Department).Meanwhile, e-commerce sales are expected to increase 18 - 21% in 2017 and reach $111 - $114 billion during this holiday season. This compares to e-commerce sales (seasonally adjusted and excluding autos, gas, food services and parts dealers) of $93.8 billion between November 2016 and January 2017.Factors that will Drive the IncreaseThe retail sector has been showing signs of stabilizing with the industry performing better than the overall market year to date.With the holiday season round the corner, retailers are gearing up to attract customers through promotions, early-store openings, heavy discounts, as well as free shipping on online purchases. Retailers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) are hiring seasonal associates for the upcoming Christmas and holiday season.As per Deloitte’s senior U.S. economist, one of the factors that will drive consumer spending is the strong growth in personal income that is expected this year – disposable personal income, which grew 2% over the year to the holiday period in 2016, is expected to grow to 3.8-4.2% this season. Other driving factors include high levels of consumer confidence, a strong labor market and a low level of personal savings.How to Pick the Right StocksWhile things are looking up for the retail sector, there are still certain factors that could lead to lower-than-expected sales. These include the impact of the recent hurricanes which could affect spending as well as a tendency to save more that would lead to lower spending. Moreover, spending on essential services like healthcare could also curtail retail spending.Given this scenario, it makes sense to zero in on stocks which carry a strong Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).We have picked four stocks from the Zacks Apparel and Shoes industry which enjoys a good Zacks Industry Rank (top 36% out of 256 industries).Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

2287,GPS,"The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) looks appeasing on the back of its new growth strategy, solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 has moved up by a penny in the last seven days and is pegged at $2.07.Markedly, Gap’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average of 9.3%.Bottom LineThough Gap’s significant international presence exposes it to adverse currency fluctuations that are expected to persist in fiscal 2017, we believe that the company’s initiatives should not only boost performance but also help in countering these headwinds, going forward.3 Retail Stocks Hogging the LimelightSome other top-ranked stocks in the same industry include Zumiez Inc. , Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

2288,GPS,"Office Depot, Inc. (ODP  -  Free Report), which is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 9, has seen shares jump 16.2% in the past three months. The stock has comfortably outperformed the industry that declined 9.6% and the broader Retail-Wholesale sector that gained 2.8%. In fact in the past five days, the stock has climbed roughly 1.7%. This gives us a fair idea that the stock is favorably placed among the list of companies that defines the industry.Per the Earnings Preview report, Retail-Wholesale sector is likely to witness earnings decline of 1.6% but revenue increase of 4% this reporting cycle. Let’s take a closer look as to how Office Depot is expected to contribute to the sector’s performance.What to Expect from Office Depot?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this supplier of a range of office products and services will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company’s past performance reveals that it had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding three quarters.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 9 cents compared with 3 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,460 million, down about 23.6% from the prior-year quarter.Office Depot, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Office Depot, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Office Depot, Inc. QuoteFactors at Play Office Depot is closing underperforming stores, reducing exposure to higher dollar-value inventory items, shuttering non-critical distribution facilities, concentrating on eCommerce platforms as well as focusing on providing innovative products and services. Moreover, the company is increasing penetration into adjacent categories. The company now intends to focus solely on core North American market.With respect to the cost containment effort, Office Depot is employing a more efficient customer coverage model, focusing on lowering indirect procurement costs along with general and administrative expenditures. Further, it is gaining from its U.S. retail store optimization plan. Management expects these endeavors to result in annual benefits of over $250 million by the end of 2018.Analysts pointed out that demand for office products (paper-based) has been decreasing due to technological advancements. Smartphones, tablets and laptops are fast emerging as viable substitutes for paper-based office supplies. Further, stiff competition from online retailers has been playing spoilsport for Office Depot.Office Depot continues to battle a dismal top-line that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 11th consecutive quarter, when it reported first-quarter 2017 results. Management expects total sales to be lower in 2017 in comparison with 2016, due to the store closures, tough market conditions and losses of contract customers in the prior year. However, management anticipates the rate of decline to decelerate throughout 2017 taking into consideration higher customer retention and improvement in the contract channel sales pipeline, along with the implementation of new customer wins.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Office Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Office Depot has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 9 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Gap, Inc.

2289,GPS,"Noodles & Company (NDLS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Aug 10, after market close.Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. However, the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise is a negative 10.12%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Noodles & Company Price and EPS Surprise Noodles & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Noodles & Company QuoteFactors Likely to Influence Q2 ResultsVarious sales building initiatives undertaken by the company such as streamlining of menu and its innovation, introduction of new cooking procedures, effective marketing strategy, increased focus on the off-premise business along with investments in technology-driven initiatives like digital ordering are expected to boost the quarter’s results. Moreover, efforts to simplify operations are likely to improve execution and result in increased guest satisfaction and labor productivity.In fact, the return of its popular item – Pasta Fresca – in May 2017 might also boost the quarter’s sales.Last quarter, Noodles & Company completed the closure of all of its underperforming restaurants that had been consistently hampering its human and financial capital. Thus, second quarter margins are likely to gain from this closure.However, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurants space might continue to hurt traffic and thereby comps in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, per its first-quarter conference call, management anticipates low-to-mid single-digit negative company-owned comparable restaurant sales for the second quarter.Meanwhile, this fast-casual restaurateur’s margins are further expected to be under pressure due to higher costs as well as expenses related to the implementation of strategic initiatives.Notably, the company recently implemented a revised pricing structure, which incorporates about 2% of price increase, and aids in better understanding of the menu. Therefore, it now remains to be seen what impact this step has on traffic and sales in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Noodles & Company this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Noodles & Company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 2 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Noodles & Company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the broader Retail-Wholesale sector that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

2290,GPS,"The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this home improvement retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record of over four years now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise   Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $2.21, reflecting year-over-year growth of over 12%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $27.8 billion, up about 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayHome Depot’s splendid past performance reflects its focus on solid strategic initiatives. The company remains keen on building its interconnected capabilities, in response to the evolving retail environment – where digital and physical stores go hand in hand. In this direction, the company has made great strides in the past, by redesigning its website with enhanced features. Further, Home Depot’s interconnected strategy goes beyond the dot.com as it continues to invest in fulfillment options to meet customers demand through launches like customer order management system (COM) and the Buy Online Deliver From Store (BODFS) capability. Well, Home Depot continues to reap benefits from these initiatives, as evident from online sales growth of nearly 23% in first-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, we believe that these efforts are likely to drive the company’s top and bottom lines in future. Apart from this, Home Depot is also gaining from housing market recovery and favorable customer demand.All these factors, which had encouraged management to raise its earnings view for fiscal 2017, also usher in confidence about the company’s upcoming release. However, intense competition remains a threat. Also, significant exposure to international markets makes Home Depot vulnerable to currency headwinds. Nonetheless, we note that shares of Home Depot have gained about 2.5% over the last six trading sessions, which clearly underscores investors’ positive sentiment in the company. Moreover, Home Depot’s shares have jumped 14.3% so far this year outperforming the industry’s 11.3% growth. Well, it looks like Home Depot is most likely to maintain its robust trend this time too.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Home Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

2291,GPS,"Mall-based specialty retailer, Zumiez Inc.  has been a top performer in the recent months, despite tough retail environment. Most of the credit for this turnaround goes to the company’s investments in omni-channel and stringent cost controls. This has in turn aided in delivering robust earnings and sales surprise history, as well as solid comparable store sales (comps) in recent quarters.The challenging trends in the retail industry are characterized by sluggish mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and macroeconomic uncertainty.Stock Surge Depicts MomentumEvidently, the company has significantly outperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The stock has witnessed a substantial growth of 39.9%, while the industry dipped 4.9%. Further, the stock has surged a whopping 30.6% following robust second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 7.Further, we believe the company is poised to sustain this momentum given the positive commentary on future results, supported by a long-term EPS growth rate of 15%.Robust Earnings & Sales HistoryZumiez continued positive surprise trend in the recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 as both top and bottom lines beat estimates. With this, the company delivered positive earnings surprise for the eighth straight quarter, while sales topped estimates in six of the last eight quarters. The company’s average positive surprise in trailing four quarters is pegged at 27.1%.The outperformance in the quarter was driven by solid comps growth alongside investments in omni-channel capabilities and stringent cost controls.Zumiez Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Zumiez Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zumiez Inc. QuoteComps Growth Trend Backs Positive Outlook and Boosts EstimatesThe company reported positive comps for both the fiscal second quarter and August, marking fourth straight quarter and sixth consecutive month of comps growth. Further, the company notes that the positive comps momentum continued in September, with quarter-to-date comps through Labor Day increasing 8.3% and September month-to-date comps through Labor Day growing 11.4%.Backed by this trend, Zumiez issued an encouraging outlook for third-quarter fiscal 2017. The company expects net sales in the $236-$241 million range, with comps growth of 4-6%. It also projects earnings of 43-48 cents per share. Moreover, the company provided an optimistic view for fiscal 2017 despite a challenging retail environment. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 and $1.12 for fiscal 2017 and 2018 rose 10.8% and 8.7%, respectively, in the last 30 days.Strategic Initiatives to Drive GrowthAdditionally, Zumiez is gaining from focus on providing differentiated assortments and by providing a great shopping experience to customers. It remains keen on connecting with core customers more frequently and on a more personalized level. This is strengthening its position in the industry by significant market share gains. Moreover, the company is boosting competitive advantage by investments in logistics, planning and allocation along with omni-channel capabilities, which poises it for growth both in the near and long term.Getting into further details of these initiatives, the company is on track with the roll out of new customer engagement strategies across stores in the United States. It is also focused on finding new and unique brands across all departments. In this connection, the company plans to launch more than 100 new brands in its stores. This will help bring freshness in its merchandise that customers are looking for.Further, the company is striving to expand e-commerce and omni-channel platforms to provide consumers with the facility of quick and easy access to its products and brands. In this regard, Zumiez has considerably improved customers’ experience, by integrating its physical and digital networks. This allows customers to access inventories through all channels, alongside availing facilities like buy online, pick up in store, reserve online and pay in store. We believe these strategies place the company well for growth.Streamlining Stores for Balanced GrowthAt the same time, Zumiez keeps up with the strategy of optimizing store base through expansion in the underpenetrated markets and by either repositioning or closing underperforming stores through constant evaluation, aimed at maximizing long-term productivity. Though the company has slowed down the rate of domestic store growth, it continues to see opportunities for international expansion. In fiscal 2017, it intends to introduce 18 new stores, including three in Canada, four in Europe and two in Australia.ConclusionThough the tough retail environment and impact from foreign currency will remain hurdles for the company, its strategic actions position it well for sustained growth in the long term.

2292,GPS,"With the holiday season approaching, retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year and it goes without saying that competition will be tough, be at brick-and-mortar stores or online. Its a foregone conclusion that retail bellwethers will leave no stone unturned to make the most of the season that accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. They will sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, and free shipping on online purchases.However, the recent soft retail sales data for the month of August have somewhat subdued the fervor of retailers. Adding to the woes, is the recent cut in 2017 retail sales forecast by the National Retail Federation. Per the retail trade association, retail sales — excluding autos, gas and restaurant — are expected to jump in the band of 3.2-3.8% down from 3.7-4.2% projected previously.Market experts asserted that while recent hurricanes resulted in short-term derailment in the economic activity, a lift in the later part of the year remains on the cards. However, they cautioned that a surge in gasoline prices will pinch the pockets of consumers who make bulk purchases during the holiday season. Nevertheless, improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer confidence indicate sturdy sales during this shopping season.According to Deloitte, sales during the holiday season are likely to go up as much as 4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%. The data unveiled by Kantar suggests that sales during the fourth-quarter holiday period is expected to jump 3.7%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Retailers Taking E-RouteThe retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a major role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This transition in shopping pattern is compelling retailers to rapidly adapt to the changes in the ecosystem. Retailers now have no option left but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario or get eliminated. They are now focusing more on enhancing omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has been in the spotlight for the last few years, as changing customer patterns made the retail industry more dependent on e-commerce.Amazon’s recent takeover of Whole Foods Market sent shivers down major grocery retailers. Analysts are looking at this acquisition as an amalgamation between online marketplace and physical stores. The deal gave Amazon an easy access to roughly 400 plus stores and a foothold in the grocery business. The e-commerce giant acquired online retail platform Souq.com to tap the Middle East market and entered the Chinese market with the buyout of Joyo.com, an online retailer of music, books, videos and DVDs. Further, NIKE Inc.’s (NKE  -  Free Report) plans to sell directly through Amazon raised concerns for other sporting goods retailers. Sears Holdings entered into an accord to sell Kenmore-branded appliances on Amazon’s platform.Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is also making huge investments in e-commerce initiatives. The company’s acquisitions of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com fall in line with its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company partnered with Alphabet’s Google to enable shopping through Google Express using voice-activated service. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) has been also focusing on developing its online business. Recently, it waged war against other retail big-wigs by aggressively cutting prices on a range of items.Hiring on Track to Meet the Holiday RushRetailers such as Macy’s, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Target, The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) have announced hiring plans for the upcoming holiday season as they expect higher store traffic based on renewed consumer confidence.Per media reports, Target intends to employ 100,000 associates, while Macy's will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers to handle the rush. Meanwhile, Gap has begun inviting applications for seasonal associate positions at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada. Gap’s hiring events will be organized at all concerned stores on Sep 23, 2017. 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. (FLWS  -  Free Report) plans to hire about 8,000 associates nationwide for the season.Be Hawk-Eyed on the Extra MilesThe holiday season is nothing less than a battlefield for the retailers fighting hard to win over consumers. Companies will go the extra mile — offering discounts or indulging in promotional activities — to trap the bargain hunters. But we wonder whether these will come at the price of margins, not to say the impact on the bottom line.We believe that with the advent of the holiday season, the retail sector will hog all the attention. So, how about betting your bucks on lucrative options? Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's, Nike and Gap all carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2293,GPS,"With technology having advanced in leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to the various mobile apps and dot.com businesses, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Talking of e-Commerce, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is undoubtedly the first name to pop-up on anyone’s mind.Obviously, consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace and Amazon’s growing dominance has hit store traffic hard. This has shaken most retailers and compelled them to adopt omni-channel strategies, which has become the need of the hour. Before getting into how retailers are coping up with the evolving consumer preferences and mounting competition from the e-Commerce king, let’s take a glance at the U.S. Retail e-Commerce Sales data.e-Commerce Sales Data — a Major Indicator of Consumers’ Changing PreferencesPer the U.S. Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce, the estimate for second-quarter 2017 U.S. retail e-Commerce sales rose 4.8% sequentially, to $111.5 billion. On a year-over-year basis, this estimate surged 16.2%. Further, the Bureau stated that e-Commerce sales constituted about 8.9% of the total retail sales in the second quarter, marking a 40 basis points and 90 bps improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis, respectively. Notably, these estimates included adjustments related to seasonal variations.Amazon Trying to Gain Lion’s ShareAmazon’s popularity is attributable to its solid technological expertise, which enables it to offer consumers an unmatched level of convenience. Its user-friendly app and website, impressive product assortment, constant innovations, and seamless payment and checkout system have helped it to become consumers’ favorite shopping destination.Further, this e-Commerce giant’s success story is highlighted by its AmazonFresh Pickup service, and its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). While the former allows users to order groceries online, the latter is a provider of technological infrastructure. This biggie is also known for the online and offline features added to its bookstores.Driven by these efforts, the company recorded 25% growth in net sales, which came in at roughly $38 billion in the second quarter of 2017. When most retailers are struggling to boost their top lines, Amazon’s growth is a clear indication of how the company trying to capture the lion’s share.Moreover, the company’s takeover of Whole Foods Market Inc. sent shivers down major grocery retailers. Also, NIKE Inc.’s (NKE  -  Free Report) plans to sell directly through Amazon raised concerns for other sporting goods retailers like Foot Locker, Dicks Sporting Goods, Inc. and Hibbett Sports, among others. Clearly, these hurdles have had a dismal impact on the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector that currently occupies the bottom-most place among all 16 sectors.Can Walmart & Others Catch Up to Amazon?However, retailers are leaving no stone unturned and are following Amazon’s footsteps. The companies are also firing on all cylinders to change their operating methods.  To counter the intense competition and keep pace with the altering trends, various bellwethers are adopting omni-channel strategies to draw online traffic.To start with major supermarket chain Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), we note that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is making huge investments in e-Commerce initiatives. The company’s acquisitions of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com fall in line with its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Also, Wal-Mart partnered with Alphabet’s Google last month to enable shopping through Google Express using voice-activated service. Notably, Walmart’s e-Commerce sales soared roughly 60% in the last quarter, mainly backed by its solid online grocery business.Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is another department store retailer that is doing everything possible to stay afloat in the current scenario. Evidently, last week this Minneapolis-based company announced plans to slash prices of a number of products. Incidentally, this news came soon after Amazon decided to cut prices at its recently acquired Whole Foods business.Apart from this, Target has been focused on developing its online business, which helped it to witness comparable digital channel sales growth of 32% in second-quarter fiscal 2017, compared with 16% in the same period last year. Likewise, Macy’s Inc.’s (M  -  Free Report) digital sales witnessed double digit growth in the last quarter, thanks to its omni-channel measures. Both Target and Macy’s hold the same Zacks Rank as Walmart.While this was for department store behemoths, we also have major apparel/shoe and sportswear companies that are responding well to the online rage. As mentioned above, NIKE recently revealed plans to sell directly through Amazon, which is most likely to enhance its market. It looks like the swoosh brand followed athletic wear Under Armour that sells directly through its own, customized page on Amazon.Moving to popular apparel/shoe retailers, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO  -  Free Report), Abercrombie & Fitch and The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) are few among the many retailers resonating with the dot.com bandwagon. These retailers’ online sales contributed significantly to their top lines in the last quarter, underscoring their efforts to develop their omni-channel platform to reach customers in every possible way.While American Eagle and Abercrombie carry a Zacks Rank #3 each, Gap carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will the Efforts Bear Fruit?The aforementioned retailers are just a few examples from the list of those names battling Amazon’s rising dominance. These retailers and their growth strides have helped the sector surge 17.3% so far this year, surpassing the S&P 500 market’s 11.8% growth. Though the present scenario is far from being rosy for retailers, continued focus on boosting e-Commerce investments will definitely help them withstand industry challenges.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2295,GPS,"Shares of some of the world’s biggest retail companies—including Macy’s, Walmart, and Target—jumped on Tuesday, marking a rare day of positive trading for this struggling sector.Indeed, the retail space was up nearly across the board on Tuesday. Shares of the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) were up 2.44%, while the Direxion Daily Retail Bull 3x Shares ETF (RETL  -  Free Report) skyrocketed 7.41%.The Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), and PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) were all up marginally.Tuesday’s retail ETF gains can be attributed to gains from some retail giants, most of which have seen their shares dip in the last year amid a shifting shopping climate.Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s KSS all jumped over 2% on Tuesday. Nordstrom (JWN) rose 2.96%, and Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) climbed 3.72%. The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), up 4.01%, was one of Tuesday’s biggest retail movers.Also among the day’s top movers was Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), a department store chain which gained more than 7% on Tuesday after a report surfaced that suggested the stock appears to be heading for an “infinity squeeze” similar to Volkswagen’s now-legendary 2008 short squeeze (read more: Dillard's Stock Soars on Report of Imminent ""Infinity Squeeze"").Still, despite today’s upward movement, talk of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) apparent takeover of the entire retail world aren’t likely to stop just yet.It is true that the industry has been shaken and most likely altered forever by Jeff Bezos’ behemoth. The online retail giant dove headfirst into almost every sector imaginable, and has transformed retail into a more on-demand style world, where everything from books to snacks can be delivered to users in a few hours.But one retail player’s upward movement on Tuesday could be a sign of hope for the sector that many have all but written off. Barnes & Noble  posted a monster day, up over 15%, on the back of news that activist investors are set to push for a sale.At first glance that might seem like another sign that retail is struggling, but the firm is convinced that brick-and-mortar still has a place in the retail world. Barnes & Noble’s activist investors have faith that brick-and-mortar isn’t dead—it just needs to be revamped.And today’s retail movement might signal that some share this glimmer of hope.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017  From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

2296,GPS,"Its time again for the second-quarter reporting cycle to gain momentum. In fact, now that we are done with the earnings results from the early reporters and the late comers from the previous quarter, we will witness second-quarter earnings acquiring full impetus. So, let’s brace ourselves for the next round of earnings.Among all the sectors, our focus in the discussion here will be the Retail-Wholesale sector.  A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to bear the brunt of the current challenging retail environment due to sluggish mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and increased competition from online players. We believe the impact of the slowdown in traffic trends will clearly be reflected in the diminished sales and comparable store sales (comps) numbers in second-quarter 2017.Further, these retailers are heavily investing in eCommerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.The data released by the Commerce Department on Jul 14 revealed that retail sales declined for the second month in a row. U.S. retail and food services sales for Jun 2017 declined 0.2% sequentially, compared with a 0.1% decline in May. The decline can be attributed to soft sales at gasoline stations, clothing retailers and department stores. Further, consumers continued to spend lower at restaurants as well as on hobbies.Additionally, the data revealed that retail trade sales for June dipped 0.1% from May but increased about 3% from last year. While non-store retailers registered growth of 9.2% from last year, sales for the Sporting Goods, Hobby, Book, & Music Stores declined 8.9% year over year.However, U.S. retail and food services sales improved 2.8% form Jun 2016. Moreover, total sales for second-quarter 2017 (Apr 2017 through Jun 2017) reflected a 3.8% growth from the prior-year period. The overall increase in the estimate for the second quarter could be attributed to the growing online sales, which now forms a part of core sales of most retailers.Q2 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 Index so far, 30 S&P 500 members that together represent 9.3% of the Index’s total market capitalization have released second-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies were up 13.8%, on 6% revenue growth. Further, about 83.3% delivered both positive earnings and revenue surprises.While this represents only a small sample, we can ascertain that the second-quarter earnings season is surely off to a good start. More clarity on the results will be evident from the S&P members reporting earnings in the next few weeks. A look at the earnings calendar shows that we are only few days away from the reporting cycle fully taking off.Coming to expectations, total earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.6% year over year, with a 4.5% jump in revenues. For the retail sector, in particular, earnings in the second quarter are expected to inch up 0.1%, with 3.7% revenue growth.The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest Earnings Preview report published on Jul 15.That said, we bring to you five retail stocks that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.

2297,GPS,"The retail sector received a much-needed boost on July 13 as stocks logged their best single-day return of this year. SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) was up over 2.3% on the day while its year-to-date return is still in the red. With Thursday’s stellar returns, the fund is now down about 9.4% in the year-to-date frame (as of July 13, 2017).Credit Goes to Target Corp.Target Corp. (TGT) guides sales to grow for the first time in five quarters, backed by higher traffic and improving sales trends. Target raised its expectations for comparable store sales to a modest increment for the current quarter from the previous forecast of negative comps. Earnings are now projected above the high end of Target’s forecast of $0.95–$1.15 per share. TGT was up about 4.8% on July 13.The news acted as a cornerstone for the entire space. Hint of improvement in traffic to a brick-and-mortar retailer spurred hopes of a trend reversal in the overall retail space.Inside Brick-and Mortar’s Constant Pain The sector as a whole has so far been under pressure. After witnessing decent growth in January, U.S. retail sales recorded a decline in February, a moderation in March, a lukewarm improvement in April, and a slight drop in May (read: 5 ETFs & Stocks: Silver Lining in Soft May Retail Sales).Disappointing earnings results were noticed from several traditional brick-and-mortar operators lately while web-based shopping surged. As of now, online retail sales make up one tenth of total retail and about 5% of annual e-commerce revenue in the U.S. The space is developing fast with the increased usage of smartphones and other mobile internet devices. Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) is up over 33% so far this year.Notably, the online e-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) just saw a record third annual Prime Day. This was the biggest shopping day in the company’s history, surpassing Black Friday and Cyber Monday (read: Amazon Prime Day Hits Record: 5 Best ETF Deals).Other Retail Stock Winners Post Target-Induced BoostOn July 13, several retail stocks were on a tear. J. C. Penney Company (JCP  -  Free Report) (up 7.8%), Macy's (M  -  Free Report) (up 4.1%), The Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) (up 5.6%), American Eagle Outfitters Inc.

(DDS  -  Free Report) (up 6.3%), Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) (up 4.8%) are some of the winners.Why These ETFs to Play Investors should note that the Zacks Industry Rank for discount retailers is in top 38%. The Zacks Industry Rank for catalog shopping is in top 1%. Agreed, there are a lot of corners in the retail space that are in the bottom section, but if Target’s indication proves right for the whole space, investors can play the below-mentioned ETFs.XRT in FocusThis product tracks the S&P Retail Select Industry Index, holding about 100 securities in its basket with none accounting for more than 1.49% of assets.

2299,GPS,"On Wednesday, shares of apparel retailer Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) are popping, up nearly 7% in afternoon trading after the company, which operates the Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, and Athleta brands, announced a promising new growth strategy.Gap is planning on focusing on its two “growth brands”: discount juggernaut Old Navy and Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) rival Athleta. The company expects net sales of more than $10 billion and $1 billion, respectively, at each of the brands over the next few years, with these gains coming as a result of U.S. store expansion and mobile and e-commerce growth.“Over the past two years, we’ve made significant progress evolving how we operate – starting with getting great product into the hands of our customers, more consistently and faster than ever before,” said Art Peck, president and CEO.“With much of this foundation in place, we’re now shifting our focus to growth. We will leverage our iconic brands and significant scale to deliver growth by shifting to where our customers are shopping – online, value and active.”Additionally, Gap announced that it will open 270 Old Navy and Athleta stores, while simultaneously closing 200 underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores over the next three years.As Gap customers are likely aware, the retailer has steadily increased its online presence across all of its brands, and its online division is one of its most profitable, posting double-digit sales growth. Along with store expansion, Gap will launch a buy online, pick-up in store service, a new personalization engine that is powered by customer data, and “continued significant investment” in its omni-channel services.Gap hopes these new strategies will create about $500 million in expense savings over the next three years, and the company added that it plans to reinvest a portion of those savings in its growth goals.Currently, GPS is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, and the stock is up just about 2.3% year-to-date.If you’re a value investor, taking a look at Gap may be a good idea, especially now with this new growth strategy in place. Old Navy has always been a huge money maker for the company, and if Gap’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings are any indication, all of the retailer’s brands look to be on the upswing.Right now, Gap’s P/E sits at 11.60, falling slightly below the Retail-Apparel and Shoes industry's price-to-earnings of 12.19. Over the past five years, Gap’s valuation has cheapened significantly due to overall weakness in the retail industry, but also due to investor and consumer skepticism about the quality of Gap that spiked over that last two years or so. While GPS has stabilized somewhat in the past year, the stock still trades well below the S&P 500.If Gap can smartly leverage the popularity of Old Navy and Athleta, the company may just be on its way to reaching the icon status it once held before.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

2300,GPS,"Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report) focus on e-Commerce capabilities, innovative line of products and concentrated efforts on expanding brand assortments has been received well by investors, evident from the stock’s gain of 17.5% in the last six months. Moreover, the stock has also outperformed the industry which has witnessed a decline of 4.3%.However, in the past month the stock has lost momentum and witnessed a marginal decline of 2%. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystDeckers is targeting profitable markets, and remains focused on product innovations and store augmentation. Management is eyeing opportunities for store expansion, targeting underpenetrated markets, enhancing e-Commerce capabilities along with transitioning to a direct subsidiary model from a distributor model outside the United States. The company’s focus on expanding brand assortments, bringing more innovative line of products, targeting consumers through marketing and optimizing omni-channel distribution bode well.In keeping with the changing trends, Deckers has made substantial investments to strengthen online presence and improve shopping experience for customers. Further, it is focused on opening smaller concept omni-channel outlets and expanding programs such as Retail Inventory Online, Infinite UGG; Buy Online, Return In Store; and Click and Collect to enhance shopping experience.Moreover, in an effort to drive long-term growth, the company has taken strategic initiatives. Its store fleet optimization plan focuses on striking the right balance between digital and physical stores. Additionally, Deckers plans to close approximately 30 to 40 outlets over the next two years. By fiscal 2020, it anticipates a company-owned fleet of approximately 125 stores worldwide.Management expects cost savings of about $150 million on the back of improvement in cost of goods sold and SG&A savings, which includes consolidation of retail outlets and process improvement efficiencies. This will help realize $100 million operating profit improvement by fiscal 2020.ConcernsFollowing first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Deckers has kept fiscal 2018 guidance intact but provided a soft second-quarter outlook. Management expects net sales to decline approximately 10% on account of store closures and earlier-than-planned shipments in the quarter under review. Management informed that the last year quarter sales also benefited from the shipment of Women's Classic II. Moreover, Deckers envisions earnings in the range of approximately $1.00-$1.05 compared with $1.23 per share delivered in the year-ago period.Further, Deckers' over-reliance on the UGG brand is a matter of concern. In the event of stagnation or decline of UGG sales growth, the company's overall results will be adversely affected. This is because the percentage of contribution from the company’s other brands are too small to offset any slowdown in UGG sales.3 Retail Stocks Hogging the LimelightTop-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the retail sector includes, Big Lots, Inc.

2301,GPS,"Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) remains committed toward better price management, merchandise initiatives and cost containment. The company’s strategic endeavors have helped it to deliver better-than-expected numbers for the third straight quarter, as it posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Despite robust results, its shares have gained only 5.4%. However, the stock has outperformed the industry which has witnessed a decline of 3.2%. Let’s delve deeper and find out what is hindering Dollar General’s growth.Gross Margin Woes Taking a TollGross margin, an important financial metric, that gives an indication about the company’s health, has shown constant deceleration in the past four quarters. In the second quarter, gross margin contracted 47 basis points (bps) to 30.7%, following a decline of 34 bps to 30.3% in the preceding quarter due to higher markdowns and promotional activities along with a higher percentage of sales of consumables, which generally have lower margins in comparison with non-consumables. In the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2016, gross margin contracted 20 bps and 30 bps to 31.6% and 29.8%, respectively.Proposed Cut in SNAP Benefit a Major ObstacleReduction in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit has been haunting Dollar General for a long time and if President Trump’s proposed food stamp cut get passed, the situation could be worse. Trump suggests on reducing food stamps program by $193 billion, which is approximately 25% of the budget for the program. Cut in SNAP benefit will hamper the company’s performance as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict spending to low margin products. It has also stated that cut in SNAP program has impacted 56% of store base. However, the company stated that the impact of both price and SNAP benefits reduction has moderated in the second quarter.ConclusionDespite the above mentioned circumstances, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has kept it afloat in a competitive environment. Dollar General’s comparable-store sales growth story is impressive. Fiscal 2016 was the 27th consecutive year of comparable-store sales growth for the company. The company’s upbeat second-quarter fiscal 2017 performance and buyout of 285 Acquired Stores prompted management to raise earnings outlook. It now anticipates earnings in the band of $4.35-$4.50 per share, up from the earlier estimate of $4.25-$4.50.3 Retail Stocks Hogging the LimelightTop-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the retail sector includes, Big Lots, Inc.
