0,LYB,"You have to admire a stock that can buck the broad market's rocky sessions. LyondellBasell (LYB) has done just that in the past two weeks.
"
1,LYB,"Rotterdam, Netherlands-based LyondellBasell is a global big cap that produces a range of plastics for the packaging, home furnishings and auto parts industries.
"
2,LYB,"Plastics is a petrochemical, and L.yondellBasell is vertically integrated, starting with the refining process. In addition to plastics, LyondellBasell produces various gasoline blends, including ethanol and methanol.
"
3,LYB,"Unlike many leaders, LyondellBasell held fairly steady even as the S&P 500 marked its near-term high May 22 with a high-volume downside reversal.
"
4,LYB,"LyondellBasell scored a record high May 28. It added 2% and managed to close in the middle of its trading range.
"
5,LYB,"LyondellBasell struck another new high Tuesday, adding 0.37 to 67.68 in below-average volume. That puts it 3% above its 65.79 buy point from an eight-week cup.
"
6,LYB,"Volume on its breakout day, May 16, fell far shy of the 40% surge you want to see. But turnover for that week outpaced that for the prior week, which satisfies the volume requirement. The trouble is, one doesn't know as the stock breaks out how the weekly volume will stack up. No one said this would be easy.
"
7,LYB,"LyondellBasell quickly caused more anxiety. A three-day losing streak started May 20, and brought the stock down as much as 2% below its 65.79 buy point from its cup. But volume was dry during that slide.
"
8,LYB,"LyondellBasell started May 23 with a tumble, bringing its loss from the cup to 5% and putting it on track for a fourth straight decline. But the stock reversed higher, having found support near its 10-week moving average.
"
9,LYB,"The stock that day regained its buy point in slightly above-average volume — far better than the activity seen during the three-day slide. A move like that gives the impression that institutions are still interested in accumulating shares, although a bigger-volume surge would have been more convincing.
"
10,LYB,"LyondellBasell's steadiness is all the more impressive in light of the losses seen by dividend stocks since May 22. The SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY) ETF has sunk 4%, and is now testing its 50-day line. LyondellBasell, with a dividend that yields an annualized 3%, has a 9% cushion above its 50-day line.
"
11,LYB,"One must be careful with LyondellBasell. This recent base is a fourth-stage structure, and thus poses extra risk.
"
12,LYB,"And the company's earnings growth has been choppy. The past four quarterly reports showed EPS gains between -13% and 98%.

19,LYB,"Wholesale inventories dropped 0.3% in November, the Commerce Department said. That was even with October's slip and below expectations for no change.

89,LYB,"If you're in the National Basketball Association playoffs, you want Steph Curry or LeBron James on your team. If you're managing a retirement account or taxable portfolio, why not tap into the Fidelity Investments' brain trust, which includes an army of analysts? Knowing cumulative stock moves in Fidelity's many mutual funds can help you choose your own buys and sells.Not all Fidelity funds make the same buys and sells, but it's instructive to see which leading stocks Fidelity overall bet more of its shareholders' money on the first quarter and where it lightened its weightings. Normally you'd have to track down and then sift through Securities and Exchange Commission filings by each of Fidelity's 358 stock and balanced funds. But CFRA, an independent research firm, has done that and crunched the numbers for you already.What CFRA found is that Fidelity's biggest sector weights were in information technology and consumer discretionary. By the end of Q1, Fidelity had nearly 27% of its shareholders' money at work in tech. It had more than 15% of its shareholders cash placed in consumer discretionary stocks.""Heading into 2017, economically sensitive information technology stocks were poised to benefit from a risk-on environment,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of ETF and mutual fund research. ""Further, Fidelity offers a number of growth-oriented strategies that tend to favor tech stocks.""Among Fidelity's 75 largest stock positions across all of its stock and balanced portfolios, PayPal (PYPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were tech-sector stocks in which the Fidelity complex increased its Q1 share-count percentage the most.Fidelity added 6.4 million shares of PayPal, for a 16.8% increase. It added 4.3 million shares of Qualcomm, for an 8.3% hike.Fidelity's $110.7 billion Contrafund (FCNTX) — the firm's largest stock mutual fund — and $15.5 billion Magellan (FMAGX) were among the funds investing in PayPal as of their latest disclosures.Fidelity's $14.8 billion OTC (FOCPX) and $30.5 billion Balanced (FBALX) funds were holders of Qualcomm.Still, Fidelity made an even bigger percentage increase in its share count in LyondellBasell Industries (LYB). Adding 5.2 million shares across its funds, Fidelity's share count jumped nearly 31%.The Netherlands-based company makes chemicals and polymers that are used packaging, home furnishings and automotive components. A materials manufacturer like that stands to benefit from any global expansion in GDP, such as the one that appears to be underway.Fidelity's Magellan, Balanced and OTC funds were investors in LyondellBasell.Drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had the third-largest Q1 percentage boost in share count by Fidelity funds. The 2.7 million share boost was a 9.9% increase.Amgen is a leading seller of LDL cholesterol-battling drugs.

179,LYB,"U.S. chemical production fell slightly in February with lower output witnessed across all chemical producing regions barring the Northeast that witnessed a modest gain and Mid-Atlantic and West Coast that saw flat production – according to the latest monthly report from the American Chemistry Council (""ACC"").The chemical industry trade group said that the U.S. Chemical Production Regional Index (""CPRI"") edged down 0.1% in February on a monthly comparison basis. This follows a 0.3% drop a month ago and a 2.3% gain in December. The U.S. CPRI, which is measured using a three-month moving average, was created to track chemical production in seven regions nationwide.However, overall chemical production spiked 3.8% on a year over year basis in February with all regions racking up gains. This marks an improvement from a 3.4% growth in January.February Data Shows Mixed PictureThe February reading showed a decline in chemical production on a monthly comparison basis across four regions. Production in the Gulf Coast, where key building block materials are produced, was down 0.3% on a monthly comparison basis in the reported month. Production also fell 0.1% across Midwest, Ohio Valley and Southeast. Northeast was the only chemical producing region to rake in a gain in output with a 0.1% increase. Production was flat across Mid-Atlantic and West Coast.By segments, chemical production was mixed in February. Gains in basic inorganic chemicals, chlor-alkali, industrial gases, fertilizers, synthetic dyes and pigments, synthetic rubber, coatings and consumer products were neutralized by lower production in pesticides, manufactured fibers, adhesives, organic chemicals and plastic resins.U.S. Manufacturing Picks Up The manufacturing sector serves as a barometer to gauge the overall health of the U.S. economy and has a major influence on the chemical industry. Manufacturing activity is also a key indicator for chemical production.Per the ACC, activity for the U.S. manufacturing sector – the largest consumer of chemical products – rose 0.4% in February, following flat growth a month ago. The sector is a major driver for the chemical industry which touches around 96% of manufactured goods. Within the manufacturing sector, production rose in several chemistry-intensive industries in February including food and beverages, motor vehicles, construction supplies, fabricated metal products, computers and electronics, semiconductors and apparel.U.S. factory activity picked up pace in February, reaching its highest level since May 2004 on the back of improved sentiment among manufacturers and a strengthening global economy.U.S. Chemical Industry Set for Solid GrowthThe U.S. Chemical Industry has clawed its way back from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey and is set to ride high this year despite a few challenges. The ACC envisions national chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.7% in 2018.The growth is expected to be spurred by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets, capital investments and improved export markets. Major export markets such as Latin America and Asia are also expected to play a significant role in basic chemical production growth this year and the next. Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are also driving chemical demand across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing.The United States remains an attractive investment hotspot for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks and energy. This is driving investment in chemical production projects.Per the ACC, the chemical industry has invested $185 billion in new factories, expansions and restarts of plants across the United States with more than half of these projects presently in the planning stage. New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream.Chemical Stocks to ConsiderA few stocks that are worth considering in the chemicals space are Kronos Worldwide, Inc.

181,LYB,"Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (ASH  -  Free Report) will explore strategic alternatives for its Composites segment, as well as for the butanediol (BDO) manufacturing facility in Marl, Germany, and associated merchant Intermediates and Solvents (I&S) products.  This move is in sync with Ashland's vision of creating a premier specialty chemicals company. The company intends to consider all options with respect to the above assets, including a potential sale. The company plans to use the proceeds from the potential sale of these assets for debt reduction and share repurchases. It also intends to eliminate stranded costs from the possible assets sale. The company expects good financing availability, low interest rates, a healthy macroeconomic environment and the benefits of the latest tax reform to create a supportive backdrop for a potential sale of these assets. If the company eventually decides to divest the assets, it would expect to sign an agreement by 2018. With this, the company will have a more streamlined portfolio focused on specialty ingredients that will further improve margins and enhance shareholders value.   However, Ashland plans to retain its BDO plant in Lima, OH, to ensure consistent supply for its internal needs. Shares of Ashland have moved up 9.1% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 3.7% gain.    Ashland missed earnings and sales estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017). In the quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings came in at 46 cents per share, trailing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. Revenues increased roughly 19.6% year over year to $842 million in the quarter. The figure, however, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $860 million. For fiscal 2018, Ashland updated its adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $2.90-$3.10 per share owing to changes in the company’s effective tax rate. Also, the company raised effective tax rate expectation for the fiscal as a result of the recently enacted tax reform.

187,LYB,"Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) adopted a new shareholder rights plan, replacing the current one. The new plan will be effective from Mar 29.The new plan has been designed to ensure that shareholders get equal opportunity to take part in a takeover bid and receive full and fair value for the common shares of the company. It also ensures that the shareholders of Kinross Gold continue to reap the benefits of the current plan.Notably, the plan includes amendments to the legislative framework governing takeover bids in Canada, which came into force in 2016, including extending the minimum bid period to 105 days from 35 days earlier. Also, all non-exempt takeover bids will have to satisfy a minimum tender requirement of more than 50% of the outstanding securities held by independent shareholders and requiring an extension of minimum 10 days after the minimum tender requirement criteria is satisfied.Moreover, a target issuer also has the ability to voluntarily lessen the minimum bid period, but not less than 35 days, or it may be automatically reduced in case the board chooses to advance with an alternative change of control transaction.The rights issued under the new plan initially relate to and trade with the common shares and will become exercisable only when an individual (including any party related to it) attempts to or acquires 20% or more of the outstanding shares without complying with the provisions of the plan or without approval of the board of directors. In case of acquisitions or announcement of acquisition, each right will, upon exercise, entitle a rights holder, other than the acquiring individual (and related persons), to acquire the common stocks at 50% discount to the market price at that time.Subject to the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and shareholder ratification at the special and annual meeting of shareholders on May 9, 2018 as well as shareholder reconfirmation at annual shareholder meetings in 2021 and 2024, the plan will remain effective until the conclusion of the company’s annual shareholder meeting in 2027.Shares of Kinross Gold have lost 15.3% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 9.6% decline.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksKinross Gold currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

189,LYB,"The chemical industry has gotten its mojo back on an upswing in the global economy and strength across major end-use markets.

The gains in chemical production in the second quarter also marks a turnaround from a decline in output through the first quarter.The Global CPRI, which is measured using a three-month moving average, measures chemical production volumes for 33 major nations, sub-regions and regions. It is comparable to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) production indices.The ACC also noted that the Global CPRI went up 1.8% year over year on a three-month moving average basis. Capacity utilization for the global chemical industry moved up 0.4 percentage points to 84.9% in May.The results were favorable on a product basis in May. Growth was witnessed in agricultural chemicals, basic chemicals, specialty chemicals and consumer products.By regions, gains in production were seen across North America (up 0.6%), Europe (up 0.5%), Latin America (up 0.2%), Africa & the Middle East (up 0.3%) and the Asia-Pacific (up 1.1%) in the reported month.Per the ACC, chemical production in the United States went up 0.7% in May.

It expects production to continue to expand across all regions of the United States this year, with the Gulf Coast region — the epicenter of the U.S. specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry — seeing the strongest gains.

The industry's upswing is backed by a resurgent global economy and strength across major end-markets, such as construction and automotive.Improving fundamentals in the energy space — another key market for chemicals — has been a significant tailwind for the chemical industry. A rebound in crude oil prices has led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy market and a favorable pricing environment for chemical products as chemical prices essentially move in tandem with oil prices.The favorable Zacks Industry Rank of 53 carried by the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is a testimony to the fact that the chemical industry is in fine fettle. The favorable rank places the industry in the top 21% of the 250+ groups enlisted. Our back testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.Despite some headwinds including a spike in raw materials costs as a result of short supply, softness in agricultural commodity prices due to persistent grain glut and trade war risks, the industry's upturn is expected to continue through the remainder of 2018 as the fundamental driving factors remain firmly in place. Sustained demand strength across automotive and construction markets, a rebound in energy and investment on capacity expansion are expected to keep the industry on a positive growth trajectory.5 Stocks to Ride the Industry’s UpturnThe chemical industry has gotten its mojo back after being stuck in a rut for a spell, making it an attractive investment proposition.

202,LYB,"The chemical industry is riding an upturn in the global economy and strength across major end-use markets such as construction and automotive. Improving fundamentals in the energy space driven by an upswing in crude oil prices also augur well for the industry.Notwithstanding a few headwinds, including a spike in raw materials costs and softness in agricultural commodity prices, chemical companies are expected to continue the earnings momentum witnessed in Q1 into Q2 as the fundamental driving factors remain in place.Per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. The Basic Materials sector is among the Zacks sectors that racked up the strongest gains in Q1. Overall earnings for the sector climbed 56.4% while revenues spiked 24.3%. Earnings for the sector are projected to surge 54% in Q2 while revenues are expected to go up 24.1%, per our latest Earnings Preview.Cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to reap industry-wide margin improvements in Q2. Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking appropriate pricing actions (reflected by hikes in chemical prices) to offset raw materials cost inflation, which should also provide margin benefits.Chemical companies also remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and perk up growth. Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings in Q2.  President Donald Trump’s business-friendly tax reform also contributed to the impressive performance of the U.S. chemical makers in Q1 and would continue to be a major tailwind in Q2. The newly introduced tax reform significantly reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which is a positive for chemical stocks. This is expected to boost their bottom line, improve cash flows and incentivize capital investment.In this write up, we run a comparative analysis on two major chemical stocks – Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report) and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) – to figure out which of these stocks is better placed ahead of their Q2 earnings report. Both companies are scheduled to report their Q2 numbers on Jul 19.While Celanese carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), PPG is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let's take a closer look at how Celanese and PPG are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.ESP and Earnings HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Celanese is likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of +4.80% and a Zacks Rank #2. However, the picture is different for PPG with an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #3, a combination which makes surprise prediction difficult.With respect to surprise, Celanese beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 7%. On the other hand, PPG beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters while missed once and met expectations on the other occasion. In this timeframe, it came up with an average positive surprise of 0.1%.Growth ExpectationsIn terms of earnings growth expectations, Celanese scores above PPG. The expected earnings per share growth rate for Celanese for Q2 currently stands at 32.4% compared with an expected rise of 3.3% for PPG.Price PerformanceCelanese’s shares have rallied 16.7% over the past year and outperformed the industry over the same period. On the other hand, PPG’s shares have lost 6.3% and underperformed the industry. As such, Celanese clearly scores above PPG. Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. Celanese has a debt-to-equity ratio of 102.8, while the industry has debt-to-equity ratio of 34.5. In contrast, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 95.5 PPG wins this round. Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term debt obligations efficiently. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and versus the current level of liabilities. Here, Celanese is a winner with a current ratio of 1.88, which is superior to PPG’s reading of 1.76. Free Cash Flow YieldsCompanies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent on the stock.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for PPG stands at 3.6%, which is higher than 3% for Celanese. ValuationGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value chemical stocks, PPG looks cheaper compared with Celanese.Both Celanese and PPG are underpriced, with EV/EBITDA ratios of 12.3 and 11.2, respectively, compared with the industry’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.5. Clearly, PPG is cheaper and scores on this front. Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for Celanese and PPG is 35.2% and 26.5%, respectively. As such, Celanese hasan edge here. The VerdictOur comparative analysis shows that PPG holds an edge over Celanese in terms of valuation, free cash flow yields and debt-to-equity ratio. However, when considering price performance, earnings surprise history, earnings growth projections, ROE measures and current ratio, Celanese seems to be the preferred stock. On top of that, the company has a better ESP reading vis-à-vis PPG. As the scale is clearly tipped in favor of Celanese, it makes a better investment proposition.Some Other Stocks to Consider Apart from Celanese, investors interested in the chemical space may also consider FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report), both of which carry a Zacks Rank #2. FMC has an expected earnings growth of 258.3% for Q2. Its shares have gained roughly 23% over a year.LyondellBasell has an expected earnings growth of 4.3% for Q2. The company’s shares have rallied around 31% in a year.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

203,LYB,"LyondellBasell Industries (LYB  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results ahead of the bell on Apr 27. The company’s adjusted earnings came in at $2.73 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.52. Revenues increased roughly 18% year over year to $9,135 million in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,785 million. The company witnessed higher sales across its segments in the quarter. LyondellBasell surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 2.14%. Shares of the company have moved up 21.7% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 9.1% gain.    Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider LyondellBasell, in its fourth-quarter call, noted that strong global demand and delays in capacity additions across the industry have led to improved outlook for 2018. The company expects to realize the benefits of strong operating rates across its global portfolio of assets and continue to reap profits courtesy of the Houston refinery. The company expects strong contributions from its refinery in 2018 driven by the efforts to improve its reliability and performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for LyondellBasell for the first quarter stands at $9.4 billion, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of 11.4%. Revenues for LyondellBasell’s Intermediates and Derivatives segment for the soon-to-be reported quarter is projected to witness a 34.6% rise from the prior-year quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $2,291 million.  At the Olefins & Polyolefins – Americas segment, revenues are expected to rise 30.4% from the year-ago as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $2,758 million. Revenues from the Olefins & Polyolefins – Europe, Asia, International division is expected to increase 24.2% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is projected at $3,201 million for the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Refining segment is pegged at $1,726 million for the first quarter. This reflects an estimated 80.7% increase on a year over year basis. The Technology segment sales are expected to fall 6.8% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $123 million. LyondellBasell is benefiting from the favorable North American natural gas environment. It is executing its expansion projects to leverage the U.S. natural gas liquids advantage. The company’s expansion initiatives are expected to boost capacity and add to its earnings.  Moreover, LyondellBasell, in February, agreed to buy A. Schulman in a deal worth $2.25 billion. The company, last month, secured the U.S. antitrust clearance for its proposed buyout. The buyout doubles the size of LyondellBasell's existing compounding business. It also creates a platform for future growth with reach into additional high-growth markets such as packaging and consumer products, electronics and appliances, building and construction, and agriculture. The acquisition will enable the company to offer a comprehensive range of innovative solutions to customers. LyondellBasell expects to capture $150 million in run-rate cost synergies within two years. Moreover, LyondellBasell and SUEZ, last month, completed a transaction that makes them 50/50 partner in the Netherlands-based premium plastics recycling company, Quality Circular Polymers. For many years, LyondellBasell has been witnessing increased demand for reused and recycled plastics, particularly in Europe. The latest move helps the company to create an innovative system that can be scaled as the circular economy grows. The two partners will be able to leverage their respective strengths through this joint business. However, LyondellBasell’s operations remain subject to maintenance outages which is affecting its results. The company expects lost production due to a planned maintenance on one of its two crackers at Channelview during first and second quarter of 2018 to affect its results by roughly $100 million, with half of the impact expected in the first quarter. Moreover, the U.S. Gulf Coast experienced unusually cold weather during the third week of January 2018, causing disruptions across the industry and affecting the company’s assets. LyondellBasell expects these disruptions to reduce its first quarter results by roughly $45 million.  LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Quote Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not show that LyondellBasell is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

210,LYB,"LyondellBasell Industries N.V.’s (LYB  -  Free Report) consistent focus on HDPE project and the proposed buyout of A. Schulman bode well for the company. Evidently, it registered a year-over-year gain in top line over the past few quarters, courtesy of these strategic initiatives.In the past six months, the company’s shares have gained 12.1% compared with the industry’s decline of 1.7%. Yet, maintenance outages and raw material pricing pressure raise concerns. Let’s delve deeper.Key CatalystLyondellBasell remains on track with the construction of an HDPE plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast that will employ its proprietary Hyperzone PE technology. Also, it is constructing a world scale plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast for producing propylene oxide (PO) and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA). The plant will have annual capacity of 1 billion pounds of PO and 2.2 billion pounds of TBA and its derivatives. A major part of the company’s growth investment for 2018 (roughly 55% of total capital spending of $2.4 billion) will be allocated to these projects.LyondellBasell’s expected buyout of A. Schulman for $2.25 billion will create a premier global provider of advanced polymer solutions with extensive geographic reach, leading technologies and a diverse product portfolio. A. Schulman is a leading supplier of high-performance plastic compounds, composites and powders. The deal will double the size of LyondellBasell's existing compounding business and create a platform for future growth, with reach into additional high-growth markets such as packaging and consumer products, electronics and appliances, building and construction and agriculture. LyondellBasell expects to realize cost synergies of $150 million within two years. The buyout is also expected to be accretive to earnings within the first full year, following its closure.LyondellBasell remains committed to deliver greater value to its shareholders leveraging healthy cash flows. It bought back 10 million shares in 2017, returning $866 million to its shareholders. LyondellBasell also recently raised its quarterly dividend by 11%. It generated operating cash flows of more than $1 billion in the most recently reported quarter.ConcernsOf late, interruptions, including maintenance outages, have been hurting the company’s  production capacity and results. First-quarter 2018 results were affected by loss in production due to a planned maintenance on one of its two crackers at the Channelview facility. The company incurred a loss of around $50 million and expects another $50 million impact in the second quarter.The company is hurt by weak ethylene prices that continue to weigh on its U.S. olefin margins. Strong industry supply and higher inventory have led to weak ethylene pricing environment over the past few months.LyondellBasell is facing headwinds related to volatility in raw material and energy costs that account for a major portion of its operating costs. Higher feedstock and energy costs led to a 15% year-over-year increase in its cost of sales in the last-reported quarter. The company saw a rise in propylene feedstock costs in the quarter.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLyondellBasell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked companies in the basic materials space are FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report), Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) and The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report).

217,LYB,"LyondellBasell Industries N.V.'s (LYB  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this chemical giant an intriguing choice for investors right now.What Makes LYB an Attractive Pick?Solid Rank & VGM Score: LyondellBasell currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.An Outperformer: LyondellBasell has trounced the industry over a year. The company’s shares have rallied around 28.7% over this period, compared with roughly 5.8% growth recorded by the industry. Attractive Valuation: Going by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value chemical stocks, LyondellBasell is currently trading at trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.1, much cheaper compared with the industry average of 12.5.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): LyondellBasell’s ROE of 53.6%, as compared with the industry average of 9.2%, manifests the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds.Upbeat Prospects: LyondellBasell, during its first-quarter call, said that it sees seasonal margin improvements in oxyfuels and refining. It also expects to benefit from continued high operating rates in the second quarter. Per management, the imbalance between ethylene production and consumption is expected to improve as the downstream derivative units attain full operating rates. The company also noted that strong global demand and higher oil prices continue to support strong polyolefin pricing.LyondellBasell is executing its expansion projects to leverage the U.S. natural gas liquids advantage. It remains on track with the construction of an HDPE plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast that will employ its proprietary Hyperzone PE technology. The facility is expected to have an annual capacity of 1.1 billion pounds. LyondellBasell is also constructing a world scale plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast for producing propylene oxide (PO) and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA), which will have an annual capacity of 1 billion pounds of PO and 2.2 billion pounds of TBA and its derivatives.A major part of the company’s growth investment for 2018 will be allocated to these projects. The company’s expansion initiatives are expected to boost capacity and add to its earnings.LyondellBasell and SUEZ, earlier this year, also completed a transaction that makes them 50/50 partner in the Netherlands-based premium plastics recycling company, Quality Circular Polymers. For many years, LyondellBasell has been witnessing increased demand for reused and recycled plastics, particularly in Europe. The move helps the company to create an innovative system that can be scaled as the circular economy grows. The two partners will be able to leverage their respective strengths through this joint business.Moreover, LyondellBasell, in February, agreed to buy A. Schulman in a deal worth $2.25 billion, a move that will create a premier global provider of advanced polymer solutions with extensive geographic reach, leading technologies and a diverse product portfolio. A. Schulman is a leading supplier of high-performance plastic compounds, composites and powders.The company recently secured the approval from the European Commission for the proposed buyout. The acquisition, which has also been cleared by antitrust regulators in the United States, Brazil, China, Serbia, Turkey and Mexico, is expected to consummate in second-half 2018.The buyout doubles the size of LyondellBasell's existing compounding business. It also creates a platform for future growth with reach into additional high-growth markets such as packaging and consumer products, electronics and appliances, building and construction, and agriculture. The acquisition will enable the company to offer a comprehensive range of innovative solutions to its customers.LyondellBasell expects to capture $150 million in run-rate cost synergies within two years. The buyout is also expected to be accretive to earnings within the first full year following its closure.LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Price and Consensus  LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

The company’s shares have gained around 13% over this period, compared with roughly 17.6% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings Whispers Our proven model shows that DowDuPont is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for DowDuPont is currently pegged at +1.37%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 68 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 67 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DowDuPont currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Watch ForDowDuPont, in the third quarter, gained from higher volumes and pricing, solid demand in most of its core end-markets as well as increased equity earnings that more than offset higher feedstock costs, weak agriculture market conditions and unfavorable impacts of hurricanes.The company, in its third-quarter call, said that it sees adjusted net sales to be in the range of $19 billion to $19.5 billion for the fourth quarter, a more than 7% growth from the comparable quarter a year ago.

The company is expected to continue to gain from higher volumes (driven by strong demand) and pricing coupled with new product penetrations and improved mix in the December quarter, offsetting headwinds from raw material cost inflation. Strong growth in semiconductors and consumer electronics is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.The company also expects its agriculture business to return to growth in the fourth quarter with sales growing around 10% on a year over year basis, supported by increased fungicide sales, higher corn volumes in Latin America and portfolio benefits. The division’s sales, in the third quarter, was hit by lower volumes and pricing, challenges from lower planted corn area in Brazil and a delayed start to the country’s summer season.DowDuPont also said that demand outlook remains positive for most of its key end-markets. It will remain focused on executing its near-term priorities that include delivering earnings and cash flow growth, executing its $3-billion cost synergy initiatives and advancing activities to create three growth companies in Agriculture, Materials Science and Specialty Products businesses. DowDuPont also declared it will take actions to enable cost savings of $3 billion. These include workforce reductions, buildings and facilities consolidations and select asset shutdowns. DowDuPont recorded pre-tax charges of $180 million in the third quarter in connection with the actions. It expects to record total pre-tax charges of around $2 billion, with around $1 billion expected in the fourth quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.27% and carries a Zacks Rank #1.Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +20.99% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

220,LYB,"The Q4 earnings season is off to a stellar start and is likely to pick up pace with more releases flowing in. This has helped most of the leading benchmark indices to trade near record highs. The stock market euphoria is likely to extend further on tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data, boosting corporate earnings, stoking investments and trickling down to employees in some instances.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:CBRE Group, Inc. : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm.

222,LYB,"Economic growth of a country is generally determined through its infrastructural developments, industrial growth, foreign trade relations, agricultural capacity, technological advancements and many more. The U.S. economy has exhibited impressive growth, with its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rising roughly 9.5% in the past five years.The road ahead seem to be quite smooth for the country with an expanding global economy — as evident from the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) growth projection of 3.9% for 2018 versus 3.7% in 2017 and 3.2% in 2016 — and domestic reforms — like the implementation of Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017, enabling corporates to invest more in growth projects — likely being the prime accelerating forces. However, roadblocks — like import tariffs on steel and aluminium and its subsequent impacts in the form of retaliatory measures by foreign nations — cannot be completely overlooked.The country’s equity universe has responded well to all the developments in the recent past. Major stock indexes including the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ surged 10.4%, 15.2% and 18.3% respectively in the last year. We believe the country’s fundamentals are strong enough to counter challenges.Favorable Indicators — U.S. Manufacturing in FocusA lot of economic indicators support the country’s growth trajectory. GDP grew 2.3% year over year in 2017 while its expansion rate has been estimated at 2.7% for 2018 by the IMF.The housing market has strengthened over time, while unemployment rate fell from 4.7% in February 2017 to 4.1% in the comparable month this year. Also, governmental investment plans for infrastructural development, when implemented, will boost growth opportunities for a number of industries.Industrial production — a key economic indicator measuring the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country — expanded 4.4% year over year in February. This marked the highest increase on a year-over-year basis since March 2011. Mining expanded 9.7%, utilities 10.5% and manufacturing 2.5%.Also, month-over-month growth of 1.7 percentage points in the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index for February suggests expanding economic activities in the manufacturing sector. Healthier business conditions, favorable export orders and production, solid backlog and employment growth were some of the supporting aspects. Moreover, roughly 83% of the 18 manufacturing industries flourished in February, such as machinery, print and related services, primary metals and metal products. Electricity in Manufacturing SectorGenerally, an expanding economy tends to demand more electricity. From 2000 to 2017, electricity consumption in the United States grew 6.3%. Electricity is considered vital in nearly all the forms of manufacturing industries and in nearly all the stages of manufacturing process.As a rule of thumb, electricity demand should have spiked in this sector as well. On the contrary, data available from 2006 to 2016 suggests that electricity demand in the manufacturing sector declined in these years. Does the fall in electricity demand suggest poor performance of the sector?Actually, decline in electricity demand in the sector can be primarily attributed to a growing trend among manufactures to produce electricity at their operation sites. This onsite electricity generation has enabled manufacturers to satisfy their electricity needs internally to some extent — varying from 11% to 13% from 2006 to 2016. Electricity purchases from the grids have hovered around 87-89% range over the same time period.Technological advancements as well as governmental incentives/grants have been aiding manufactures to set up electricity generation systems at their sites. Combined heat and power (CHP) technology is one of the favored means. This technology helps in efficient usage of electricity, absence of electricity lost in transmission and provides other operational benefits.Available data suggests that nearly 97% of the total 110 million megawatt hours of electricity produced by U.S. manufactures in 2016 came from primary metals, food, paper, petroleum and coal and chemicals industries.We believe that companies in these industries might be of interest to investors wishing to gain from the expanding manufacturing sector in the United States.

227,LYB,"Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (ASH  -  Free Report) has launched Derakane Signia resins for the corrosion industry. The latest product comes with a new formula that has an undeniable detection system to verify the integrity of designs. The resins offer the same corrosion resistance and has mechanical properties with improved processing. Prior to this, design engineers and end users had specified Ashland Derakane resins for FRP piping and tanks, in safety-critical markets like chemical processing, air pollution control, mineral processing and water treatment. Signia improves manufacturing efficiencies and lowers emission with an innovative styrene suppressant technology. The resins are formulated to provide a no-prep surface, increased secondary bonding and reduced gassing for faster consolidation and less processing time and labor. It also helps in reducing odor and dust that improves overall work environment for employees and provides a longer shelf life to maintain workability for an extended time frame. Shares of Ashland have gained 3.8% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 3.8% decline.    For fiscal 2018, Ashland updated its adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $2.90-$3.10 per share owing to changes in the company’s effective tax rate. Also, the company raised effective tax rate expectation for the fiscal as a result of the recently enacted tax reform. This, in turn, is expected to reduce fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings by roughly 30 cents per share. For second-quarter fiscal 2018, Ashland projects adjusted earnings in the range of 80-90 cents per share compared with 70 cents in the prior-year period. The company expects the benefit of pricing actions to be partly offset in the quarter by the impact of the planned maintenance shutdown in the Marl, Germany, facility.  Ashland Global Holdings Inc.

231,LYB,"PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Jan 18. Last quarter, PPG Industries reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.52 per share against the year-ago loss of 79 cents. Earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales increased 3.2% year over year to $3,776 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,748 million. PPG Industries surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.25%. However, the company underperformed the industry over the past six months. While PPG Industries’ shares have gained around 4.6%, the industry gained roughly 17.4%.   Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors at Play PPG Industries, in its third-quarter call, said that it expects continued moderate global economic growth. Post the mayhem caused by the recent natural disasters, the company does not anticipate any further decline in the level of raw material cost inflation. In the third quarter, currency exchange translation had favorable impact on the company’s performance and is expected to remain a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter.  Furthermore, the company sees an additional increase in selling price. Also, it remains on track with its restructuring program that is expected to deliver savings of more than $45 million for full-year 2017.  PPG Industries is also taking steps for growing organically as well as cutting costs. The company also remains committed to deploy cash on acquisitions and share repurchases. The company’s board, last month, authorized it to buyback outstanding common stock worth $2.5 billion. However, lingering impacts of natural disasters (hurricanes and earthquakes) may continue to affect sales volume and margins in the fourth quarter. PPG Industries expects natural disasters to unfavorably impact fourth-quarter earnings by up to 5 cents per share. Some raw material inflation is also expected in the fourth quarter due to supply related issues. For the company’s the Industrial Coatings segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is expected to be $1,523 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an estimated 2.5% rise on a sequential comparison basis. Segment income is also expected to increase 7.1% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $240 million for the fourth quarter. Net sales for PPG Industries’ Performance Coatings segment, for the fourth quarter is expected to witness a 10.1% decline from the previous quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues for the unit is pegged at $2,059 million. Segment income is also expected to decline 35.1% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $237 million for the fourth quarter. The segment is expected to be affected by the adverse impact of natural disasters.PPG Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PPG Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PPG Industries, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that PPG Industries is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for PPG Industries is currently pegged at -1.85%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.17 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.19. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PPG Industries carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies in the chemical space that investors may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.2% and a Zacks Rank #2.

232,LYB,"The U.S. Chemical is witnessing continued investments, strengthening export markets and robust demand across key-end markets like electronics, automotive and construction. These factors have helped the industry outpace the broader market over the past year despite many headwinds including sluggishness in China, weak demand in agriculture and damaging effects of the hurricanes.Industry PerformanceThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has outperformed the broader market over a year. The industry has gained around 30.7% over this period, topping S&P 500’s corresponding return of roughly 21.5%.Investments Continues to Drive GrowthThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry trade group, envisions national chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.7% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2019. Higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets, capital investments and improved export markets are like to drive growth.According to the ACC, the United States remains a valuable destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks and energy. This is driving investment in chemical production projects.The trade group noted that roughly 320 chemical projects have been announced worth more than $185 billion, 62% of which is foreign direct investment. Moreover, roughly 65% of the chemical investment announced since 2010 are complete or under construction. New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream.The trade group expects capital spending in the chemical industry to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.Strong Export Markets Bode WellThe ACC expects improving export markets to contribute to solid growth of the domestic chemical industry. Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are driving chemical demand across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing. Housing activity is expected rise to 1.29 million in 2018 from 1.2 million in 2017.Total chemical exports went up 4.9% to $127 billion in 2017 while imports rose 2.8% to $96 billion, the trade group noted.The trade group also expects basic chemicals production to increase 4.7% in 2018 and 5.2% in 2019 on the back of new capacity additions. Major export markets such as Latin America and Asia are expected to play a significant role in production growth.Robust Demand Across Key-End MarketsChemical makers continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors – major chemical end-use markets. A recovery across housing and commercial construction markets has been a tailwind for the chemical industry. The underlying trends in the housing space remain healthy, backed by steady buyer demand, low mortgage rates, high homebuilders’ confidence, low unemployment levels and rising rent costs.The automotive sector also continues its bullish run amid certain challenges, supported by an improving job market, rising personal income, improved consumer confidence, low fuel prices, impressive vehicle launches and attractive financing options.Last year, gains in specialty chemicals were led by improvements in adhesives, oilfield and mining chemicals and electronic chemicals. Production in the segment is expected to grow 2.3% in 2018.Another positive for the industry is a recovery in demand in the energy space – a key chemical end-market that had been out of favor for a while. The recovery has been driven by the rebound in crude oil prices. The recent uptrend in oil prices has been supported by a decline in U.S. oil stockpiles and extension of oil production cuts by OPEC and other major world producers until the end of 2018. Improving fundamentals in the energy space is expected to support chemical demand next year.4 Chemical Stocks to Scoop UpThe U.S. chemical industry’s upturn is expected to continue this year on the back of continued demand strength across major end-markets and significant capital investment. Amid such a backdrop, it would be a prudent idea to invest in chemical stocks with compelling growth prospects if you are looking to reap solid returns from your portfolio in 2018.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.

234,LYB,"This Global Week Ahead for stocks is starting off on the wrong foot -- Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) shares fell -4% in pre-market trading, outpacing a wider drop across tech stocks. As FANG stocks go down, so go major stock indexes these days.Claims surfaced over last weekend: A data analytics firm hired by the Trump presidential campaign harvested data on ~50 million Facebook users without consent.A former Cambridge Analytica employee showed documents to the New York Times and the U.K.’s The Observer. The news outlets said it detailed a program that used data from a survey run on Facebook without users’ permission.Shortly, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, will be on his way to testify to a U.K. House of Commons committee charged with the investigation.Now, let’s look at the rest of this Global Week Ahead using the following five Reuters in London big themes. These are the ones likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders.I ranked them in order of importance, from an equity market perspective. I also updated where appropriate.(1) Powell Fed Rate Hike of 25 Basis PointsOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the U.S. Fed’s first meeting with new head Jerome Powell at the helm takes place. An interest rate rise — this year’s first — is seen as a done deal.Against the backdrop of brewing inflationary pressures, mortgage rates and Treasury yields have been rising. And risk assets including equities and junk debt prices have been exhibiting signs of stress.World investors will be paying close attention to the wording of the Fed statement for clues on whether Powell & Co. think conditions are now strong enough to hike rates beyond the three the financial markets have been forecasting.Oh, and what they think about the risk of a global trade war.(2) First Deal Between the U.K. and Eurozone Leaders on BrexitOn Monday, U.K. officials announced they believed a Brexit transition deal had been agreed between Prime Minister Theresa May’s government and the European Union. Bloomberg News reported.It is now awaiting a sign-off from U.K. Brexit Secretary David Davis and chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, according to two people familiar with the situation.In turn, this week will be a big one for sterling traders. The pound has made a solid recovery — against the dollar at least — over the last year. “Long” positions on cable are only fractionally below a three-year high.If there was no sign of a deal — and a “hard” Brexit suddenly became the base case again — the U.K. currency would have almost certainly gone skidding again.That doesn’t appear to be the case on Monday.On Thursday, there will also be a Bank of England meeting.A transition deal might give it cover to strike a more confident tone on further rate hikes this year.(3) Bearish Bets Grow on European EquitiesHedge funds have been ramping up their bets against European equities in recent weeks. “Short” demand for European equities is now up 18 percent year-to-date, and the current total short position is $188 billion, just below a post-euro crisis high of $193 billion hit a month ago.With a strong economic backdrop and more attractive valuations than U.S. equities, what’s pushing investors to short the European market?The strong euro is one reason why hedge funds think the region’s corporate earnings won’t live up to share prices. And political risk — the main reason why short positions increased last year — reared has its head again with the complicated outcome of Italian elections this month.But another reason may be strategic: Analysts say it has been cheaper to “short” a basket of big European names than those from across the pond. European stocks also have a higher “beta,” or correlation, than U.S. stocks to the broader market when it is going down.So a bet against Europe may simply be the most efficient way to bet against markets overall.(4) Moody’s Set to Rate South African Debt – Russia Comes Under StressEmerging market investors’ love for South Africa and Russia will be severely tested, with Moody’s set to deliver a long-awaited verdict on South Africa’s last remaining investment grade credit rating by March 23, and Russia is facing Western condemnation over a nerve agent attack on British soil just as Vladimir Putin limbers up for another presidential election win.South African assets have rallied hard this year on a turnaround ticket, with new President Cyril Ramaphosa pledging to fight corruption, implement much-need structural reforms and kickstart growth. The country’s bonds are currently international investors’ top “overweight” in portfolios linked to JPMorgan’s GBI-Emerging Markets index so the rating call could be tense.Russian assets have come under scrutiny, amid the potential for more biting and globally coordinated sanctions on Moscow if the spy poisoning case escalates.So far, bond investors appear largely unperturbed. There was strong interest for a new Russian Eurobond which landed on big funds’ desks just as Britain and the United States were expelling dozens of Russian diplomats.(5) Fresh Central Bank Head in New ZealandThe March 22 meeting at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand should be eventful, but not for the normal reasons, for almost no one expects a change in rates. But the RBNZ is having a change of guard. Adrian Orr takes over as governor on March 27 from Grant Spencer.A new Policy Target Agreement (PTA), which is to be signed between the incoming governor and the country’s finance minister, must also be released before Orr takes over. It could allude to the employment objective that the government wants to include in the RBNZ mandate and is seeking parliamentary approval for.As for interest rates, markets expect no change until mid-2019.Economic conditions – growth seen slightly above last year’s, below-target inflation, a stable currency and rising share prices – validate those expectations.New governor Orr has worked for the RBNZ before and is considered a continuity candidate, analysts warn against taking a change of guard for granted though. They cite the example of Philip Lowe at the Reserve Bank of Australia, who surprised markets with his focus on financial stability.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—(A) Boeing (BA  -  Free Report): This $194B in market cap aerospace giant’s stock is in the crosshairs. This company is a very global trade-related franchise. So trade war worries play out here.

This is because prices of steel across the platform have been improving throughout the quarter aided by strong steel demand in domestic market.Moreover, Steel Dynamics expects this improving steel consumption and pricing momentum to continue during the year supported by strong steel demand fundamentals and customer optimism. The company also believes the recent steel trade actions taken by the U.S. Federal Administration are likely to reduce imports.Steel Dynamics anticipates profitability of its metals recycling platform to improve sequentially on the back of higher shipments as the demand for recycled ferrous material from the domestic steel sector increased during the quarter.However, earnings of its steel fabrication business are expected to decline sequentially due to seasonally lower shipments.

The latest move follows a series of price increases announced last month.Shares of Ashland have moved up 12.8% over the past six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s 0.5% dip. Ashland missed earnings and sales estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017).

The figure, however, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $860 million.For fiscal 2018, Ashland updated its adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $2.90-$3.10 per share owing to changes in the company’s effective tax rate.

Last month, ArcelorMittal and NSSMC announced that they have inked a JV deal under which both companies will co-manage and co-own Essar Steel, provided AMIPL’s bid is successful.NSSMC is a leading steel company in Japan with the capacity to produce roughly 50 million tons of crude steel per annum.

The companies made a major investment program following the acquisition, which focused on improving the facility's finishing lines to enable the production of higher-added value steel products, increase slab staging capacity and efficiency.These investments helped AM/NS Calvert to rapidly improve its performance by increasing capacity utilization rates by more than 20%. Moreover, the shipments to the automotive sector more than doubled between 2015 and 2017 while the productivity of the hot strip mill increased by more than 1 million tons since the acquisition.ArcelorMittal stated that the aim of the resolution process is to find a new, capable and strong owner for Essar Steel and maximize returns to the creditors.

The big integrated steel-making facility in Hazira requires technological expertise and dedicated knowledge to expand, de-bottleneck and improve its product portfolio. The companies intend to commit considerable capital expenditure to grow the asset, bring in their proprietary processes and patents along with new high-quality products to India for industries including solar and automotive.Shares of ArcelorMittal have moved up 18.3% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 13.1% growth.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderArcelorMittal currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

243,LYB,"Investors have been on the edge since Trump hinted at possibilities of missile attacks on Syria. As tensions gradually eased with the U.S. President clarifying that attacks (if at all) were not imminent, the market took a breather with bank stocks leading the rebound on solid earnings expectations.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that rake in higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen:Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP  -  Free Report): Incorporated in Delaware in 1989, Microchip develops and manufacturers microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.

It also remains committed to boosting shareholder returns by leveraging healthy cash flows. However, LyondellBasell is exposed to volatility in raw material and energy costs that account for a major portion of its operating costs. The low oil price environment remains a headwind for the company.  LyondellBasell Industries NV Price and EPS Surprise  LyondellBasell Industries NV Price and EPS Surprise | LyondellBasell Industries NV QuoteEarnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show that LyondellBasell is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

This is not the case here as you will see below: Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for LyondellBasell is currently pegged at -0.98%.

261,LYB,"We believe that Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (KRO  -  Free Report) is a solid choice for investors seeking exposure in the chemical space. Development of new products and improvement of existing facilities as well as solid customer base in paper, coatings and plastics end markets and overseas markets like Europe and the Asia Pacific will work in the company’s favor.The stock, with roughly $2.8 billion market capitalization, has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on Mar 13. Its investment appeal is further accentuated by a VGM Score of A.Kronos Worldwide delivered better-than-expected earnings in three of the last four quarters, recording an average positive earnings surprise of 35.01%. Notably, the shares have rallied 9.8% in the last six months, outperforming 7.2% gain of the industry. Why the Upgrade?We are providing a snapshot of how Kronos Worldwide fared in the fourth quarter of 2017. Its earnings of 84 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 71.43%. Net sales were up 36% year over year on the back of the rise in TiO2 sales volume and its average selling prices.In the quarters ahead, we believe that expertise in the manufacturing of TiO2 products and providing related services to its customers in paper, coatings and plastics end markets will work in favor of Kronos Worldwide. Also, strengthening operations in international arenas — Europe accounted for 50% of TiO2 sales volume in 2017 while the Asia Pacific and the rest of the world accounted for 9% and 10%, respectively — and effective marketing strategies will be advantageous.Research and development, aimed at uplifting the product quality, production process and application areas, remain a priority for Kronos Worldwide. In the present year, the company plans to spend approximately $19 million on research and development while its capital spending for the maintenance and improvement of existing facilities will total at $67 million. It anticipates its sales to grow over 2017-level, mainly driven by the expectation of higher average selling prices. Also, income from operations is anticipated to grow year over year with higher raw materials, partially offsetting the gains from higher average selling prices.Also, the company remains focused on returning value to shareholders. In February 2018, the company announced 2 cents per share or roughly 13.3% hike in its quarterly dividend rate. Repurchase authorization of roughly 1.95 million shares was left at the end of 2017.In the last 30 days, earnings estimates for Kronos Worldwide have been revised upward by one brokerage firm for 2018.

262,LYB,"The Q3 earnings season is off to a slow start and is likely to pick up pace with more releases flowing in. Although earnings growth is trending lower than in comparable periods, expectations are high that the current quarter will likely continue with the healthy growth momentum of the past few quarters.     As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 28 stocks that qualified the screen:Monsanto Company : Missouri-based Monsanto is a leading global provider of agricultural products.

263,LYB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, LyondellBasell has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.2. This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.7.If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts LyondellBasell’s current PE above its median over the observed period (which stands at 9.9x). Hence, we could infer that the stock is overvalued in this respect, especially in light of its historical trend.Nevertheless, the stock’s PE compares favorably with its industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that LyondellBasell has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 10 – lower than the current level. So, it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for LyondellBasell stock in the near term.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, LyondellBasell has a P/S ratio of about 1.2. This is lower than the industry average, which comes in at 1.7x right now.LYB is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, LyondellBasell currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look.

267,LYB,"The chemical industry demonstrated a stellar performance in fourth-quarter 2017. A host of companies in the space delivered better-than-expected earnings driven by strategic measures like pricing actions, improving productivity, restructuring of portfolio and earnings-accretive acquisitions along with continued strong demand across automotive and construction markets. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s business-friendly tax reform contributed to the impressive performance.The chemical industry is grouped under the Zacks Basic Materials sector, which was among the Zacks sectors that scored the strongest gains in the fourth quarter. Overall earnings for the sector climbed 45.2% while revenues jumped 21.3%. Around 89.5% of the sector participants posted earnings beat and around 73.7% surpassed revenue expectations.How are Things Shaping Up in the Chemical Industry?The chemical industry is benefiting from a resurgent global economy and strength across major end-use markets including automotive and construction. Moreover, the fundamentals across the energy space, another key market for chemicals, have been improving lately. A rebound in crude oil prices has helped recover demand for chemicals in the energy market.Healthy Demand and Exports to Drive U.S. Chemical: The U.S. chemical industry is likely to benefit from capital investments, higher demand across housing markets and light vehicles and improving export markets.Latin America and Asia — two of the key export markets for the industry — are expected to play a significant role in the growth of basic chemical production this year and the next. Moreover, strengthening export markets along with increasing capital spending have been driving the demand for chemicals across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing.  Per the industry trade group, American Chemistry Council (“ACC”), the U.S. chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) is expected to rise 3.7% in 2018 and further accelerate to 3.9% in 2019.Continued Investments to Boost Growth: The United States remains an attractive destination for investment and the domestic chemical makers continue enjoying the availability of cheaper and abundant feedstocks and energy, which is driving investments in chemical projects.The chemical industry invested $185 billion in restarting plants, expansions and building new factories across the United States with more than 50% of these projects under the planning stage, per the ACC. This is likely to boost capacity and exports in the long run.Revival of the EU Chemical Industry: The European chemical industry is finally experiencing an upturn after a long time, thanks to an improving global economic sentiment and positive developments across the Eurozone, which is driven by factors like monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank, declining unemployment, strengthening consumer and business confidence.Per the European Chemical Industry Council (“CEFIC”), chemical output in the EU rose above the pre-economic crisis level for the first time in fourth-quarter 2017. CEFIC projects the chemical output in EU to rise 2% year over year in 2018.How Dividend Paying Stocks Can Boost Your PortfolioIn addition to the positive developments mentioned earlier, we believe that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be another major tailwind for dividend paying stocks in the chemical space.The newly introduced tax reform significantly reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which is a positive for chemical stocks. This is expected to boost their bottom line, improve cash flows and incentivize capital investment. Moreover, many of the companies are likely to pay more dividends and buyback shares reaping the benefits of the new tax law.5 Top-Notch Dividend PlayersWe have employed the Zacks Stocks Screener to find chemical companies that offer a dividend yield of more than 2% and sport a favorable Zacks Rank.Below we highlight five top-ranked chemical stocks that offer attractive dividend yield and also boast solid long-term growth prospects.LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

272,LYB,"The shale gas revolution in the United States has been a huge driving force behind chemical investments in plants and equipment in the country. And currently, the U.S. petrochemical industry is in the middle of a shale-induced investment boom leveraging access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks. However, the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing is expected to play spoilsport.President Donald Trump, who has a record of attacking China for unfair trade practices, recently proposed sweeping tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China. The President’s decision to levy tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese goods came after a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports slapped by the Trump administration that went into effect on Mar 23.President Trump’s protectionist actions enraged the Red Dragon with Beijing retaliating with plans of imposing tariffs on more than 100 American products with shipment values worth as much as $50 billion, bringing the world’s two largest economies close toward a full-blown trade war.China on Wednesday declared that it would levy additional tariffs of 25% on an array of U.S. products including soybeans, cars, planes, beef, corn, whiskies and chemicals. Notably, chemicals comprise roughly 40% of the products targeted by the planned tariffs. China had earlier slapped tariffs on about $3 billion worth of U.S. imports.The Trump administration responded with a proposed $100 billion in additional tariffs on China yesterday, further intensifying the trade tussle between the two countries.China’s proposed countermeasures, if enforced, are likely to harm the U.S. chemical industry which is currently on an upswing.Shale Bounty Fueling U.S. Chemical InvestmentThe U.S. Chemical Industry has clawed its way back from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey and is set to ride the growth wave this year. According to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), a leading industry trade group, expects chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.7% in 2018 with capital investments on chemical projects are expected to play a key role in the growth.A recovery in manufacturing, rising business investment and a rebound in domestic oil and gas production has set the stage for significant expansion and capital investment, per the ACC.Major export markets such as Latin America and Asia are also expected to play a significant role in basic chemical production growth in 2018 and 2019. Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are also driving chemical demand across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing.The United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of cheap ethane feedstock extracted from shale. This is driving investment in chemical production projects. Petrochemical makers are significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas.New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) are boosting shale production, bringing down prices of ethane (derived from shale gas) in the process.The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities (crackers) in the United States to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost-effective way. Chemical makers including DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report), BASF SE (BASFY  -  Free Report) and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report), Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and Westlake Chemical Corp.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.According to the ACC, 320 new chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth more than $185 billion, 62% of which is foreign direct investment. Such investments — many backed by Federal government support — are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years.  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream.Chemical industry capital spending continues to go up, clocking $38 billion in 2017, per the ACC. This also accounts for one-half of overall construction spending by the manufacturing sector. The trade group expects capital spending to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.But Trade War Could Dampen U.S. Investments & ExportsThe Trump administration’s actions to impose heavy tariffs on steel imports and the threats of tariffs on U.S. chemical exports by China are detrimental to the U.S. chemical industry. These moves are expected to dampen new chemical investment in the United States, hurt U.S. chemical exports and harm the domestic chemical industry’s competitiveness. All these may eventually lead to a slowdown in growth in the American chemical industry.The steel tariffs would discourage chemical makers spending billions of dollars on new projects. These hefty tariffs will lead to a spurt in steel prices, which in turn, are likely to push up the costs of building petrochemical plants in the United States that use a significant amount of steel, thereby eroding the economic benefits of these projects. As steel costs constitute a significant portion of the costs of constructing these plants, this may discourage many companies from continuing their projects.    Notably, DowDuPont, which completed construction spending worth $6 billion in petrochemical projects along the U.S. Gulf Coast last year, had raised concerns that the tariffs on U.S. steel imports could add hundreds of millions of dollars in costs to its planned chemical project on the U.S. Gulf Coast.Chemical industry groups have also expressed their discontent about the brewing trade war. The ACC recently said that China is among the most important trading partners of the U.S. chemical industry, importing 11% (or $3.2 billion) of all U.S. plastic resins last year. The trade group is worried that 40% of the products to which Beijing has assigned new tariffs are chemicals including polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polycarbonates.The ACC said that “engaging in a trade war with one of our country’s most significant trading partners is not the answer. We strongly urge both the U.S. and Chinese governments to work together to come to a satisfactory and mutually beneficial decision before this situation escalates further.”According to the ACC, out of the announced investments by the chemical industry in new factories, expansions and restarts of plants across the United States, more than half of the projects are currently in the planning stage. The trade group is worried that the trade tariffs may force investors to consider doing business elsewhere.China is one of the biggest export markets for U.S. chemicals and thus, leaves the American chemical industry heavily exposed to Beijing’s planned retaliatory trade actions. The prospects of tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U.S. chemical products in this major market. This is worrisome as export markets are expected to significantly contribute to the growth of the U.S. chemical industry this year and the next.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                                                                                                                                            Here's another stock idea to consider.

273,LYB,"Hurricane Harvey ravaged Texas, dumping more than 50 inches of rain — a record high from a single tropical storm. Texas Governor Greg Abbott estimated the damage at $150 billion to $180 billion, eclipsing the previous Hurricanes, Katrina or Sandy. The devastating storm also had an adverse impact on the plastics industry as the Gulf Coast is the epicenter of the U.S. specialty chemicals and petrochemicals industry that provide the building blocks for plastic products. Harvey Crippled the Foundation of Packaging Industry Texas accounts for about 70% of U.S. production of ethylene — one of the most important chemicals used for producing plastics. Ethylene is a basic ingredient for final products ranging from plastic bottles to tires to polyester fabric. Industrial ethylene is derived from petroleum or natural gas, and many chemical plants producing ethylene are located near the Gulf Coast’s concentration of petroleum facilities. Hurricane Harvey has led to the shutdown of around 37% of U.S. production capacity for ethylene, which includes 55% of capacity in Texas. Producers such as The Dow Chemical Company , ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report), Chevron Phillips Chemical, among others have shut or cut back ethylene production. These disruptions have affected 37% of U.S. capacity for making chlorine and caustic soda, salt-derived chemicals used to make vinyl and PVC pipe. Consequently, a critical part of the supply chain for the industry has been paralyzed with petrochemical plants not in operation and the rail companies that ship them still restoring service. This situation has led to supply shortages and consequently higher prices for U.S. manufacturers. Raw Material Supply at Stake, Costs To RiseIt will likely take months to resume normalcy. In the meantime, prices for raw materials for plastics are already beginning to rise. The more material impact for the plastic packagers from Harvey will be on resin prices, since the Gulf supplies around 70-75% of the resin in the United States. This could weigh on earnings for the plastic stocks in the next few quarters. In line with this, Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) trimmed earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressures due to low resins’ supply. Nearly all of Newell’s resin suppliers with facilities in Texas and Louisiana have declared force majeure, with many facilities shut for more than a week and some still not operating. The company expects the impact to persist through fourth-quarter 2017 as well as resin inflation to build through the remainder of 2017 and in to 2018. Likewise, Greif, Inc. (GEF  -  Free Report) slashed fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to factor in $2.5-million headwind impact related to Hurricane Harvey. Performance and Zacks Industry RankYear to date, the Zacks Containers – Paper and Packaging industry has underperformed the S&P 500.

276,LYB,"The chemical industry continues its positive run this year on the back of healthy demand across automotive and construction end-markets, a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy market supported by a rebound in oil prices and an upturn in the world economy.Moreover, President Trump’s business-friendly tax reform contributed to the impressive earnings performance of the U.S. chemical companies in the first quarter. It is likely to remain a major tailwind as the reforms are expected to boost their bottom line, improve cash flow and incentivize capital investments.How Things Are Shaping Up in the Industry?Strong Demand in Major Markets: Chemical makers continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors – major chemical end-use markets. The underlying trends in the housing space remain healthy, backed by strong economic growth, steady buyer demand, declining mortgage rates, high homebuilders’ confidence and strong job market scenario.The automotive sector also continues its good run amid certain challenges, supported by an improving job market, rising personal income, favorable credit conditions, improved consumer confidence and impressive vehicle launches.A Rebound in Energy: Improving fundamentals in the energy space — a key market for chemicals — has been a major tailwind for the chemical industry. A recovery in crude oil prices has led to an increase in demand for chemicals in the energy market and a favorable pricing environment for chemical products. This is because chemical and oil prices move in tandem.Higher Production to Drive Growth in U.S. Chemical: The U.S. chemical industry is expected to witness strong gains in the production of agricultural chemicals, consumer products, coatings and bulk petrochemicals this year, per the industry trade group — American Chemistry Council (ACC). The trade group expects a strong growth in several chemical sectors in including fertilizers, petrochemicals, crop protection, coatings and consumer products. The ACC envisions national chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.4% in 2018.Moreover, the group expects continued expansion in production across the United States this year, with the Gulf Coast region witnessing strongest gains. Moreover, growth in output is expected to be driven by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets as well as upturn in U.S. manufacturing. While the automotive sector is expected to remain at high levels, steady recovery in housing is likely to continue in 2018.Favorable Shale Gas Economics: The United States continues to be an attractive destination for chemical investment. The American chemical industry has the competitive advantage of accessing abundant supplies of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and shale gas. Economics of shale gas is driving strong capital investment in new chemical projects, which is driving growth in the U.S. chemical space.Improving Export Markets: The ACC expects strong export markets to bolster the U.S. chemical industry in 2018. It expects two-way trade between the United States and foreign partners to expand 6.2% year over year and reach $241 billion this year on the back of strong demand from overseas markets and domestic manufacturers downstream.How Dividend Paying Stocks Can Enrich Your PortfolioStocks with solid dividend yield and attractive growth prospects offer excellent choices for investors seeking to create a portfolio that performs well in a growing market and offers downside protection.Consistent dividend payouts underscore a company’s financial strength and stability.  Given the positive developments in the chemical space, it would be a prudent move for investors to add some top-quality dividend stocks in their portfolio.We have employed the Zacks Stocks Screener to find four top chemical companies that offer a decent dividend yield and sport a favorable Zacks Rank.

The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth of 15%, above the industry average of 9.7%.Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.  What’s Driving MEOH?Forecast-topping earnings performance in the last reported quarter and strong demand fundamentals for methanol have contributed to the rally in Methanex’s shares.Methanex’s net profit (attributable to shareholders) increased nearly three-folds year over year in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings of $1.70 per share also trounced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.1%.Methanex is poised to gain from healthy demand fundamentals for methanol, which has been driven by both traditional derivatives and energy-related applications in Asia, particularly in China.Moreover, higher methanol prices should also boost its margins. Last year, the company’s average realized prices for methanol jumped roughly 39% year over year, while the same rose 26% in the fourth quarter. Methanex noted that methanol prices improved in the fourth quarter and into the early 2018, supported by methanol supply challenges and healthy demand.  Sequentially, the company expects higher average methanol prices in first-quarter 2018.Meanwhile, the company’s Chile IV plant is progressing with its restart process and is expected to be complete by third-quarter 2018.

280,LYB,"PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) has declared price increases for protective and marine coatings products globally. The price hike is effective immediately or as contracts permit.  The move comes after the company experienced broad inflation across a number of raw material categories. There has also been a steep rise in freight and logistics costs primarily due to increasing oil prices. Also. the company has been unable to fully offset its supply chain related inflation solely by ongoing productivity improvements and cost-saving initiatives.  This price hike will help mitigate rising raw material and operating costs experienced by the company. Products that have incurred the most significant increases include epoxy resins, zinc powders, titanium dioxide and solvents. The company sees healthy growth in target segments for its protective and marine coatings solutions. With the price hike, the company will be able to further invest in its operations to meet increasing customer demand. Shares of the company have moved up around 3.4% over a year, underperforming the roughly 7.9% growth recorded by its industry.    To improve cost structure, PPG Industries is pursuing significant restructuring actions that are mainly focused on regions and end-use markets with the weakest business conditions. The restructuring activities are projected to deliver around $125 million in annual savings with roughly $50 million of savings already realized in 2017 and another $45-$50 million expected in 2018. During the fourth-quarter call, PPG Industries stated that it is committed toward deploying at least $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of its earlier communicated goal of deploying $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. PPG Industries is also implementing appropriate pricing strategies to offset the impact of raw materials cost inflation.

281,LYB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, LyondellBasell Industries has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.1. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts LyondellBasell Industries’ current PE ratio equivalent to its midpoint (which is 9.9) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.4. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that LyondellBasell Industries has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for LyondellBasell Industries’ stock in the near term too.   P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, LyondellBasell Industries has a P/S ratio of about 1.2. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, LyondellBasell Industries currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes LYB a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for LyondellBasell Industries is just 1.0, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.4. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 7.5, which is somewhat better than the industry average of 9.9. Clearly, LYB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though LyondellBasell Industries might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B. This gives LYB a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The full-year 2018 has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days, compared to none lower, while the full-year 2019 estimate has seen three upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the full-year 2018 consensus estimate has nudged up nearly 1.2% in the past two months, while the full-year 2019 estimate has risen about 2.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Price and Consensus  LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Price and Consensus | LyondellBasell Industries N.V. QuoteThis somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.  Bottom LineLyondellBasell Industries is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Boasting a good industry rank (top 19% out of more than 250 industries) and a strong Zacks Rank, the company deserves attention right now. In fact, over the past two years, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

282,LYB,"LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report) has been struggling lately, but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon. That is because LYB recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom.What is a Hammer Chart Pattern? A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting. The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day, but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price. This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Other FactorsPlus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 6 estimates have gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon. This will be especially true if LYB stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development.

283,LYB,"The Dow emerged from four straight sessions of losses to finish in the green on Monday. The ascent was largely attributable to a reduction in fears triggered off by President Trump’s recent tariff announcements. Key members of his administration remained evasive over the likelihood of such plans actually reaching fruition. Additionally, leading Republicans strongly voiced their opposition to such a move.Meanwhile, a section of analysts have questioned whether such tariffs will actually come into force. They have repeatedly pointed at Trump’s own tweets on the issue, where he more or less indicates that this could merely be a bargaining tactic to gain leverage ahead of future NAFTA negotiations.Also, Trump has been extremely sensitive to market movements, taking credit for equity gains on more than one occasion. This is why he is also likely to take further market losses caused by his remarks into account before taking the final call on the issue. Taking these factors into account, stocks could soon begin racking up steady gains. This is why it makes sense to pick up great value stocks while the situation remains volatile.GOP Leaders Critical of Tariffs, White House EvasiveHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was among the leading GOP leader to voice his resentment on the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan said the Speaker was “extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war.” Strong added that Ryan was “urging the White House to not advance with this plan” since it could “jeopardize” the economic benefits reaped from recent tax cuts.Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross remained largely evasive when questioned during a television interview as to whether Trump would actually go ahead with the proposed tariffs. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also provided inconsistent responses on the issue, giving the impression that the tariffs were far from a done deal.Tariffs Only a Negotiating Tactic?The President himself indicated that the decision to actually go ahead with the tariffs was contingent on the amount of headway made on NAFTA negotiations. Trump suggested that fresh terms from Mexico and Canada could exempt these countries from the import taxes. On Monday, the President tweeted that “Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed.""A significant section of analysts also felt that the trade tariff impasse could end with a diplomatic solution. They pointed toward the fact that Caterpillar (CAT) and Harley-Davidson (HOG) gained 3.2% and 2.3% on Monday. Both these stocks are expected to be hugely be impacted by these import taxes. Traders also felt that Trump’s NAFTA related comments showed that he was ready to adopt a flexible approach.Targeted, Muted Response LikelyOver the weekend, Trump had argued that trade wars may actually be good for the U.S. economy. But on Monday he changed tack, saying: “I don’t think we’ll have a trade war.” Trump’s rationale throughout this episode has been that the United States is too large a market to ignore or rile up beyond a certain point. And given the initial response of the countries likely to be most affected by his tariffs, this seems to be largely true as of now.Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Trump on Monday to say that tariffs could only impede NAFTA stocks further. Canada and Mexico have threatened to retaliate, but only in a targeted fashion.Meanwhile, the EU has said that it will impose tariffs on classic American products such as bourbon, jeans and Harley motorcycle, but doesn’t seem keen on further measures at this point. China has asked Trump to be cautious on the issue but has stopped short of specific trade-related measures.Our ChoicesTrump’s NAFTA related comments show that the President is yet to make up his mind on tariff related announcements. Meanwhile, though Trump has received some bipartisan support on the issue, the GOP remains largely opposed to the idea. More importantly, countries that will be severely impacted by such tariffs have largely issued a targeted and muted response.These developments suggest that fears surrounding a tariff war may be largely overstated. Hence it makes sense to buy value stocks in the interim that that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes in earnest.

288,LYB,"Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this chemical company an attractive investment option.What’s Working in Favor of EMN?An Outperformer: Eastman Chemical, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has outperformed the industry it belongs to over the last three months. The company’s shares have gained around 21.2% over this period, compared with roughly 2.7% gain recorded by the industry.Forecast-topping earnings performance in the last reported quarter and a buoyant outlook for 2018 have contributed to a rally in Eastman Chemical’s shares.

295,LYB,"Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (ASH  -  Free Report) will increase prices of 1-4 butanediol (BDO) and several derivative products in the Americas. The price hike will be effective from Apr 1, 2018 or as contracts permit.  The company will raise the price of 1-4 butanediol (BDO) by 10 cents per pound or 22 cents per kg. Prices of BLO butylrolactone, n-methyl-pyrrolidone, tetrahydrofuran, n-hydroxyethyl-2-pyrrolidone, n-ethyl-2-pyrrolidone, 2-pyrrolidone, n-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone and specialty solvents will increase by 15 cents per pound or 33 cents per kg, each. Ashland is taking appropriate pricing actions in response to raw material cost inflation. The latest move follows a series of price increases announced last month.  Shares of Ashland have moved up 13.7% over the past six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s 0.1% upside.    Ashland missed earnings and sales estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017). In the quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings came in at 46 cents per share, trailing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. Revenues increased roughly 19.6% year over year to $842 million. The figure, however, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $860 million. For fiscal 2018, Ashland updated its adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $2.90-$3.10 per share owing to changes in the company’s effective tax rate. Also, the company raised its effective tax rate expectation for the fiscal as a result of the recently enacted tax reform. This, in turn, is expected to reduce fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings by roughly 30 cents per share. For second-quarter fiscal 2018, Ashland projects adjusted earnings in the range of 80-90 cents per share compared with 70 cents in the prior-year period. The company expects the benefit of its pricing actions to be partly offset, in the fiscal second quarter, by the impact of the planned maintenance shutdown in the Marl, Germany, facility. Ashland Global Holdings Inc.

297,LYB,"Shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) have rallied 23.1% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of roughly 11.2%. Freeport, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, has a market cap of roughly $25.7 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months was around 19,502.8K.  Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this mining company.Driving FactorsForecast-topping fourth-quarter 2017 earnings performance, progress in exploration activities to expand production capacity and efforts to reduce debt have contributed to the rally in Freeport’s shares.The company’s reported net income (attributable to common stock) jumped more than three-folds to 71 cents per share in the fourth quarter from 21 cents recorded a year ago. Adjusted earnings of 51 cents a share also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents.Freeport’s results benefited from improving market conditions for copper, its focus on productivity along with cost and capital discipline. The company generated strong cash flows and continued to strengthen its balance sheet along with advancing several long-term projects.For 2018, Freeport believes that its shareholders are well positioned to benefit from its global leadership position in copper, high-quality portfolio of geographically diverse assets and favorable copper market conditions.The company anticipates consolidated sales volumes for 2018 to be roughly 3.9 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold and 91 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1 billion pounds of copper, 675,000 ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum for first-quarter 2018.Freeport is conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus to expand reserves that will support additional future production capacity.Freeport’s actions to reduce debt should also boost its financial position. It has efficiently achieved its debt reduction objectives during 2016 and 2017 while retaining robust asset base for the future. During fourth-quarter 2017, the company repaid $1.7 billion debt and its total debt has also declined around 18.2% year over year to $13.1 billion at the end of 2017.Recently, Freeport issued notices to redeem $454 million total principal amount of Freeport and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas LLC senior notes on Apr 4. The move will result in total cash interest cost savings worth $30 million per year.  Also, last month, Freeport’s board reinstated a cash dividend on its common stock and plans to declare a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share and expects an initial quarterly dividend to be paid on May 1. The move reflects Freeport’s execution of its plan to strengthen its financial position over the last two years. It is also driven by improved market conditions and a positive outlook for generating strong cash flows.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Price and Consensus Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

299,LYB,"Fertilizer maker, CF Industries Holdings, Inc.’s (CF  -  Free Report) stock looks promising at the moment. We are positive on the company’s prospects and believe that the time is right for you to add the stock to portfolio as it looks promising and is poised to carry the momentum ahead.Let’s delve deeper into the factors that make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock an intriguing choice for investors right now.What’s Working in Favor of CF?An Outperformer: CF Industries has outperformed the industry over a year. The company’s shares have rallied around 23.6% over this period, compared with roughly 4.9% gain recorded by the industry. Estimates Northbound: Annual earnings estimates for CF Industries have moved north over the past month, reflecting analysts’ confidence on the stock. Over this period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has shot up 63.6% to 90 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 has also increased 36.6% to $1.53 per share.Positive Earnings Surprise History: CF Industries has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 72.9%.Solid Growth Prospects: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2018 for CF Industries is currently pegged 90 cents, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of a staggering 460%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register a 69.8% growth in 2019.Growth Drivers in Place: CF Industries benefits from higher nitrogen demand driven by healthy corn plantations and cyclical recovery in the nitrogen fertilizer industry. The company expects India and Brazil to be major drivers for urea demand in 2018. Based on the company’s analysis and published reports, India is expected to require the import of 500,000-1,000,000 metric tons of urea prior to end of March to meet its fertilizer requirements for this year.Brazil also imported roughly 5.4 million metric tons of urea in 2017, up 15% year over year, and has emerged as a major importer of the nutrient. Import demand is also expected to be healthy in North America in 2018.Moreover, CF Industries should benefit from higher prices of nitrogen fertilizers. Higher selling prices drove the company’s sales in the last reported quarter. Tighter global nitrogen supply and demand balance supported nitrogen prices in the quarter. The company expects higher energy costs in major producing regions, lower production in China, a weaker U.S. dollar, increased oil and freight costs and a steady global demand to support nitrogen prices during first-half 2018 at levels higher than the comparable period a year ago.CF Industries should also gain from its efforts to boost production capacity. The company completed a new 400,000-ton urea equivalent per year DEF unit at the Donaldsonville complex in 2017 to support the growth of its diesel fluid business.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

301,LYB,"Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (ASH  -  Free Report) will increase prices of 1-4 butanediol and derivatives in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). The price hike will be effective immediately or as contracts permit.The company will increase the prices of 1-4 butanediol (BDO) by €100/MT and for derivatives (including THF, NMP, BLO, 2-Pyrol) up to €200/MT.Ashland noted that the price increase reflects evolving market conditions and will help it to continue to serve its customers with the premium level services. The latest move follows a series of price increases announced by the company in the recent past.Ashland is also taking appropriate pricing actions in response to raw material cost inflation. The company, earlier this month, announced price increase on epoxy vinyl ester and specialty resins in North America, effective from Apr 1, 2018. The move is driven by sustained rise in the costs of major raw materials.Shares of Ashland have declined 44.6% over a year, significantly underperforming the industry’s 8.7% gain.  Ashland’s earnings and sales missed estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017). In the quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings came in at 46 cents per share, trailing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. Revenues increased roughly 19.6% year over year to $842 million in the quarter. The figure, however, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $860 million. For fiscal 2018, Ashland updated its adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $2.90-$3.10 per share owing to changes in the company’s effective tax rate. Also, the company raised effective tax rate expectation for the fiscal as a result of the recently enacted tax reform. This, in turn, is expected to reduce fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings by roughly 30 cents per share. For second-quarter fiscal 2018, Ashland projects adjusted earnings in the range of 80-90 cents per share compared with 70 cents in the prior-year period. The company expects the benefit of pricing actions to be partly offset in the quarter by the impact of the planned maintenance shutdown in the Marl, Germany, facility.Ashland Global Holdings Inc.

302,LYB,"Investors have been on the edge since Trump’s tariff talks had sparked trade war fears between the United States and China. As tensions gradually eased with both sides practicing restraint, the market took a breather and recovered from the early jolt when the news had first gone public.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that rake in higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screen:Facebook, Inc.

The company has an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 8%.  Let’s take a look into the factors that are driving this steel company.Driving FactorsBetter-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 earnings performance, upbeat outlook and efforts to improve its operations and cost structure have contributed to the rally in U.S. Steel’s shares.U.S. Steel swung to a profit in the fourth quarter of 2017, helped by benefits from the investments in its assets. It reported net earnings of $159 million or 90 cents per share in the quarter against net loss of $105 million or 61 cents recorded a year ago. Adjusted earnings of 76 cents per share trounced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 68 cents.Recently, U.S. Steel updated its full-year 2018 guidance. For the year, the company now expects EBITDA of roughly $1.7 billion (up from roughly $1.5 billion expected earlier), considering the potential market conditions resulting from the Section 232 actions and increased shipments from Granite City Works. It expects EBITDA to be roughly $250 million for the first quarter.U.S. Steel stated that the revised guidance considers two factors, namely, the market dynamics related to President Trump’s decision to impose 25% tariff on steel imports and the recently announced restarting of one of the two blast furnaces and steelmaking facilities at Granite City Works.U.S. Steel is actively engaged in improving its cost structure and operations on a sustainable basis through its “Carnegie Way” initiative that includes actions such as manufacturing process/logistics improvements and savings on SG&A costs. The company realized Carnegie Way benefits of $491 million for full-year 2017, mostly in its Flat-Rolled division. These actions are also expected to deliver meaningful benefits in 2018.Notably, the company is witnessing healthy demand in the automotive space. In September last year, U.S. Steel and Japan’s Kobe Steel agreed to start construction of a new continuous galvanizing line at their subsidiaries’ joint venture, Pro-Tec Coating Company.The move is in response to growing demand for advanced high-strength steels. The new line, involving an investment of around $400 million, will help automakers make economically lightweight vehicles to meet increasing fuel efficiency requirements and maintain high safety standards.United States Steel Corporation Price and Consensus United States Steel Corporation Price and Consensus | United States Steel Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering in the basic materials space are LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth of around 12%, just above the industry average of 11.8%.Let's take a look into the factors that are driving this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. What’s Driving STLD?Forecast-topping earnings performance in the last reported quarter, upbeat outlook and the Trump administration’s trade actions on imported steel have contributed to the rally in Steel Dynamics' shares.Steel Dynamics topped earnings and revenue expectations in fourth-quarter 2017. Its adjusted earnings of 54 cents per share for the quarter trounced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents, translating into a 10.2% positive earnings surprise.Steel Dynamics, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects steel consumption in the automotive market in North America to be steady and the company continues to gain momentum in that space. It also sees sustained additional growth across the construction and energy sectors. The company also noted that it expects the recent tax reform to provide an impetus for additional domestic fixed asset investment and growth.Steel Dynamics, last month, provided earnings guidance for first-quarter 2018. The company expects earnings to be between 88 cents and 92 cents per share for the quarter. Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings are expected to be higher than 54 cents per share in the previous quarter and 82 cents a year ago.The company expects profitability from its steel operations to improve sequentially backed by higher shipments and metal spread expansion. Also, pricing of average quarterly steel products is expected to increase more than scrap costs. This is because prices of steel across the platform have been improving throughout the quarter aided by strong steel demand in domestic market.Moreover, Steel Dynamics expects this improving steel consumption and pricing momentum to continue during the year supported by strong steel demand fundamentals and customer optimism. The company also believes the recent steel trade actions taken by the U.S. Federal Administration are likely to reduce imports.The Trump administration has slapped a 25% tariff on steel imports aimed at protecting the U.S. steel industry which had long been struggling to cope with an influx of cheap imports. The tariffs are expected to lead to lower imports into the United States, which would in turn boost demand for American steel and drive profitability of U.S. steel makers. The tariffs would also provide a boost to steel prices and give American steel makers more pricing power.Steel Dynamics, Inc. Price and Consensus  Steel Dynamics, Inc.

318,LYB,"With Jay Powell now at the helm of the Federal Reserve instead of Janet Yellen, focus has shifted to how interest rates are likely to change in the imminent future given a healthy economic scenario buoyed by reduced taxes and increased federal spending. As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that rake in higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for Screening In order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 21 stocks that qualified the screen:CBRE Group, Inc. : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Valmont Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Valmont Industries, Inc. Quote Segment Review Broadly, the Omaha, NE-based company classifies its business segments as infrastructure- and agriculture-related. Infrastructure-Related Engineered Support Structures: The segment’s sales of $250.1 million were 2.4% higher than the prior-year quarter owing to higher highway safety product sales in Australia, partly neutralized by lower sales of lighting, traffic and wireless communication structures globally. Utility Support Structures: Sales rose 14% year over year to $243.4 million on the back of continued strong demand in North America and price recovery of higher steel costs.  Coatings: This segment recorded year over year net sales growth of 10% to $83 million. This was mainly driven by increased sales to other Valmont segments, improving market conditions in Australia and pricing to recover higher zinc cost. Agriculture-Related Irrigation: The segment reported net sales of $149.5 million, up 9% year over year due to project activity and demand in key overseas markets. Sales in the North America were comparable year over year. Financial Position Valmont ended fourth-quarter 2017 with cash balance of $492.8 million, up roughly 23.2% year over year. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $753.9 million, down around 0.1% year over year. Outlook Valmont expects adjusted earnings for 2018 to be around $8.00 per share. This doesnot include any the impacts of the 2018 Restructuring Plan and any impacts from the sale of the grinding media business or potential acquisitions.  The company expects revenues to grow 7% in 2018(barring the impact of grinding media business sale and potential acquisitions). Raw material cost inflation is likely to continue throughout the year which will be offset by pricing actions, cost reductions, and productivity improvements. Foreign currency translation might have a favorable impact.  The company expects to witness modest growth for the Engineered Support Structures and Coatings segments while continued good market conditions support a favorable outlook for the utility business. As for the irrigation segment, growth is anticipated on the back of international markets with modest growth in North America. Price Performance Valmont’s shares have lost around 8.8% over the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 6.1% gain.    Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Valmont currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Methanex Corporation (MEOH  -  Free Report), LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

The company realized cost improvement and transaction synergies related to the Arizona Chemical acquisition of $65 million at the end of September 2017, well ahead of its initial year-end 2018 target.Moreover, Kraton remains committed to steer organic growth in key markets through state-of-the-art innovation and infrastructure. The company, in May 2017, announced the opening of a hydrogenated styrenic block copolymer (“HSBC”) plant in Mailiao, Taiwan. The plant will boost the company’s innovation-grade business, especially low molecular weight HSBC products. It will also help Kraton to effectively serve the growing export and Asian markets through higher production capacity of varied grades of HSBC products.Kraton should also gain from its efforts to reduce debt.

330,LYB,"The world’s stock markets are open for trading. Traders are looking for cues to an overall direction after a swift week-long correction hit.The history of corrections shows: There is usually more price action pain before any enduring gain.We have seen the “It’s Still a Bull Market” optimists “buy the dip.” That may mean traders have to grind prices down to wring out that excess optimism before stock markets move higher… in an enduring manner. Traders in corrections usually need to see capitulation. We haven’t seen that — at all.For this Global Week Ahead, let’s look into Reuters' five biggest world market themes.(1) A Key to Rates: the U.S. Consumer Price Inflation Reading on DeckWhether world markets settle down now — or suffer a fresh volatility shockwave — may be determined by this week’s consumer and producer price inflation readings in the United States.They are expected to show U.S. consumer prices rising at the +2.1% year-on-year rate they grew at in December. But any stronger and it would feed bets on faster Fed rate hikes, potentially triggering another dump in stocks and bonds. Don’t forget: this whole blowout whipped up after Feb 2nd U.S. jobs data showed the strongest year-on-year wage growth since 2009.If U.S. inflation does accelerate, markets could see Treasury yields get above the 3.0% level that several investment banks had set as their year-end target.U.S. inflation is not the only game in town, though. British January data (due Tuesday) will be in focus after the Bank of England’s recent hawkish comments. Finally, we get German numbers (Wednesday). These should show price growth still subdued, though wage deals and a new coalition government will likely lift future inflation.(2) The Return of Market VolatilityMarket volatility is back. With a bang. After months anchored at historically low levels, U.S. stock market volatility exploded last week. The rise in the VIX index on Tuesday was the biggest in its history.Trillions of dollars were wiped off of global equity market cap and, according to Goldman Sachs, Wall Street’s near -10% drawdown was steeper and faster than the historical average of all corrections and bear markets going back to the Second World War.Have we now moved to a “high vol” regime from a “low vol” regime, and will equity volatility serious infect other markets? Investors will be seeking clues.Above 30, the VIX is on track for its highest weekly close in over six years. Investors will want to see that come down to 20 or lower, while so far at least, contagion to FX, rates and credit markets has been limited. That may change if the VIX stays where it is.(3) Can European Earnings Reports Get the Bulls Excited?Another heavy week coming up on the European earnings front and with the recent volume jitters wiping 0.8 trillion euros from the region’s stocks, company updates are going to be key if there is any chance of the bulls coming back.So, will the results stem a downward trend in forecasts? Recent weeks have seen analysts’ predictions for fourth-quarter STOXX 600 earnings downgraded to 11%, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, from 18 percent a few weeks ago.What’s more, the earnings “beats” in Europe are currently 48.2% — compare that to 78% for the S&P 500 index. In Europe, “beat” levels in an average quarter run at 50%.Companies due to report this week include: Heineken, Keurig, Credit Suisse, Enel, Airbus, Nestle, Allianz, Renault and Eni.One saving grace is that recent selloff has cheapened share valuations. So, in theory at least, that takes some pressure off those that fall short of expectations. In the end, though, it might just be the moves of the might S&P 500 and Dow across the pond that have the most influence on proceedings.(4) China’s New Year StartsIt’s a tradition Chinese authorities are keeping alive even at a time when they are cracking down heavily to try and wean the economy off debt: keeping the money markets amply supplied and stable during the week-long Chinese new year holidays.Even though the People’s Bank of China has refrained from injecting cash through money market operations for nearly two weeks, repo rates are soft and interbank funding has been smooth.It is expected to stay that way next week even as consumers and companies withdraw huge amounts of cash to spend and distribute over Chinese New Year — and banks fund their books for the Feb 15 - 21 holiday week.That is partly because of some longer tenor repos the central bank did at the beginning of the year and a generous cut made to some banks’ cash reserve ratios which has given them more room to play with.Longer-term Chinese government bond yields are down too since January, and haven’t kept pace with the rise in yields elsewhere in the Western world. Analysts suspect that is deliberate from Beijing, to keep Chinese markets insulated from a global bout of monetary tightening.Red packets are traditionally given at Chinese New Year to symbolize good luck and ward off evil spirits. This could be the PBOC’s gift.(5) Submerging Markets Now?Emerging market shares may have shared the pain, but bonds and currencies have outperformed for the most past during the global February freak-out, leaving investors wondering how long this traditional volatile asset class can keep it up.EM dollar debt spreads — the premiums investors demand to hold these bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries — have been rising but not earthshaking, and they are still lower on average than at any point in 2015, 2016 and 2017.That is probably due to the sleepy dollar as much as anything, but if it gets shaken awake or global markets take another serious lurch, the resistance could be broken.One of the long-running EM issues — Jacob Zuma’s departure from South Africa’s Presidency could also come to a head, while another hotspot, Turkey, will publish its latest inflation numbers. It has been rising fast and the central bank wants it down. The catch is the government doesn’t want interest rates to go up.Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks(1) Boeing (BA  -  Free Report): When one looks into the rise in the DJIA, a lot is attributed to this 198 billion market-cap stock.

333,LYB,"A deadlock to pass the budget deal in the U.S. Senate led to a federal shutdown at midnight on Feb 8 with Senator Rand Paul repeatedly stalling proceedings. This brought into the fore partisan division and continued bickering within both the parties, closing non-essential government operations for the second time in less than a month.  As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 26 stocks that qualified the screen:CBRE Group, Inc. : Headquartered in Los Angeles, CBRE Group is a commercial real estate services and investment firm.

335,LYB,"Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report)  issued an update on the Pascua-Lama project status. The project is located on the Chile-Argentina border.  In January 2017, Barrick reported that the existing infrastructure on the Chilean side of the Pascua-Lama project was ordered to be closed by Chile’s Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente (“SMA”). The order was part of a re-evaluation process, ordered by Chile’s Environmental Court in 2014 in regard to historical compliance issues.  The company is appealing against the resolution on various grounds. Barrick maintained that the resolution does not affect its ongoing evaluation of an underground, block-caving operation at Pascua-Lama that will require additional regulatory and permitting approvals in both Chile and Argentina, irrespective of the recent SMA decision.In response to the closure order of the surface facilities in Chile by the SMA and current plans to assess an underground mine, Barrick is reclassifying the project’s proven and probable gold reserves of roughly 14 million ounces. The company expects to incur an estimated pretax impairment of $429 million at Pascua-Lama in the fourth quarter of 2017.According to Barrick, a shift to an underground operation will address community concerns considerably by reducing the overall environmental impacts of the project when compared with an open pit operation. Additionally, underground operations are less susceptible to weather-related production impacts during the winter season.Barrick and Shandong Gold also formed a working group to study a potential partnership at Pascua-Lama, building on their existing joint venture at the adjacent Veladero mine.Shares of Barrick fell 3.6% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 2.8% decline.  Last month, Barrick declared preliminary production results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. The company stated that preliminary full-year gold production of 5.32 million ounces for 2017 came in line with its adjusted guidance range of 5.30-5.50 million ounces. Gold production for the fourth quarter was 1.34 million ounces. The company’s preliminary full-year and fourth-quarter gold sales were 5.30 million ounces and 1.37 million ounces, respectively.

343,LYB,"Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report), a global leader in multi-material, precision engineered products and solutions for a variety of industries, is slated to release its fourth-quarter 2017 results before the bell on Feb 5.Arconic saw lower profits in the third quarter of 2017, hurt by costs related to higher aluminum prices. Adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share for the quarter lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents.Revenues rose around 3% year over year to $3,236 million in the third quarter, driven by improved volumes across all segments. Sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,129 million.Arconic’s shares have gained around 19.3% over a year, modestly outperforming the roughly 18.7% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayArconic, in October 2017, reaffirmed its full-year 2017 adjusted earnings guidance of $1.15-$1.20 per share. However, the company updated its revenue and capital expenditure outlook for 2017.The company raised its revenue expectations for 2017 to the range of $12.6-$12.8 billion from $12.3-$12.7 billion expected earlier. Arconic also revised its capital expenditure forecast for the year to roughly $600 million from its prior view of up to $650 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Arconic for the fourth quarter stands at $3,070 million, reflecting a year over year growth of 3.5%.Arconic is focusing on cost reduction and productivity improvements across its businesses, which should lend support to its bottom line in the fourth quarter. The company achieved net cost saving of 1.5% of revenues in the last reported quarter and is expected to continue to benefit in the December quarter.In particular, the company expects its selling, general administrative, and other expenses (SG&A) to be lower by around $40 million in the December quarter. For the full year, the company sees a $100 million year over year reduction in SG&A.Arconic is also seeing healthy demand trends in the aerospace market and is actively pursuing its aerospace expansion strategy. It is well placed to gain from major contract wins in aerospace. Arconic is witnessing strong momentum in commercial aero engines with sales rising 9% year over year in the third quarter.  The company expects commercial aero engine revenues to be up 5% in the fourth quarter on a sequential comparison basis.However, Arconic faces headwind from charges associated with higher aluminum prices, driven by LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting, increased processing costs and metal lag. Charges of around $60 million hurt Arconic's profits in the third quarter and remain a headwind in the fourth, albeit to a lesser extent. The company sees an unfavorable impact of around $90 million from these charges (LIFO and metal lag) for 2017. Arconic, in December 2017, said that it is divesting its Latin America Extrusions (LAE) business, a part of its Transportation and Construction Solutions segment. The divestment of the LAE business is part of the company’s sustained initiatives to streamline its business portfolio, focus on its higher-margin products, reduce complexity and drive profitable growth.Arconic noted that the ownership of the business will be transferred to a subsidiary of Hydro Extruded Solutions AS following customary regulatory and anti-trust reviews. The transaction is expected to consummate in first-half 2018.Per the deal terms, Arconic will get roughly $10 million in cash for the LAE business, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The company will recognize a restructuring-related charge representing the loss on sale of roughly $40 million (post-tax) or 8 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017. The charge is mainly associated with the non-cash impairment of the net book value of the LAE business.Arconic Inc. Price and Consensus  Arconic Inc. Price and Consensus | Arconic Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Arconic is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Arconic is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 24 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Arconic currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.27% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +18.99% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

344,LYB,"LyondellBasell Industries (LYB  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Feb 2. The company’s adjusted earnings of $2.41 per share for the third quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43. However, revenues increased roughly 15.6% year over year to $8,516 million, beating the consensus mark of $8,090 million. LyondellBasell has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two with an average positive earnings surprise of 0.9%. In the past six months, shares of the company have gained 33.2%, outperforming the industry’s 18.3% rally. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider LyondellBasell, in its third-quarter call, noted that Hurricane Harvey led to reduced inventories across the petrochemical industry. This has resulted in further delays in the startup of new U.S. ethylene and derivative capacity. The company expects global markets to remain tight to balanced as the industry have worked to rebuild inventories during the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for LyondellBasell for the fourth quarter stands at $8,785 million, reflecting an expected year over year growth of 13.4%. Revenues for LyondellBasell’s Intermediates and Derivatives segment for the soon-to-be reported quarter is projected to witness a 5.1% rise from the previous quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $2,182 million.  At the Olefins & Polyolefins – Americas segment, revenues are expected to rise 4.3% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $2,554 million. On the contrary, revenues from the Olefins & Polyolefins – Europe, Asia, International division is expected to witness a 4.5% fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is projected at $3,011 million for the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Refining segment is pegged at $1,700 million for the fourth quarter. This reflects an estimated 1.8% increase on a sequential basis. The Technology segment sales are expected to rise 18.4% sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $116 million. The company is benefiting from the favorable North American natural gas environment. It is also executing its expansion projects to leverage the U.S. natural gas liquids advantage. The company’s expansion initiatives are likely to boost the capacity and add to its earnings. LyondellBasell is constructing a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast that will employ its proprietary Hyperzone PE technology. The facility is expected to have an annual capacity of 1.1 billion pounds.  Furthermore, the company has started production at its polypropylene (PP) compounding plant in Dalian, China. The 20 kiloton per year plant is the company’s third facility in China. It is strategically located to cater the country’s growing automotive market. In November, LyondellBasell entered into a definitive agreement to buy 50% interest in Quality Circular Polymers (QCP) — a high standard plastics recycling company located in Sittard-Geleen, Netherlands. Per the agreement, the company will be a 50/50 partner in QCP along with SUEZ — a French company specializing in waste and water management. The deal combines LyondellBasell's technical capabilities and European market presence with SUEZ's ability to collect and recover waste into new materials. It is likely to provide a strategic platform for sustainable growth. However, LyondellBasell faces headwind from Hurricane Harvey, which is expected to impact its fourth-quarter results. Hurricane Harvey adversely impacted the company’s nine major U.S. Gulf Coast sites during the previous quarter, which led to the shutdown of an ethylene cracker. The company’s La Porte ethylene cracker had an unplanned shutdown in the third quarter due to Hurricane Harvey, affecting production and sales volumes in the quarter. LyondellBasell sees lost sales and expenses from Harvey to impact its fourth-quarter 2017 results by roughly $100 million. The company also expects lost production due to an unplanned maintenance at its ethylene cracker to affect its fourth-quarter results by roughly $40 million. LyondellBasell Industries NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise LyondellBasell Industries NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | LyondellBasell Industries NV QuoteEarnings WhisperOur proven model conclusively shows that LyondellBasell is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Zacks ESP: LyondellBasell has an Earnings ESP of +0.55%.

Our back testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.Demand Strength Across Major End-MarketsChemical makers continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors – major chemical end-use markets. The underlying trends in the housing space remain healthy, backed by steady buyer demand, low mortgage rates, high homebuilders’ confidence, low unemployment levels and rising rent costs.The automotive sector also continues its good run amid certain challenges, supported by an improving job market, rising personal income, improved consumer confidence, low fuel prices, impressive vehicle launches and attractive financing options.A rebound in crude oil prices has also led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy space, an important end-use market. The recent uptrend in oil prices has been supported by a decline in U.S. oil stockpiles and extension of oil production cuts by OPEC and other major world producers until the end of 2018. The recovery in oil prices has also led to a favorable pricing environment for chemical products.Strategic Actions to Yield Margin BenefitsCost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should reap industry-wide margin improvements in Q4. Chemical companies also remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and perk up growth. Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings in the December quarter.  Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking appropriate pricing actions (reflected by hikes in chemical prices in the recent past) in the wake of a sharp rise in raw materials costs. This is also expected to support their margins in Q4.A Few ConcernsThe lingering effects of Hurricane Harvey pose a concern for U.S. chemical companies in Q4. Harvey weighed on U.S. chemical production during Q3, knocking off a sizable chunk of production capacity. A number of major chemical producers had to shutter or cut back ethylene production, leading to reduced supply of this major chemical. Some of these companies are also witnessing a spike in raw material prices, exacerbated by short supply due to hurricanes.The carry-over impacts of disruptions caused by Harvey (in the form of lost production volumes and costs related to the storm) may pose some earnings headwinds for U.S. chemical makers in Q4.Q4 Performance So FarThe Q4 earnings season has seen releases from 133 S&P 500 participants as of Jan 26, based on our latest report.  The picture so far is encouraging, with total earnings for these companies having increased 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher sales.As per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is under the broader Basic Materials sector. The Basic Materials sector is among the Zacks sectors that are expected to rack up the strongest gains in Q4. Overall Q4 earnings for the sector are projected to climb 30.4% while revenues are expected to spike 18.9%.How to Pick the Winners?Given the large number of players operating in the chemicals space, picking the right stocks is apparently not an easy task.

Earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03.Revenues rose around 8% year over year to $2,465 million in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,387 million. Eastman Chemical has outperformed the industry it belongs to over a year.

The company should gain from sustained growth of its high margins specialty products.Eastman Chemical remains focused on cost-cutting and productivity actions.

Prices of acetate tow remain weak, hurting the company’s Fibers unit.The company is also exposed to raw material pricing headwinds. Higher input costs are expected to contribute to lower earnings in the company’s chemical intermediates business in the fourth quarter compared with the third as reflected in the company’s guidance. Ethylene margins are also expected to be under pressure in the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, the company’s actions to increase selling prices of its products and reduce costs are expected to help it offset the impact of these headwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus  Eastman Chemical Company Price and Consensus | Eastman Chemical Company QuoteEarnings Whispers Our proven model shows that Eastman Chemical is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter.

348,LYB,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Jan 30.In the last quarter, the steel giant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.3% by posting adjusted earnings of 79 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents.Revenues increased roughly 20.5% year over year to $5,170.1 million in the third quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,276 million.Nucor beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one, with an average positive surprise of 9.9%.Shares of Nucor have moved up 16.9% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 18.9% growth.  Can the company surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLast month, Nucor provided its fourth-quarter 2017 guidance. The company expects earnings for the quarter in the range of 50-55 cents per share. This is a decrease from 79 cents per share recorded in the previous quarter and is comparable to 50 cents earned a year ago.Total sales for Nucor for the fourth quarter is projected to decline by roughly 4.1% from the third quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $4,960 million.Nucor believes that the overall market demand in fourth-quarter 2017 has been strong. However, expected earnings in the steel mills unit will be negatively impacted by margin compression owing to the surge of imports experienced in the summer of 2017. This pressure from imports along with weakness in plate steel has caused the company to lower fourth quarter earnings estimate for the steel mills segment. Nucor anticipates similar results for the steel products unit in the fourth quarter compared to third-quarter 2017.Nucor Steel Louisiana witnessed an unplanned outage during fourth-quarter 2017 and resumed operations early last month. However, this outage was shorter than the unplanned outages experienced during the last quarter. Owing to this, Nucor expect earnings of the raw materials unit in the fourth quarter to improve from the third.Nucor noted that the U.S. steel industry continues to be adversely affected by steel imports. However, the industry continues to combat unfair traded imports. The United States Department of Commerce, last year, has made several ruling imposing duties on additional steel products which are favorable for the domestic steel industry.  Notably, the automotive market continues to remain healthy and the company is increasing penetration of new automotive platforms. Nonresidential construction markets are stable at a level considerably below peak 2007 mark, while energy markets continue their recovery from the depressed levels experienced in late 2014 and 2015. Agriculture and heavy equipment are continuing to show signs of improvement and in general, Nucor is optimistic on expected overall industrial production in 2018.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nucor is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Nucor for the fourth quarter is -4.93%.

350,LYB,"Industrial gas producer and supplier Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25, before the market opens.In three of the last four quarters, the company’s earnings were better-than-expected and in line in one. Average earnings surprise was a positive 2.32%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.50 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.17%.In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 12.4% return, outperforming the gain of 6.6% recorded by the industry.Let us see how things are shaping up for Praxair prior to this earnings announcement. What’s Influencing Q4 Results?We believe that increasing application of industrial gases in manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, food and beverages, and metal fabrication industries is an advantage for Praxair. This, along with the company’s initiatives to improve its products and services, has helped it win many contracts over time. Exiting third-quarter 2017, the company had a solid backlog of $1.5 billion.In the fourth quarter, the company signed long-term agreements with BASF and Samsung to build and operate a new syngas processing plant and an air separation plant, respectively, for them. It has also won a long-term gas supply contract from GLOBALFOUNDRIES and Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation. We believe these contract wins will be beneficial for Praxair.In addition, we expect international diversification to increase Praxair’s profitability in the quarters ahead. Business in North America will get a boost from strengthening demand in various end markets while that in Asia will improve on the back of growing electronics end market and new project wins. In Europe, volume growth in food and beverage market will be advantageous. Praxair Surface Technologies business will benefit from the aerospace market.For the fourth quarter, Praxair expects earnings per share to be within $1.45-$1.50. Despite all the positives, earnings growth in the quarter will be partially offset by adverse impact of 2 cents from the hurricanes.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

Further, the company expects iron-ore cash cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the range of $55-$60 per long ton, which remain unchanged from previous expectations.  The company also projects sales production volume of 10.5 million metric tons for the Asia Pacific Iron Ore operation, which represents a decrease from the previous forecast owing to operational decisions. Additionally, the company increased expectations for iron-ore cash cost of goods sold and operating expenses in the range of $36-$41 per metric ton owing to unfavorable exchange rate movements and reduced production volumes. Moreover, the company's interest expense for 2017 has been reduced by $5 million to roughly $130 million as a result of the refinancing transaction in July, of which $20 million is expected to be non-cash. The company also maintained its full-year selling, general and administrative (SG&A) cost expectation of $110 million factoring in higher incentive compensation accruals and spending associated with the development of the hot briquetted iron (HBI) production plant. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter is $644.5 million, reflecting a year over year decrease of around 14.5%.  For the fourth quarter, revenues from product sales and services at Cleveland-Cliffs’ U.S. Iron Ore segment is projected to witness a 24.5% decrease from the preceding quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $451 million.  Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from product sales and services at the Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment is expected to be $142 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an estimated 39.2% increase.  Meanwhile, Cleveland-Cliffs remains focused on de-leveraging its balance sheet. Its net debt was roughly $1.4 billion at the end of the third quarter, down from around $2 billion at the end of the year-ago quarter. The company, in October, said that it expects to cut net debt to below $1 billion by end-2017. This would lead to a reduction in its annualized interest expense. However, Cleveland-Cliffs is exposed to pricing pressure. It faces headwind from lower expected iron ore pricing, which coupled with anticipated volume pressure, may weigh on its fourth-quarter results.Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.
