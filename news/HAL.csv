0,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) said Monday that stresses on the U.S. rail system made deliveries of sand used in hydraulic fracturing less predictable, but shale companies are finding a work-around.Sand delivery was a major issue for the oilfield service provider in Q1 due to rail stoppages as exploration and production companies favor sand over customized man-made ceramics in ""slickwater"" fracs that rely on high volumes of water.""The U.S. rail system is experiencing high demand driven by strong economic activity,"" CEO Jeff Miller said during a conference call with analysts. ""This is adding stress to rails.""But Miller thinks the solution to the sand logistics issue will be the increased use of local sand.High-quality northern white sand shipped out of Wisconsin has long been a favorite among shale producers, but they are now looking at brown sand produced by Texas mines nearer the bustling Permian Basin.Hydraulic fracturing, the process of pressuring up wells until the surrounding rock reservoirs collapse and surrender their oil, requires vast quantities of sand to prop open channels in the ruptured stone through which oil and gas flow to the well.Halliburton shares erased intraday losses to trade up 0.2% at 52.05 on the stock market today.Crude oil prices erased early losses to trade up 0.4% at $68.64 a barrel, holding at a three-year high Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1,HAL,"Taking a loss is an inevitable part of investing in stocks but not particularly enjoyable. After all, you don't enter a swing trade with the goal of losing money. It's easy to hesitate when it comes to selling. What if the stock comes right back after I sell? What if I just need to be patient? All sorts of questions can cause doubt and hesitation.But if you can train yourself to shrug off the discomfort, you will come out further ahead over time. Taking losses when they are small is a key factor of being a successful swing trader. It makes room for new stocks that could provide your portfolio new growth or protects your portfolio from small losses turning into big losses.Take Halliburton (HAL). The stock joined IBD's SwingTrader on Jan. 22, breaking out of a short handle from a yearlong cup with handle (1). Halliburton had many things going for it. It had just reported earnings that beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom line; oil industry groups were showing strength and the oil minister of Saudi Arabia was expressing interest in continuing a deal with Russia to reduce exports; and finally, the market continued its strong move and rallied as the government shutdown ended. We also had extra confidence in the sector coming off a successful trade in Diamondback Energy (FANG) that was good for 7.8% in 13 days.Despite the marks in its favor, Halliburton did not remain as a current trade for long. The price action gave an early warning signal on Jan. 23 after its gain of 2.6% withered to under 1% by the close (2). Large-cap group mates Schlumberger (SLB) and McDermott (MDR) also struggled on the day suggesting group weakness.Price action worsened over the next two days turning what was a 4% profit from our entry into a flat trade. Haliburton closed near its lows for the day for three days in a row and closed a hair below its 5-day moving average line. By Jan. 26, the market started to show weak action and Halliburton exited SwingTrader (3). With a half-hour left in the trading session, Halliburton was nearly 1% below its 5-day moving average line. We make our decisions around that time to give subscribers a chance to act before the close and in this case, we missed a quarter-percent rally that followed. That didn't amount to much as the stock dropped a few percentage points over the next couple of days (4).The trade showed a loss just under 0.2%. Hesitation would have only made the problem worse as the stock dropped over 5% the following week. As it stood, January's losing trades lost only 1% on average. Meanwhile, the gains averaged 5.5% for the month. And there were three times more winners than losers. Rather than bemoaning the losses, think of yourself as getting protection from further losses and one step closer to getting that next gain.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Swing Trading Strategies And LessonsCutting Losses Quickly Is Key To Long-Term Stock ProfitsKeeping Losses Small Is Critical To Portfolio Progress

9,HAL,"Schlumberger (SLB), the world's largest oilfield services company, beat fourth-quarter forecasts Friday and expects oil companies to start spending more, while a top oil watchdog predicted U.S. oil output could surge past Saudi Arabia and Russia this year.X The bullish signals in spending and production follow the Q3 reporting season three months ago, when shale producers emphasized spending discipline over production growth.But since then, oil prices hit three-year highs as shale producers have been cutting expenses, with many of them suddenly flush with cash after tax cuts.Citing third-party surveys, Schlumberger expects a 15%-20% increase in North American investments in 2018 and a 5% increase in international spending, the first growth in four years.Those years saw lower spending due to the slump in crude. That, plus output curbs from OPEC and its allies, has translated to a tighter market, easing the supply glut that had weighed on prices.""This means the oil market is now in balance and the previous oversupply discount is gradually being replaced by a market tightness premium, which makes us increasingly positive on the global outlook for our business,"" Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement.International markets are especially important to Schlumberger where management said it has four to five times the earnings power than in North American land operations.Shares closed up 0.1% at 76.43 on the stock market today after falling as much as 3% as U.S. crude prices dropped 0.9% to $63.37 a barrel.  Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said while Schlumberger's outlook comments were generally positive, markets may have been disappointed by lack of a dividend increase.Halliburton (HAL), which is scheduled to report Q4 results Monday and is more exposed to North America, rose 1.3% and Baker Hughes (BHGE), on tap for Wednesday, closed flat. Oil and gas equipment company National Oilwell Varco (NOV) rallied to close up 0.2%.

Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Schlumberger's adjusted earnings jumped 78% to 48 cents per share while revenue climbed 15% to $8.179 billion. Revenue from North America rose 59% to $2.81 billion during the quarter. Analysts were expecting EPS of 44 cents on revenue of $8.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.But Schlumberger took $2.7 billion in charges, with nearly $1 billion related to investments in Venezuela.The company also said it is exiting the marine and land seismic acquisition market, booked a $938 million charge on a Venezuelan investment, and signed a memorandum of understanding with Occidental Petroleum (OXY) for a five-year service project in New Mexico's Delaware basin for 700 wells.Also in a monthly report out Friday, the International Energy Agency raised its outlook for growth in U.S. oil production by 240,000 barrels a day to 1.35 million barrels, enough to top Saudi Arabia and Russia.""Relentless growth should see the U.S. hit historic highs above 10 million barrels a day (in production), overtaking Saudi Arabia and rivaling Russia during the course of 2018 — provided OPEC and non-OPEC restraints remain in place,"" the IEA said.In its own monthly report out Thursday, OPEC said U.S. shale producers lowered break-even costs between 2015 and 2017 but now service companies are raising rig and labor costs so break-even prices are rising.Despite increased costs, OPEC cited a JPMorgan report that found U.S. shale exploration and production companies could achieve ""decent rates of return"" at $60 per barrel even if costs rose by another 15%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalDividend Hikes, Largest IPO Ever Lead 5 Oil Stories To Watch This Year

14,HAL,"Schlumberger (SLB) is expected to report its first year-over-year revenue growth in nine quarters when it announces first-quarter results Friday, as the rebound in oil prices lifts drilling activity.But the energy sector's recovery has been uneven, and analysts expect the oilfield service provider's earnings to fall 37.5% to 25 cents per share, while revenue is seen rising 7% to $6.98 billion.""It's going to be a tale of two markets"" for Schlumberger international vs. U.S., said Kevin Simpson, managing director at Griffin Securities.In its international segment, which accounts for three-fourths of total revenue, Schlumberger is still likely seeing pricing pressure from larger Middle Eastern customers like government-run Saudi Aramco, which continue to demand discounts, he said.But international activity has hit its low point, Byron Pope, a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt, who also cautioned that investors should not expect a dramatic recovery any time soon.""The North American landscape cycles up and down faster than international activity,"" he said. ""It will take time before we see international oilfield activities perk up.""Meanwhile in the U.S., Schlumberger has seen a ""strong recovery"" for some of its more high-tech services like steerable drilling, Simpson said.But the company has been more cautious about jumping back into U.S. fracking than peers like Halliburton (HAL), so any guidance from management on how aggressively it will pursue the shale surge will be key.""Halliburton is accelerating their reactivation,"" Simpson said. ""Those costs are going to hurt near-term earnings, but I think is the right thing to do given the customer base in general has geared itself to be able to expand in a $50+ oil environment.""Schlumberger shares ticked up 3 cents to close at 76.51 on the stock market today, after hitting their lowest close since September on Wednesday as oil prices tumbled, and remain in a flat base with a 87.94 buy point.

15,HAL,"The U.S. economy added 98,000 jobs in March, as the jobless rate fell to 4.5%, the lowest since April 2007, the Labor Department reported on Friday.While Wall Street economists expected a 180,000-job gain, the tepid rise looks mostly like an effect of a record warm February followed by a Northeast snowstorm in mid-March. The bigger deal is the drop in the jobless rate, which Wall Street had expected to hold steady at 4.7%.The combination of a robust report on private hiring in March from payroll processor ADP, which estimated a 263,000 gain, and an extremely robust report on Friday from the household survey, suggests that the job market continues to be on a very firm footing.The payroll number comes from a survey of establishments, which — unlike the ADP report — can be thrown off by bad weather during the survey week. The unemployment rate comes from the household survey, which showed that the ranks of the employed rose by 472,000 last month after a 340,000 increase in February.Average hourly wages rose 0.2% to $26.14, matching the 0.2% increase expected. Hourly wages rose by 2.7% from a year ago, but that number looks like it could rise significantly by June. That's because March and April of 2016 saw the biggest wage gains last year, helped along by a big wage hike at Wal-Mart (WMT), so the comparison will be much easier by June.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite turned modestly lower on the stock market today immediately after its release but rallied to close mostly flat as markets looked past the disappointing headline number to the labor market's underlying strength. The 10-year Treasury yield, which was lower before the report on a safety bid after the overnight U.S. bombing of a Syrian airfield, also recovered.Before Wednesday, the March jobs report didn't seem to be a big one. That's because markets already are pricing in a Federal Reserve rate hike in June. But Wednesday's revelation that Fed policymakers expect to begin unwinding the $4.5 trillion central bank balance sheet before year-end raised the stakes. Although markets initially reacted to the report as though it would keep pressure off the Fed, the opposite may be true.Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said on Thursday that companies announced plans for hiring 289,000 workers in the first three months of 2017, the biggest first-quarter hiring plans on record and more than 10 times the total in early 2016. Some of that may have been because President Trump has encouraged such announcements, even if some of the plans don't appear exactly new. Amazon (AMZN) said it will add 100,000 jobs by mid-2018, while Dow component Wal-Mart is adding 10,000 jobs this year.Other recent hiring announcements have come from Charter Communications (CHTR) and Halliburton (HAL), which is a big change from last year's job cuts for the oilfield services firm.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market's uptrend is under pressure, meaning investors should be more cautious in buying stocks and quick to cut losses. Read The Big Picture each day to stay on top of the market's trend.Minutes from last month's Fed meeting revealed that most policymakers ""judged that a change to the committee's reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year.""Instead of continuing to reinvest all of the principal from maturing bonds, which keeps the balance sheet steady, the Fed would gradually let its portfolio run off, assuming the economy continues as expected.As explained by University of Oregon economist Tim Duy, the Fed seems to be signaling that it will tighten monetary policy at a pace roughly equivalent to a quarter-point rate hike every three months. That would mean another hike in September, before the Fed ""switches gears to balance-sheet reduction"" in December.Yet markets aren't currently pricing in another rate hike after June until December. Unless economic conditions soften, expect market pricing to speed up the timetable for rate hikes, as long as the labor market remains in good shape.Keep in mind that ""good"" is in the eye of the beholder. In early March, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that job growth of around 180,000 per month is ""notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor-force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.""Even after January and February payroll gains were revised down by a combined 38,000, the average job gain over the past three months is 178,000, which is plenty fast, as far as the Fed is concerned.RELATED:How The Fed Surprised Markets Again, This Time Hitting StocksFebruary Jobs Growth Strong, But Not Too Strong To Unnerve Investors, Fed

Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%. First Solar (FSLR), which initially popped, closed up less than 1%. China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost about 4%.U.S. crude topped $65 a barrel and Brent edged above $71 briefly as oil inventories continued to drop. Oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) crushed quarterly forecasts, with international growth outpacing domestic growth. Shares shot up 5%, clearing a buy point.

""And I think that's exactly why the hydrocarbon price recovery, despite the OPEC reductions, has been more muted than many had hoped.""U.S. crude futures jumped 2% to $48.68 per barrel Tuesday on reports of Libyan supply disruption but were above $56 at the start of the year. Brent was also up 2% to $51.77.Baker Hughes shares rose 1.7% to 59.07 at the close on the stock market today. GE, which is merging its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, edged up 0.6% to 29.62. Rival oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL) rose 0.5% to 48.02 while Schlumberger (SLB) climbed 1.7% to 78.31.Despite the recent weakness in oil prices, U.S. producers have been finding new ways to operate more efficiently, lowering the price that they need to make a profit.Baker Hughes and GE believe U.S. producers can become even more efficient with the help of Big Data.Craighead said ""intelligence and predictive analytics"" such as ""better reservoir characterization"" will help companies pinpoint where and how to drill and complete wells.He added that GE's cloud-based Predix industrial operating system will help create an Internet of Things for the oilfield, helping cut costs and improve productivity.Meanwhile, GE sees the oil and gas sector saving $220 billion by 2035 from technology-driven productivity, according to a presentation for the Scotia Howard Weil Energy conference.GE also said it plans to have 600 oil and gas data scientists by the end of this year, with 175 in Silicon Valley.GE and Baker Hughes are scheduled to merge their oil and gas operations in the middle of the year. GE said it will file more information about the merger with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Earlier this month, the Justice Department asked for more information regarding their deal.Under the terms of the merger agreement, GE will contribute its oil and gas business and $7.4 billion via a one-time cash dividend to Baker Hughes shareholders.

20,HAL,"The recent retreat in oil prices has weighed on shares of exploration and production companies as well as oilfield services firms, like Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB), that cater to them. But cheaper oil can be good news for refiners, which could see wider profit margins as their input costs drop, and one stock in particular has drawn the attention of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Warren Buffett.Shares of Marathon Petroleum (MPC) are in a cup base with a 54.69 buy point and closed Friday at 50.79. The stock broke out previously in September and November.Valero Energy (VLO) is in a flat base with a 71.50 entry and will start the next trading week at 68.90.Western Refining (WNR) is in a flat base with a 40.19 buy point. It finished Friday at 36.75.Phillips 66 (PSX) has a longer way to go. Shares are in a flat base with an 88.97 entry but are about 10% below that threshold.But for what it's worth, Berkshire has built up its stake in the refiner in the last few years and now holds more than 15%, making Berkshire the top shareholder.The rapid accumulation of shares has raised speculation about a buyout. Last year, an S&P Global Markets Intelligence analyst told IBD that Buffett's pattern of Phillips 66 stock purchases is reminiscent of his transactions leading up to his $9.7 billion acquisition of lubricant and chemical maker Lubrizol in 2011.

21,HAL,"Stocks bets against a successful Trump presidency did nicely on Monday after his first big legislative initiative ended in massive failure.After the flop of RyanCare, which died on Friday before it even came to the House floor for a vote, hospital operators HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) were the best-performing S&P 500 issues.Shares of HCA jumped 5.2% and Universal Health surged 3.35% on the stock market today, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) closed up 1.4%, amid relief that House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash Medicaid spending has been tabled. Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-focused insurer with a big presence on the ObamaCare exchanges, gained 2.2%, and rival Molina Healthcare (MOH) rose 2.75%, as it continued to recover from a 30-month low hit early last week.But health care stocks weren't the only group expected to suffer under Trump's policies that were shining on Monday.Gold miners also rose as the precious metal appreciated to a one-month high on Monday. Newmont Mining (NEM) gained 1.3% and Royal Gold (RGLD) 2.4%. Gold prices perked up as the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield extended their recent declines amid doubts about President Trump's ability to deliver the promised fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.Meanwhile, industrial commodity stocks were among the bigger losers amid concerns that faster growth might not materialize to improve the supply-demand balance.Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) fell 4.7%, while oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) lost 3.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) shed 2.1% as falling market interest rates weighed on the entire financial sector.Most big health insurer stocks were lower on Monday, which might seem surprising after the demise of Ryan's plan that was estimated to shrink the ranks of the insured by 24 million.Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) slipped 0.2%, while Anthem (ANTM) lost 0.3%. The investor reaction may be because health insurers would have benefited from the repeal of ObamaCare's health insurance tax and a further delay of its 40% tax on employer sponsored insurance plans that exceed a so-called ""Cadillac"" threshold. Further, health insurers pay tend to pay high tax rates and stand to benefit from a big cut in the corporate income-tax rate.RELATED:Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?Health Care Stocks Socked Again After CBO RyanCare ScoreFreeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners DiveThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

"
25,HAL,"The battle between OPEC and U.S. shale companies isn't the only cage match in the oil sector. A debate is raging over how innovative producers have become vs. how much they relied on discounts given during the depths of the price bust.Those discounts are now disappearing, and higher demand for labor, equipment and fracking materials is pushing costs up, meaning producers will soon reveal whether they spent the last two years developing new ways to do more with less, or simply coasted by on cheap inputs.The answers that emerge will not only help determine how quickly U.S. crude production recovers and how competitive domestic exploration and production companies will be against OPEC rivals, they will eventually trickle down to the bottom lines and share prices of firms like EOG Resources (EOG), Continental Resources (CLR), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). Global integrated giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which are both on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, may also feel the changes as they focus more on shale plays.""E&Ps will be able to handle the price inflation,"" said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG. ""But it will slow the rate of production increases, absolutely. It doesn't look well on their bottom line, so it won't be as easy to get more money to drill a new well. That's the normal cycle of a market. If you want service companies to survive, you're going to have to pay them more money.""Companies and analysts have thrown around a wide range of numbers on what share of cost savings is due to structural efficiencies and innovation and what share is due to cyclical discounts.At one end of the spectrum, EOG Resources said in November that 75% of its cost savings were from efficiencies. At the other end, Schlumberger (SLB) said last year that ""there has been little to no fundamental change in technology ... and no general transformation of the industry business model.""Barclays analyst Dave Anderson told IBD he would be surprised if more than half of cost savings are structural, estimating the real number to be closer to a third. Meanwhile, Macquarie Securities analyst Paul Grigel thinks half of cost savings are from sustainable improvements and innovation, and Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg agrees.Diverging expectations on cost growth are also emerging. According to a recent Barclays survey, nearly 80% of North American oil companies expect an increase in oilfield service prices, with more than half of them only seeing an increase of up to 10%.But Halliburton's (HAL) CEO Dave Lesar said in January he would ""be using something higher"" than 10% when calculating price increases, adding that while some cost reductions are structural, equipment demand will tighten and prices will rise.Exxon is confident it can keep costs under control, saying planned increases in its capital spending this year and through the end of the decade assume no significant cost inflation, with most of the extra dollars going to exploration and production.To be sure, several factors are at play in the debate. Producers and service providers have incentives to discount what the other says as they negotiate new prices. Different shale formations have different geologic traits that can be costlier or cheaper, though recent innovations have made vast amounts of oil recoverable in places like the Permian Basin. There's also a backlog of wells that were drilled during the downturn but weren't completed as producers waited for prices to rebound. Completing wells today with drilling costs that were booked years ago may skew a company's overall efficiency numbers.The price of oil will also be key as any further increases would spur more activity and boost demand for services.Diamondback Energy CEO Travis Stice told analysts last month he expects service cost increases to be ""muted"" if oil stays rangebound at $50-$55 per barrel. But if prices rise to $55-$60, then he sees cost increases starting to ""accelerate in the back half of the year.""U.S. crude prices edged down 0.1% to settle at $53.14 a barrel on Tuesday.Drilling and completion costs will largely determine the price that companies need to either make a profit or take a loss on a project. In the Permian's Delaware basin, the average break-even price — including drilling and completion costs, operating expenses and royalties — was $32.16 per barrel, according to S&P Global Platts. But if drilling and completion costs rise 10%, the break-even price climbs 8% to $34.74. If those costs jump 25%, the break-even goes up 20% to $38.60 per barrel.About one-third of a well's cost is on the drilling side and two-thirds is on the completion side, according to Barclays' Anderson. Completion includes fracking and bringing oil to the surface.But there is less cost pressure on the drilling side. One reason is that there is still excess supply of equipment like rigs, and improvements in efficiencies are ""stickier,"" said Macquarie's Grigel.The U.S. oil rig count rose to 609 in the latest week, according to Baker Hughes (BHI). That's the highest level since October 2015, but still about 1,000 rigs below the 2014 peak.Among drilling efficiencies, the biggest improvement comes from high-grading, or using ""the best equipment with the best crews,"" Anderson said. Pad drilling — or drilling several wells from a single location vs. moving rigs around — is also popular.Improved sensors and more effective drill bits have shortened drilling times. New rigs have also slashed the time it takes between starting a new well and moving to another well to 7 to 10 days from 3 to 4 weeks.In addition, geosteering services like those from Nabors Industries (NBR) allow companies to drill more accurately. And new lubricants from companies like Flotek (FTK) have reduced drag on drills, while also easing their maintenance needs.Labor cost pressure in drilling services is less pronounced too. Because companies continued to drill wells during the downturn, skilled workers stayed on payrolls and don't need to be coaxed back from another job or state.On the completion side, however, some of the innovations are adding to cost pressures. The biggest is the use of higher proppant loads to release more oil in the fracking process. Longer lateral wells also require more sand. Anderson said producers are now using an average of 4,600 tons of frac sand per well vs. 2,600 tons in 2014.Costs have already gone up for proppants, with sand and chemical companies preparing new rounds of price increases. Last month, fracking materials provider U.S. Silica said it saw positive momentum in pricing in Q3 and Q4, with the trend accelerating in Q1.""We'll see some pretty substantial increases in price as we go through Q1 here,"" said CEO Bryan Shinn, adding that the market will continue to tighten over the coming quarters.Producers have started to back off from higher proppant loads.Trisha Curtis, the president and co-founder of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advising firm, said companies are now fracking closer to the wellbore, allowing them to use cheaper sand vs. pricier specialized ceramics needed with widely spaced fractures. And some companies are hauling their own water to drill sites instead of outsourcing it.Gary Gould, Continental Resources' vice president of production, told analysts last month that the company is using 1,000-2,000 pounds of fracking sand per foot in the Bakken shale play vs. the 3,000 pounds per foot other operators are using. EOG even sees its sand costs falling by 18%, saying it has multiple sand vendors.Labor costs in completion services look to go up as well. The extended pause in completing wells forced workers out of the sector, and they must now be lured back or new ones must be trained. On top of that, companies are now in a hurry to complete those wells.In the Bakken, Continental plans to increase the number of completion crews there to eight by mid-May from five now, but maintain the number of drilling rigs at four through the end of the year.WTRG's Williams expects a short-term labor shortage in completion crews as companies work down those backlogs and compete new wells that were drilled more recently.And while companies established new drilling techniques over the last two years, completions only started to thaw out recently, and producers are still trying to find the right recipe that yields the highest production.There is a completion learning curve, Williams said, and as more wells are completed, new techniques will be found. ""Every time one completion is done you get more information on how to do it better. Some of these improvements are experimental.""But developments in automation look to offset some labor pressure on both the drilling and completion sides. Repetitive or dangerous tasks like connecting pipes, sending them down wells, mixing chemicals and monitoring equipment have been automated at some sites.Nabors Industries even expects more automated drilling rigs will eventually let it slash the number of workers at each well site to just five from 20 today, according to Bloomberg.But what's not automatic is the ability to take advantage of the latest improvements. Good management still matters.Companies that allow their engineers more flexible drilling practices to experiment will do better than those that jump on a drilling frenzy and send efficiencies ""out the window,"" warned PetroNerds' Curtis.Meanwhile, there is an upside to higher costs, which can encourage more innovation, and the current environment may be more favorable than when producers were in survival mode.""The best innovation comes when things aren't booming per se but when you are a little stressed,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group. ""You have to have enough money to do the studies to innovate. But it does help to have a little cost pressure to do that.""RELATED:IEA: Shale Productivity Has Improved By 'Leaps And Bounds' Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms?New Ways The U.S. Can Squeeze Its Oilfields -- And Its Rivals

26,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) topped third-quarter estimates Monday as strong pricing trends in the U.S. oil patch helped power through a recent slowdown in drilling activity.The oilfield service provider's earnings per share from continuing operations shot up to 42 cents from 3 cents a year ago, topping forecasts for 38 cents. Revenue jumped 42% to $5.44 billion, above analysts' estimates for $5.32 billion. North American revenue, which by far makes up the bulk of the top line, soared 91% to $3.16 billion.""Our North American business is hitting on all cylinders and our international business proved resilient in a challenging environment,"" said CEO Jeff Miller in a statement.Completion and production revenue jumped 62.5% to $3.54 billion, while drilling and evaluation revenue rose 15% to $1.91 billion.Shares fell 2.5% to 42.24 on the stock market today. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), which matched forecasts on Friday, slid 2% on Monday. Baker Hughes (BHGE), which missed earnings views Friday, tumbled 5.4% Monday.The results come as the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. has shifted lower in recent months, while domestic crude production has shown signs of stalling.But Halliburton said while the average U.S. rig count grew 6% in Q3 vs. Q2, its North American revenue rose by 14% sequentially due primarily to ""increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States land sector.""Still, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes signaled investment from U.S. oil and gas companies will cool off as they turn their focus more to cash flow vs. expanding production growth.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" said Chairman and CEO Paul Kibsgaard during a conference call with analysts.

27,HAL,"Oilfield service providers Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHGE) warned Friday that their customers have turned cautious with their capital budgets, signaling more cooling ahead in oil production.XWhile U.S. crude prices have regained the $50-per-barrel threshold, they remain volatile and historically low. The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. also has been falling, while domestic production has stalled.Now the outlook for capital expenditures is dimming, as exploration and production companies focus more on financial returns and operating within their cash flows vs. expanding production, Schlumberger said.""In North America land (operations) where companies added capex, production growth is falling short of expectations,"" said Chairman and CEO Paul Kibsgaard during a conference call with analysts. ""This has led to moderating investment appetite.""Baker Hughes offered a similar warning and said the overall oil and gas environment will remain challenged for the rest of the year.""We have seen some improvement in activity, but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitments,"" CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said in an earnings statement. ""Oil prices remain volatile and, as a result, our customers remain cautious.""Shares of Schlumberger were down 2.1% to 63.15 on the stock market today. Baker Hughes erased early losses and closed up 0.3% to 33.26. Halliburton, which reports Monday, edged up 1.2%.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Schlumberger's cautious forecast followed a big gains in Q3. EPS jumped 68% to 42 cents, matching views, as revenue climbed 12.7% to $7.9 billion, also in line with forecasts.North America revenue climbed 18% as spare hydraulic fracturing capacity was redeployed and revenue from North America land operations jumped 23% sequentially despite rig counts only rising 12%. Schlumberger has doubled the number of frack crews in North American in the past six months and has almost all of its capacity deployed.Meanwhile, the outlook overseas is brightening. Kibsgaard said there are ""small, encouraging"" signs of activity growth in Asia so far this quarter and that Russia, the North Sea and Middle East will lead activity growth going into 2018. But Latin American and African markets will remain flat.Schlumberger is still facing pricing pressure in new contracts but the ""downward trend of pricing is slowing significantly,"" and Kibsgaard doesn't think pricing is an issue in the international markets.And while it seems likely OPEC will extend its current production cut, oil stockpiles are near their five-year average, so an extension might not be needed, he added.Baker Hughes, in its first report that incorporated results from its merger with General Electric's (GE) oil and gas unit in early July. earned 5 cents a share on revenue of $5.38 billion, missing estimates for EPS of 12 cents on revenue of $5.5 billion.RELATED:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, Coal

32,HAL,"U.S. stock indexes tacked on small gains midday Tuesday as the S&P 500 index marked a new high.XThe small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 0.5% gain. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. The Nasdaq added 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today inched up on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq.The S&P 500's new high came a day after the Dow Jones utility average scored a new high. While the utility average's new high might suggest a lack of boldness in the stock market, it isn't necessarily so. The growth-oriented Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY) also pegged a new high Monday and Tuesday. The exchange-traded fund debuted on the market in April 2015 but didn't find consistent traction until February 2016.So, the current stock market is rewarding a mix of strategies.Stocks moving up midday Tuesday were a motley group. They included China-based stocks such as TAL Education (TAL), up 1.5%; China Lodging (HTHT), up 1%; Sina (SINA), up 1%; and Alibaba (BABA), up 1%.Other areas showing strength included banks, oil and heavy construction.Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) gapped up 3% in moderately higher volume.

33,HAL,"U.S. diversified stock mutual funds extended their rally in February, picking up steam while tacking on 2.68% on average after gaining 1.83% in January, according to Lipper Inc.That reflected gains by the broad stock market, measured by the S&P 500, which advanced 3.97% last month after notching a 1.90% gain in January. But market leadership rotated back to more defensive sectors, reflecting growing caution among investors.""The more-defensive stocks did well, while cyclical energy and materials did not outperform,"" said Lew Piantedosi, who is lead manager of seven Eaton Vance funds, totaling $3.9 billion in assets. ""It was a complete reversal from the Q4 postelection market rally, which was a cyclicals rally.""Sentiment flipped back in favor of growth-oriented cyclicals after President Trump's address to Congress on the last night of February.But the tilt earlier in February toward cyclicals reflected investors' concern that Trump and the Republican-majority Congress may have a harder time than previously expected in implementing pro-growth policies.Reflecting the optimistic portion of February's market performance, health/biotechnology funds led sectors last month, gaining 6.72%.Among U.S. diversified stock fund categories, S&P 500 index funds led the way with a 3.87% gain.World equity funds lagged U.S. diversifieds, advancing just 1.90%, led by India region funds' 6.08% climb.Taxable bond funds eked out an 0.87% gain on average last month. Emerging markets local currency funds outpaced other taxable categories, rising 1.94%.Piantedosi is guardedly bullish, going forward. ""The bull market is in place until proven otherwise,"" he said. Many investors and market observers have tried to call a market top. But the economy keeps getting better, Piantedosi says. ""Corporate earnings keep getting better, and earnings support the market,"" he added.The wild card that could derail the rally is the political landscape, he warns.As long as the economy stays on track, Piantedosi likes the shift to digital by advertising. ""That benefits Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL),"" he said. ""And Amazon (AMZN) dominates online retail.""Another area he likes is biotech, which is producing a parade of treatments for diseases. ""Celgene (CELG) is a leader within cancer treatments,"" he said. ""It has an unbelievable pipeline. It is growing earnings north of 20% annually and trades at a 17-times forward multiple, just below the market multiple of 18.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. See which biomed/biotech firm is No. 1, and check out its easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.In energy, he likes energy explorer and producer Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and field services provider Halliburton (HAL).He said, ""Anadarko is once again profitably growing production, generating significant cash flow and is attractively valued."" He added, ""Halliburton's exposure is mainly to North American shale, and with oil prices (steady) in the mid-50s, you're starting to see rig counts increase. That increases the need for field services. They put rigs together, service them, replace broken parts and so on.""He added, ""In consumer discretionary, it's hard to find good names. But there's Advance Auto Parts (AAP). They're an auto parts retailer. That sector is less susceptible to be Amazoned. Their business doesn't require a lot of capital expenditure, so it's a good cash flow type of business. And Advance got a new CEO three or four months ago. He's a supply chain expert, which is what Advance needs.""One key reason it is hard for investors to find consumer discretionary that names they like is because so many big-box retailers are getting kicked by online retailers, says James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Asset Management and manager of its $125 million Select Equity (DHAMX). Add to that the risk that many will be forced to cope with higher costs stemming from the border adjustment tax — basically, a value-added tax on imports — proposed by Trump, Abate says.Names in the sector that he does still like include media company CBS (CBS) and specialty food retailer Whole Foods Market (WFM).Sporting an OK 86 Composite Rating from IBD, CBS is trying to clear a consolidation after a run-up that started in the fall.Whole Foods has a very weak Composite Rating of 20 from IBD and is trading at less than half its late 2013 high.The supermarket chain in January reinstalled co-founder John Mackey as sole CEO.Also, the Trump push for infrastructure construction should benefit a number of telecommunications and utility companies, including Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ), Abate says. Comcast has been running up since the election and is near its all-time high. Verizon, range-bound between 57 and 46 since July, is trading near 49, 12% below its 52-week high.Flow-control systems manufacturer Parker-Hannifin (PH) also stands to gain from infrastructure spending. Likewise, Quanta Services (PWR), which provides engineering and construction services. ""They should benefit from increased spending on pipelines and energy transmission projects,"" he said.The market faces risks in the form of geopolitical uncertainty, possible trade wars and rising stock valuations, Abate says. ""There's a lot of downside risk facing this market,"" he said. ""I expect a lot of volatility going forward.""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

34,HAL,"U.S. crude inventories fell less than expected last week, with production levels rebounding. Crude prices rose modestly.XEstimates: Analysts polled by Reuters expected a 2.9 million barrel drop in crude stockpiles for last week from the Energy Information Administration.However, late Tuesday the American Petroleum Institute showed an increase of 1.8 million barrels last week.Results: Crude supplies fell by 1.5 million barrels, EIA said. Gasoline stockpiles dropped by 2.5 million. Crude production increased by 20,000 barrels per day to 9.43 million bpd after last week's unexpected decline.U.S. crude oil futures initially fell, dropping below $49 a barrel, but turned up for a 0.4% gain to $49.36. Brent crude advanced 0.5% to $52.05.U.S. crude recently topped $50 a barrel for the first time in months, in part due to the EIA report that U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles fell while crude production fell. Also lifting oil prices: Nigeria agreed to an eventual production cap and Saudi Arabia said it would further restrain crude exports.Still, concerns remain about oversupply. Reports last week also showed that OPEC output also touched a high for the year, despite promises to curb production in the coming months, Reuters said.Meanwhile, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and shale specialists such as Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) have cut capital spending with crude prices having held below $40 for so long. Oil-services giants Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) are also anticipating a slowdown.Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.4% to 80.50 in the stock market today, while Chevron (CVX) edged up 0.1%. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are Dow components. Pioneer Natural Resources tumbled 11% and Diamondback rebounded to trade up 0.9% after their late Tuesday earnings reports.RELATED:EOG Backs Capex View, While Pioneer, Diamondback, Devon CutOil Rises For Third Day As U.S. Stockpiles Tumble, Production Falls

35,HAL,"U.S. crude stockpiles rose for the sixth straight week, according to Energy Information Administration data out Wednesday, but inventories were down at the key delivery hub in Cushing, Okla.Oil prices reversed higher then turned lower again, with U.S. crude down 0.5% to $52.94 per barrel and Brent down 0.5% at $55.69.Also Wednesday, shale producer Diamondback Energy (FANG) said it sees moderate cost increases if oil prices stay in the $50-$55 a barrel range.The EIA said stocks jumped by 9.5 million barrels, well above the 3.5 million-barrel increase analysts expected but roughly comparable with the 9.94 million-barrel increase the American Petroleum Institute found.""The market realizes that a big part of that increase was the previously announced sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,"" Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote of the API results in his morning energy update.Oil stocks at the Cushing hub were down by 702,000 barrels. Gasoline stocks climbed by 2.8 million barrels vs. analysts expectations for a 752,000-barrel drop. Production was flat at 8.98 million barrels per day.Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares dipped 0.4% to close at 83.16 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) edged up 5 cents to 112.57. Continental Resources (CLR) fell 1.4% to 46.32. EOG Resources (EOG) dipped 0.5% to 100.75.Diamondback Energy hosted its fourth-quarter earnings call Wednesday after reporting Q4 results late Tuesday.As drilling activity continues to ramp back up, the shale producer assumes a 10%-15% increase in service costs this year. But Chief Executive Travis Stice said service prices haven't yet increased in the first quarter, and if oil stays between $50 and $55 per barrel, cost increases would be ""muted.""Diamondback shares jumped 3.9% to 111.84.And when the increases do happen, Stice said they will be on the completion side of operations, especially pressure pumping, vs. the drilling side.In a survey last month, Barclays found that 80% of U.S. exploration and production companies expect an increase in oilfield service prices this year but more than half only expect an increase of up to 10%.But Halliburton (HAL) recently warned oilfield service prices would increase by more than 10% this year.Stice said that Diamondback is insulated from some of the cost increases, as half its total cost savings seen since the downturn started are permanent efficiency gains.Late Tuesday, the company reported Q4 earnings that jumped 58% to 90 cents per share with revenue up 62% to $185 million, both beating Wall Street views. Production rose 38% year-over-year to 51,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day.Looking ahead, Diamondback raised its full year production outlook to 69,000-76,000 barrels per day from 64,000-73,000. The midpoint is 65% higher than the average daily production in 2016.Diamondback also increased its 2017 capital spending target to $800 million-$1 billion from an earlier outlook of $500 million-$600 million.Devon (DVN) also reported Q4 results above analyst estimates late Tuesday. The company plans to spend $2 billion-$2.3 billion on exploration and production in 2017, up from $1.17 billion in 2016, with 90% of that going toward U.S. playsRELATED:OPEC Doubles Non-OPEC Production Growth Outlook On U.S. GainsU.S. Oil Rigs Rise By 8 To 591, Highest Since October 2015

36,HAL,"Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) signaled Friday that they are moving ahead with plans to boost activity in the Permian Basin, despite signs of another slowdown in the U.S. oil patch.XChevron, which is the Permian's largest net acreage holder with about 2 million net acres, plans to add a drilling rig there every 8-10 weeks and have at total of 20 by the end of 2018.Investments in basin have greater than 30% returns with U.S. crude prices at $50 a barrel, said Chevron's upstream vice president, Jay Johnson, who also said Permian earnings should grow on lower operating costs and depreciation rates.On Friday, West Texas Intermediate futures rose 1.4% to $49.71 a barrel, capping an 8.6% weekly gain.And as Chevron's large capital projects mature and roll off its budget, Johnson said Chevron can shift discretionary capital to the Permian over the next several years, noting that the company is ""not holding back capital"" to the basin.Meanwhile, Exxon plans to add three drilling rigs to the Permian by the end of next month, bringing its total there to 19. In January, Exxon announced that it would double its holdings in the Permian by purchasing $5.6 billion in assets in the Delaware section of the basin.Still, as U.S. oil production and drilling activity have seen some declines in recent weeks, management sounded cautious on the outlook for the oil market overall.""We're seeing some progress towards a healthier balance, but there are a lot of variables in play,"" Jeff Woodbury, vice president of investor relations and secretary for Exxon Mobil, told analysts on a conference call.The bullish outlook on the Permian comes as some U.S. producers are pulling back on investment following the latest slump in oil prices. On Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) said it would cut its 2017 capital spending outlook by $300 million. And on Thursday, ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capex guidance by 4%. On Friday, Woodbury said Exxon has ""flexibility"" in its capital program.Exxon shares were down 1.5% at 79.60 on the stock market today, while Chevron climbed 1.9% to 108.12 on strong Q2 results.In Q2, Exxon's EPS jumped 90% to 78 cents, but that missed estimates of 83 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue climbed 9% to $62.88 billion, above views for $61.16 billion.Earnings from upstream operations, which include exploration and production, were $1.2 billion, up by $890 million from a year ago. Earnings from downstream operations, which include refining, were $1.4 billion, up by $560 million from a year ago. Production dipped 1% to 3.9 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and capital spending fell 24% to $3.9 billion.Chevron's adjusted EPS also surged 90%, hitting 91 cents and beating views by 2 cents, and revenue grew 18% to $34.48 billion, above estimates for $31.18 billion.Upstream operations swung to a profit of $853 million from a year-ago loss of $2.46 billion, while downstream earnings slipped 6.5% to $1.2 billion. Production rose 10% to 2.78 billion oil-equivalent barrels a day, with record production seen from its Permian Basin assets.

38,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) sees U.S. exploration and production companies ""tapping the brakes"" and U.S. rig counts plateauing, as oil prices remain stuck below $50 a barrel despite OPEC's efforts to boost them.On Friday, rival oilfield-service provider Schlumberger (SLB) noted that producers operated beyond cash flow and predicted ""at current oil prices, industry will be a bit more constrained than what we've seen in 2016.""Also Friday, Baker Hughes reported that the U.S. oil rig count dipped by one last week, following a drop last month. Domestic crude output has had some hiccups in recent weeks too.The signs of slowing follow OPEC's chronic inability to keep oil prices higher as efforts to curb production are undercut by fears that U.S. firms will seize on the rally to ramp up their own output. But a speed bump in the U.S. may give OPEC some relief in its struggle against global oversupply.OPEC is still trying to lift prices and said Monday that Nigeria would participate in production curbs and Saudi Arabia agreed to cut exports while demanding higher compliance rates from current participants. U.S. oil prices jumped 1.3% to settle at $46.34 per barrel.New Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller tried to put the cooling trend in perspective, saying it's like U.S. companies are slowing down from 80 mph to 70 mph, not headed for a full stop.But the company also saw its first drop in the average amount of sand used per well last quarter. Miller said that while it was just one data point, he would be watching it as the company looks to see how it can deliver sand at a lower cost.""I sense it's more around design,"" he told analysts on a conference call. ""Our clients are dead set on lower costs per barrel.""Producers had been using more sand to squeeze out more oil per well, but in February Continental Resources (CLR) said it planned to use less sand as prices increase and more companies likely followed suit.Halliburton shares reversed early gains and closed down 4.2% at 42.51 on the stock market today. Schlumberger lost 0.2% after dipping 0.7% Friday, when it reported Q2 numbers.Halliburton's Q2 earnings soared to 23 cents per share from 4 cents a year ago, beating Wall Street estimates by 5 cents. Revenue climbed 29% to $4.96 billion, also above above analyst expectations.Halliburton reported sequential North America revenue growth of 24% to $2.8 billion, outpacing the 21% growth of the U.S. land-rig count, as equipment utilization and pricing increased, especially in pressure pumping. North America margins expanded by double digits, and overall completion and production margins jumped by 700 basis points to approximately 13%.International revenue rose 7% sequentially, to $2.2 billion, on increased drilling in Latin America and increased well completion and drilling services in Europe and Africa. But the service company saw a decrease in stimulation services in the Middle East, which weighed on pricing.The company is still bullish on growing North American margins and said its pressure-pumping equipment was sold out for the third quarter. On Friday, Schlumberger said it was sold out until Q4.Baker Hughes, which merged with General Electric's (GE) oil & gas unit to form Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE), will announce Q2 results Friday.

39,HAL,"Schlumberger (SLB) sees growth in North American oil drilling slowing in Q3 but also expects to gain more market share and charge higher prices in horizontal drilling.XWith U.S. crude prices stuck below $50 a barrel again, there are signs that activity may be cooling among exploration and production companies. Baker Hughes reported the U.S. oil rig count dipped by one this week, following a drop last month. Meanwhile, U.S. crude production hit a two-year high last week, but before that, it declined in three out of the prior 10 weeks.""U.S. E&Ps operated beyond cash flow,"" Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard said during the company's conference call. ""At current oil prices, industry will be a bit more constrained than what we've seen in 2016.""The oilfield services provider anticipates its pressure pumping equipment in North America will be deployed at ""almost exactly the same rate"" as during Q2.Still, Schlumberger sees its U.S. land activity remaining strong during the second half of the year, and its fracking calendar is booked into Q4, with all of its pressure pumping equipment active then.""We have never been better positioned to capture growth"" in the region, Kibsgaard said.Surging North American fracking activity and a turnaround in international drilling helped boost Q2 results.North America revenue jumped 27% from a year ago to $2.2 billion. Latin America revenue rose 3% to $1.04 billion. Europe and Africa revenue fell 10% annually to $1.75 billion but gained 6% from Q1. Middle East and Asia revenue slipped 2% annually to $2.35 billion but edged up 1% sequentially.""While the activity outlook in North America for the second half of the year remains robust, we are now also seeing more positive signs in the international markets with increases in activity and new project plans starting to emerge in several GeoMarkets,"" Kibsgaard said in a statement.In the U.S., hydraulic fracturing revenue soared 68% in Q2 vs. Q1 as completions activity intensified and pricing continued to improve. All U.S. land product lines were profitable due to higher pricing, market share gains, improved efficiency, resource additions, and supply chain management.Earnings jumped 52% to 35 cents per share, beating Zacks Investment Research expectations by 5 cents. Revenue was up 4% to $7.46 billion, topping estimates for $7.26 billion.Shares reversed earlier gains and closed down 0.7% at 66.53 on the stock market today, as oil prices lost 2.5% to settle at $45.77 a barrel. Rival Halliburton (HAL), which will report Q2 results on Monday, fell 2.2%. Baker Hughes, which merged with General Electric's (GE) oil & gas unit to form Baker Hughes, a GE Co. (BHGE), slipped 2.4% ahead of its report July 28.Kibsgaard is bullish on oil prices and sees crude inventory declines accelerating in second half of the year.But he warned U.S. producers must start showing some constraint and operating within cash flow while OPEC must continue moderation with its supply-cut deal.OPEC and top nonmembers will meet in Russia Monday to discuss the effectiveness of the deal and if deeper cuts are needed. Reports Friday indicated OPEC production is rising this month.""What will happen in 2018? It's a bit early to say,"" Kibsgaard said. ""As of now, I think it's still likely that we will continue to see strong activity in 2018. But will it have the same type of growth rate in 2017? That remains to be seen.""RELATED:U.S. Crude Output Jumps To Highest In 2 Years; Inventory Falls

""It's going to be a supply and demand market and we will work with those customers that want to work for us.""His prediction of a service price hike above 10% follows a recent Barclays survey that found that more than half of U.S. exploration and production companies see an increase of up to 10% this year.On Friday, competitor Schlumberger (SLB) said the company needs ""significantly higher pricing before we get into a sustainable operating environment"" and that it was in ""active pricing conversations with customers.""Halliburton shares closed down 2.9% at 54.80 on the stock market today.

International revenue rose 2% sequentially to $2.2 billion.Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai had said he was expecting Halliburton to benefit more from its exposure to North America in Q4.""Despite the positive sentiment surrounding the North American land market, it is important to remember that our world is still a tale of two cycles,"" Lesar said in the earnings release. ""The North America market appears to have rounded the corner, but the international downward cycle is still playing out.""Halliburton also said that North American revenue would grow in line with rig count this year. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation jumped last week by 29 to 551, the highest level since November 2015, led by gains in the Permian.RELATED:U.S. Oil Rig Count Soars To Highest Since Nov. 2015, Led By Permian

But another source said that there are worries that only cutting 1.8 million barrels per day from the market isn't doing enough to stabilize prices higher.On Monday, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali Al-Luaibi said he wouldn't comment on deeper production cuts until after the St. Petersburg meeting.U.S. crude closed down 4.1% to $45.13 a barrel, its biggest drop in a month.Exxon Mobil shares fell 1.5% to 80.85 on the stock market today, back below its 50-day line. Chevron was off 1.6% to 104.62.

45,HAL,"After 18 months of courtship and court cases, two massive deals that would have reshaped the U.S. health insurance industry have both been declared dead, blocked by judges who said they'd do unacceptable harm to competition in the industry.Now, the companies are right back where they started. Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion deal to buy Cigna (CI) was blocked by a federal judge late Wednesday, weeks after another judge halted Aetna's (AET) bid for Humana (HUM). Anthem said it'll appeal, and Aetna and Humana have said they're still deciding where to appeal.The question now becomes what the companies will do with the large piles of cash they allocated for the acquisitions, and whether they'll try anew at fresh takeovers under a Trump administration, whose antitrust officials could be more amenable to large consolidations. They could also opt for something more conservative in the face of widespread uncertainty about the future of the U.S. health system.But first, they may be back in court.""Anthem is significantly disappointed by the decision,"" Chief Executive Joseph Swedish said in a prepared statement. ""If not overturned, the consequences of the decision are far-reaching and will hurt American consumers.""Cigna, for its part, said it ""intends to carefully review the opinion and evaluate its options in accordance with the merger agreement."" CEO David Cordani has estimated that his company will have $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital, with the high end including extra debt that the company could take on if it decided to make acquisitions.""We have a track record of being very disciplined relative to our capital priorities and not allowing surplus capital to sit around,"" Cordani said on Jan. 11.Humana may be a target, once again. Cigna or Anthem may make a bid for the Louisville, Ky.-based company, which specializes in the fast-growing business of selling private health plans for the elderly, said Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners. Cigna could also bid for WellCare Health Plans (WCG), she said.Also likely are more conservative moves by the companies, like buying back shares or investing in their own businesses, said Sarah James of Piper Jaffray.""The four deal stocks have been hoarding cash for 18 months, and now that the rulings have been announced, we believe the companies will look to deploy the capital,"" she said in a note to clients. ""The companies will most likely favor share repurchases.""The Justice Department, along with the antitrust division that sued to block the deals, could be remade under new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was confirmed Wednesday. While antitrust officials under the Obama administration aggressively blocked a number of megadeals, over time the antitrust laws have ensured some consistency in enforcement between Republican and Democratic administrations.The case is a holdover from the Obama administration, where the Justice Department thwarted several megamergers, including Comcast's (CMCSA) attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable, Halliburton's (HAL) deal for Baker Hughes (BHI) and AT&T's (T) bid for T-Mobile U.S. (TMUS)""If health-insurance companies are thinking of merging, and they don't really compete with each other, then these decisions shouldn't discourage them,"" said Martin Gaynor, a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Companies with serious overlaps in business would still face obstacles, he said.There's also the risk that Republicans will remake large parts of the U.S. health care system as part of their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Insurance executives may wait to see which parts of the industry the new administration and Congress favor before writing checks.The ACA, which expanded the market for Medicaid health plans and for coverage sold to individuals, hasn't been a big driver of growth for any of the firms. Still, its demise could cut off a source of growth at a time when they're looking for ways to expand.""We expect potential buyers to take their time,"" Thomas Carroll, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said in a research note. ""In our view, all potential buyers will sit back, see how the new administration reshapes U.S. health care, and digest the deal commentary of the last year and a half.""Anthem has also said it would pursue deals and buybacks as its ""Plan B"" if the Cigna transaction didn't go through. CEO Swedish has said he might attempt to expand in the Medicare Advantage market through acquisitions, for example.The 18-month effort to get the transaction done was marked by discord between Anthem and Cigna. Last year, the companies accused each other of violating the merger agreement, and the government said in court that disputes among executives had undercut the rationale for the deal.The hostility could continue. With the deal defeated, Anthem owes Cigna a $1.85 billion breakup fee under the terms of the agreement. Anthem wouldn't have to pay the breakup fee if it could prove that Cigna committed a ""willful breach"" of the merger agreement.The disputes, which spilled into court, harmed the deal's chances, said U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson. She called the hostility the ""elephant in the courtroom.""""Cigna officials provided compelling testimony undermining the projections of future savings, and the disagreement runs so deep that Cigna cross-examined the defendants' own expert,"" she wrote. ""Anthem urges the court to look away, and it attempts to minimize the merging parties' differences as a 'side issue,' a mere 'rift between the CEOs.' But the court cannot properly ignore the remarkable circumstances that have unfolded both before and during the trial.""The Anthem-Cigna case turned on the market for health plans sold to employers. In her ruling, Jackson looked at its likely effect on the sale of health insurance to ""national accounts"" — customers with more than 5,000 employees, usually spread over at least two states — within the 14 states where Anthem operates as the Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee.""Eliminating this competition from the marketplace would diminish the opportunity for the firms' ideas to be tested and refined, when this is just the sort of innovation the antitrust rules are supposed to foster,"" Jackson said in her 12-page order. Her accompanying opinion fully detailing her reasons for ruling against the deal was filed under seal.Acting Assistant Attorney General Brent Snyder of the Justice Department's antitrust division called the ruling ""a victory for American consumers.""""This merger would have stifled competition, harming consumers by increasing their health insurance premiums and slowing innovation aimed at lowering the costs of health care,"" Snyder said in a statement.

55,HAL,"Oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) likely didn't see any pricing improvements in the third quarter, but if U.S. oil stays around $50 per barrel, activity in North America will increase in the fourth quarter.Analysts see Halliburton reporting a 7-cent-per-share loss, swinging from a 31-cent-per-share gain in the year-ago quarter when it announces results Wednesday.

64,HAL,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly reached a deal to buy four Lockheed Martin (LMT) Littoral Combat Ships for $6 billion, as part of a $100 billion arms package that is expected to be finalized during President Trump's visit to the Middle East ally.The deal is expected to be announced Saturday, according to Bloomberg, when President Trump arrives in Riyadh. The ships had already been approved by the State Department in 2015 but the deal wasn't completed under President Obama.X A flurry of deals across the defense and energy sectors are expected during Trump's first presidential visit abroad.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which costs roughly $1 billion, is expected to be part of a massive $100 billion defense package as well as software for command and control capabilities and satellite communications systems, also from Lockheed.Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly helped push the THAAD deal though by calling Lockheed's CEO Marillyn Hewson and asking her to lower the price for the Saudis, according to the New York Times.And a formal agreement for more Pac-3 Patriot missiles from Lockheed is expected as it has already been approved by Congress.Raytheon (RTN) is another big defense winner as Trump is expected to lift the Obama administration's hold on a $1 billion sale of  Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs.An order for 115 M1A2 General Dynamics (GD) tanks is expected to be finalized during the visit as well.Lockheed shares rose 2% to 272.76 on the stock market today, retaking a 270 buy point.

65,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) said an oil price of $50 per barrel is enough to spur ""a significant increase"" in U.S. drilling, even as OPEC and its partners struggle to keep crude higher.U.S. oil futures hovered around that level Monday, closing down 0.8% at $49.23 a barrel, after diving nearly 7% last week on continued worries over increased U.S. production.""In North America, $50 oil prices would drive a significant increase in activity,"" said Halliburton President Jeff Miller during the company's conference call.International activity, however, has bottomed out and will react less to a specific price and more on overall stability of pricing, Miller said, noting that the Middle East overall has been resilient.The comments come as OPEC and top non-OPEC producers weigh whether to extend their agreement to reduce output. While the deal struck late last year initially lifted crude, the price has come back down as U.S. companies rushed to pump more oil.Meanwhile, U.S. shale companies don't need oil prices to be high, as improved their drilling techniques and technologies have enabled them to extract oil profitably at lower prices.But the additional demand for oilfield services is allowing Halliburton to charge higher prices, after the company along with Schlumberger (SLB) and others in the space offered steep discounts to exploration and production companies during the depths of the oil bust.Halliburton has said since October that it was committed to raising prices again, even if that means potentially losing customers and market share. After reporting Q4 results last January, management said it was accommodating customers that agreed to higher prices but walked away from those who didn't.Now, Halliburton has seen pricing gains in pressure pumping and well construction service lines across all its North American shale basins.""We are basin agnostic in terms of how were are positioned,"" Miller said. ""Clearly the Permian has the most activity. I like the way we are positioned in each market. Fleets are busy, and we are starting to see the calendar firm up.""Halliburton shares were down 0.7% to close at 46.75 on the stock market today, after rising 2% earlier as Q1 results topped views. Schlumberger fell 1% to 74.10. Baker Hughes (BHI), which is merging its oil and gas operations with General Electric (GE) and reports Tuesday, climbed 1.7% to 58.65.Halliburton's adjusted earnings fell 43% to 4 cents per share, above analyst views for 3 cents. Revenue rose 1.9% to $4.28 billion, beating Wall Street views for $4.26 billion.Expectations were muted after the oilfield service provider warned on international activity last month.North America revenue rose 24.4% with U.S. onshore revenue up nearly 30%. International revenue fell 8% as seasonal declines in activity were ""exacerbated by the current cyclical headwinds,"" CEO Dave Lesar said in a release.Still Halliburton expects Middle East and Asia revenue to remain flat in Q2.On Friday, Schlumberger said investments in the Middle East and Russia ""will remain resilient"" but activity won't really start to accelerate until 2018.It also reported a 37.5% drop in quarterly earnings in line with views. While revenue increased 5.7% to $6.89 billion, Schlumberger's first increase in revenue in two years, it fell short of Wall Street views for $6.97 billion. Still, Instinet raised its price target on Schlumberger to 91 from 85 on Monday.Schlumberger, which generates most of its revenue overseas, had been more cautious about redeploying its U.S. fracking equipment than Halliburton, but Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard said Schlumberger plans to have its entire current idled capacity deployed in Q4.RELATED: Saudi Arabia Says Top Producers Agree To Extend Cuts, But Oversupply Weighs

But the rebound in crude has boosted demand for services and materials, and rival Halliburton (HAL) has said it is ready to increase prices, even if it means losing some market share.Schlumberger said exploration and production investments in North America will increase by 30% this year with the biggest growth seen in the Permian basin, ""which should lead to both higher activity and a long overdue recovery in service industry pricing.""""On fracking, we need significantly higher pricing before we get into a sustainable operating environment,"" CEO Paal Kibsgaard said during a conference call with analysts. ""We are having active pricing conversations with customers.""He added that 2017 will be a starting point of new multiyear cycle to reverse the effects of several years of underinvestment in exploration and production.Nearly 80% of U.S. exploration and production companies expect an increase in field service prices, a recent Barclays survey showed. More than half, though, only see an increase of up to 10% this year.Shares closed down 0.8% at 86.49 on the stock market today as Q4 earnings met views.

Schlumberger's Q4 earnings plunged 58.5% to 27 cents a share, in line with analyst views, while revenue fell 8% to $7.11 billion, ahead of estimates for $7.07 billion.North American revenue rose 4%, Middle East and Asian revenue climbed 5%, while Latin American revenue fell 4%.""One thing we saw that maybe gave us a little bit of pause was the 4% revenue increase in North America,"" said Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai. ""Given that the U.S. rig count was up 20% we were looking for a little bit more.""Desai said Halliburton is a stronger pick for investors as it has more exposure to North American land drilling, but he sees Schlumberger boosting investment in North America.While the company has said all markets have hit their bottoms, management still expects weakness overseas, and Desai doesn't expect international markets to pick up until later this year or early next year.RELATED:Burlington, Halliburton Are Buys; Disney Downgraded; Schlumberger Hold Does OPEC Have Anything Left In The Tank As U.S. Shale Looms

Part of the reason is that Schlumberger and other oilfield service providers slashed prices during oil's downturn.Now that oil price have gone up in the wake of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' deal to cut output, the question is whether service providers will raise prices. In November, Halliburton (HAL) said it's open to increasing its prices even if it means losing some customers.And oil firms seem ready for price hikes. Nearly 80% of U.S. exploration and production companies expect an increase in field service prices, a recent Barclays survey showed. More than half, though, only see an increase of up to 10%.Schlumberger shares fell 0.3% to 87.21 on the stock market today. Halliburton, which reports next week, rose 0.4%. Baker Hughes (BHI) shares advanced 0.4% also.Analysts don't see international service price increases until later this year or early next year.On Thursday, sources told Reuters that Halliburton signed a $210 million deal to drill 30 wells for Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) in Iraq's Majnoon field. Shell shares dipped 0.6%.The deal comes after sources told Reuters in November that Shell was considering exiting Iraq.Iraq had been a major opponent of the OPEC production cut and wanted to be exempt as it needs oil revenue to fight the Islamic State.Earlier this month Reuters and Bloomberg said Iraq was boosting exports from Basra field. Iraq's prime minster accused the autonomous Kurdish region of exporting more than what it was allowed.RELATED:U.S. Oil Rig Count Falls, But Crude Caps 3% Weekly Slide

69,HAL,"As Donald Trump assumes the presidency and the GOP Congress works to kill ObamaCare, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt said Friday that some customers could become more cautious.Still, the industrial conglomerate sees better prospects for its healthcare business internationally as the middle class grows in other nations.""If I took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most attention in the media and by our customers,"" Immelt said on a conference call after reporting mixed Q4 results. ""I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven't really seen that much. But that could happen.""GE also said it was more upbeat about the U.S. economy and sees ""strengthening"" in Europe, while oil-related markets are ""stabilizing,"" helped by OPEC's deal to curb oil production.But Q4 offered up a lot of what Wall Street had heard for much of 2016: slow growth, volatility and ongoing weakness in the oil sector. And some on the Street may have been concerned about sales in the company's reliable power segment.Organic revenue and orders, two much-watched figures, fell 1% and 3%, respectively. Oil and gas revenue and transportation revenue — which respectively sank 22% and 23% in Q4 — have weighed on the industrial giant's results due weaker commodity demand.""It's largely a repeat of what we heard in the previous several quarters in 2016,"" Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said.Earnings per share fell 12% to 46 cents, matching estimates. Revenue slipped 2% to $33.1 billion, missing forecasts for $33.63 billion. GE backed its 2017 organic growth target of 3%-5%.Aviation revenue rose 7%, as air carriers update their fleets with planes containing GE's engines. Renewable energy revenue jumped 29%. Healthcare revenue increased 3%. Power systems revenue rose 20%.""I think there's some concern more in that power business that sales were weaker than expected,"" Windau said. ""Some of those orders or shipments got pushed out into 2017.""GE this week said it secured more than $1.4 billion in orders from the Iraqi government to develop power plants.Shares fell 2.2% to 30.53 on the stock market today, dropping below their 200-day line and slipping further below a buy point of 31.59 after breaking out last month.General Electric in recent years has tried to focus more on its industrial roots — and become more of a tech company. GE's oil and gas unit will merge with oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHI) this year.Baker Hughes edged up 2 cents to 61.98. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), which also reported results Friday, fell 0.8%, and Halliburton (HAL) climbed 2% ahead of its report Monday.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric has attempted to turn more into a tech company, with a big, long-term focus on the so-called Industrial Internet. GE, like other industrials, had warned of a slow-growth environment due to the rout in commodity prices and a sluggish global economy. Several big industrial companies will follow GE's report next week.United Technologies (UTX) reports Q4 results early Wednesday: EPS up 14% to $1.56 with revenue essentially flat at $14.7 billion. Caterpillar (CAT) reports early Thursday: EPS down 11% to 66 cents as revenue slides 10.8% to $9.84 billion. Honeywell (HON) reports early next Friday: EPS up 10% to $1.74 with revenue up 1.7% to $10.15 billion.Some analysts say investors could be focused more on how GE and other industrials might do in the second half of this year and beyond, when oil and commodity prices may rebound more strongly and policies under the incoming Trump administration become more concrete.""These things, from an economic perspective, are taking time to work their way through the system,"" Windau said.RELATED:General Electric Stock Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Q4 Report

73,HAL,"Schlumberger (SLB) finally reported a rise in revenue and said it would deploy more equipment in North America in Q2, but it warned that the global oil and gas industry's underinvestment is unsustainable. Yet with crude futures tumbling during the week to below a key level, it's unclear how much energy companies will want to invest, especially outside of U.S. shale fields.EPS fell 37.5% to 25 cents, in line with analyst views. Revenue rose 5.7% to $6.89 billion, Schlumberger's first increase in revenue in two years, but short of Wall Street views of $6.97 billion.North American revenue rose 6% sequentially to $1.87 billion, while international revenue fell 7% to $4.92 billion, mostly on weakness in Asia and Africa.Meanwhile, the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by five to 688 this week, the 14th straight gain, Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday.U.S. crude futures fell 2.2% to $49.62 a barrel on Friday, capping a 7.4% weekly loss.Schlumberger shares fell 2.2% to 74.84 on the stock market today, hitting an 11-month intraday low of 73.15.""As the recovery builds momentum, industry cash flow and productivity remain under pressure and limit the industry's ability to increase present levels of E&P investment,"" said Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard in a statement. ""At the same time, the value chain remains focused on trying to capture the limited value that is created, rather than seeking new ways to collectively create more value. This approach is not sustainable, either from addressing the underlying industry challenges or from ensuring that the future supply of hydrocarbons can meet the projected growth in demand.""Kibsgaard expects another challenging year for its international segment as he sees a third year of underinvestment outside the Middle East, Russia and land operations in North America.But there are some signs of good news.Latin American revenue was flat, a sign that the market has reached a bottom in the region Kibsgaard said on the company's conference call and investments in the Middle East and Russia ""will remain resilient"" but activity won't really start to accelerate until 2018.Still the recovery ""will be led"" by North American land drilling, where Kibsgaard sees a 50% increase in investment levels this year.Schlumberger, which generates most of its revenue overseas, has been more cautious about jumping back into U.S. fracking than peers like Halliburton (HAL) have been, but Kibsgaard said Schlumberger plans to have its entire current idled capacity deployed in Q4 as deployment accelerates in Q2.""Halliburton is accelerating their reactivation,"" said Kevin Simpson, managing director at Griffin Securities, before Schlumberger's report. ""Those costs are going to hurt near-term earnings, but I think it's the right thing to do given the customer base in general has geared itself to be able to expand in a $50+ oil environment.""Schlumberger expects ""solid top line growth"" in its North American land segment on continued rig count growth and a growing market share in directional drilling.General Electric (GE), which is merging its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes later this year, also reported early Friday. GE beat earnings estimates, but oil and gas revenue fell 3%.Halliburton shares fell 1.1%.

78,HAL,"General Electric (GE) reports fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, after several months of lamenting an environment marked by ""slow growth.""And while CEO Jeff Immelt in October said the industrial giant's orders and organic growth would pick up steam in the fourth quarter, analysts remain cautious.""GE had a rough 2016 and 4Q is an important quarter to show order stability, margin gains, and cash flow improvement,"" Barclays analyst Scott Davis said in a research note, also predicting sequential improvement in 2017.Wall Street expects fourth-quarter earnings per share to fall 11.5% to 46 cents, with revenue dipping 0.5% to $33.66 billion.The company's power and renewables segments are expected to be strong, while transportation and oil & gas — which are still shaking off the effects of a global commodity oversupply — are expected to be weaker, Credit Suisse said in a recent research note.And despite GE's attempts to cut costs, strip back its finance operations to focus on its core industrial segments as well as become more of an industrial analytics firm, Credit Suisse sees earnings lagging those of its peers due to ""sluggish"" orders while consensus forecasts for the first half of the year look too high.But, as with other sectors, investors could be more focused on any guidance. The energy sector has rallied as crude prices recovered late last year, and investors will look for an update on GE's prospects in that market.In October, GE and Baker Hughes (BHI) in October announced a deal to combine GE's oil and gas operations with the oilfield services giant, whose merger with Halliburton (HAL) was called off earlier in the year due to antitrust concerns. Halliburton has said it's willing to sacrifice market share to boost profits as discounts offered during the oil bust are rolled back.Meanwhile, the U.S. oil-rig count has shot up and shale companies are ramping up 2017 exploration and production budgets, boosting demand for oilfield services and equipment.GE shares were down 0.1% at 31.21 on the stock market today. The stock broke out last month but dropped below its 31.59 entry last week. A strong Q4 report could send GE back in buying range.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric has attempted to turn more into a tech company, with a big, long-term focus on the so-called Industrial Internet. GE's Q4 report kicks off big industrial earnings and will come after a Q3 earnings season in which a variety of industrials offered cloudier forecasts. Honeywell (HON), citing in part weakness in aerospace, cut its sales and profit outlook, while Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) warned of a weaker economy.The election sent industrials surging on expectations of an infrastructure spending package and corporate tax cuts. But the market appears to be tiring of its fling with President-elect Donald Trump, and Q4 results will test the sentiment of new shareholders.""Are the new owners in it just for the Trump infrastructure/tax trade and likely to jump at the first sign of weakness?"" Barclays analyst Davis wrote. ""Are they prepared for what will likely be another very soft quarter?""He said investors are likely to ignore short-term struggles and look ahead toward the second half of the year, when the rebound in oil and gas could strengthen and Trump's policy proposals become clearer either at that time or later.""We think 2017 is a year to buy into any dips,"" Davis said, ""and we do expect some.""RELATED:Apple, General Electric, Microsoft Lead Field In Stock Buybacks

84,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue growth on Monday, with international market revenue growth surprisingly outpacing U.S. growth, as rising crude prices spur strong demand for the oilfield services giant. Shares moved past a buy point.X Halliburton has always had a stronger focus on the U.S. than internationally, but the no. 2 oilfield services provider said it saw Q4 international revenue increase 11% sequentially to $2.5 billion on increased activity in Latin America and in the eastern hemisphere.  North America revenue rose 7% to $3.4 billion.""Their international revenues grew faster,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg said.

"
86,HAL,"Are energy stocks and mutual funds about to run out of gas? Or have they still got fuel in their tanks? Energy-focused stock mutual funds have been turbocharged during the past year. They've gained roughly twice as much on average as the broad market in the form of the S&P 500, in the 12 months ended Jan 18. Their average 12-month trailing yield is more than double the S&P 500's.In addition, they've outperformed and provided higher yield than income-oriented stock mutual funds overall as well.Many companies involved with energy production have highly appreciated share prices. The question going forward is, can they keep it up?Their kissing cousins, power utilities, have the opposite problem. Many have sold off, giving a big boost to their dividend yields. Seen by many investors as proxies for bonds, many utilities sold off in the run-up to the Federal Reserve's December interest rate hike and the prospect of future hikes. So, can these rally?Robin Wehbe, a manager of $313.7 million Dreyfus Natural Resources (DLDRX), says energy stocks still have room to run in part because the oil downturn forced many to begin cutting costs. Ongoing cost-cutting combined with stable oil prices around $50 a barrel or higher assures many oil services firms of a path to profitability, he says.Skip Aylesworth, co-manager of $1.4 billion Hennessy Gas Utility (GASFX), says many natural gas distribution companies are now geared to be profitable with the price of gas above $3 per million metric British thermal units (mmBTU), and the fuel is above that threshold.In addition, many state regulators have begun to offer local and regional utilities rate formulas that are more profitable if the utilities replace aging underground pipes. Pipe replacement is often a 10- to 20-year process, Aylesworth says. So incentives can give utilities a way to transform 2% to 3% annual earnings into 9% to 11% for decades, he adds.Jay Hatfield, manager of InfraCap MLP ETF (AMZA), expects oil to break out of its $50 to $55 range and trade as high as $70 as the summer driving season approaches. Energy infrastructure MLPs should benefit, he says, as many are still trading at what he sees as oversold prices.IBD's TAKE: This IBD report looks at strategies for deriving income from dividend stocks at a time when rising interest rates are clobbering bonds and bond proxies.The stakes are high.Energy-focused stock funds' average gain of 55.55% over the past 12 months more than tripled the 17.85% average gain by all income-oriented stock mutual funds in that span. And their 4.56% 12-month yield more than doubled the 1.87% average yield of income-oriented stock funds.Many funds categorized as growth & income had zero or little yield in that year.Reflecting the outperformance and excess yield of energy-focused funds in the past 12 months, the bulk of all top-performing income-oriented stock funds were energy sector funds or energy-focused master limited partnership (MLP) funds. The latter invest in MLPs whose business tends to be running energy pipeline companies.There is a similar predominance of energy funds when you look at just portfolios with $100 million or more in assets.Among the top holdings in Wehbe's fund are oil and gas field services companies Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL). Wehbe, who did not discuss individual names, said, ""Field services stand out uniquely (in the energy space)."" There is little new need for large extraction equipment, he says. There is greater need for services and small equipment.""Tightness will come from the short-cycle consumables business,"" he added. ""We mean valves and measurement tools, things from something like a hardware store for the oil patch.""Schlumberger and Halliburton have modest Composite Ratings of 50 and 55 from IBD. Their dividend yields are 2.3% and 1.3%.An energy infrastructure MLP that Hatfield likes is Apache (APA). ""If we are correct about the oil markets (surging in per-barrel price to nearly 70), energy stocks and energy infrastructure MLPs are very likely to outperform the market,"" he said. ""We like Apache, which trades at a reasonable multiple of 2017 Ebitda, has exposure to the attractive Permian basin and has been discussed as a potential takeover candidate.""Its Composite Rating from IBD is a weak 43.Aylesworth, who focuses mainly on natural gas distributors, says there has been a lot of consolidation in the local distribution company (LDC) market. Nova Scotia-based Emera completed its acquisition of Tampa, Fla.-based TECO Energy last July. ""M&A activity in that space will continue,"" Aylesworth said. ""The acquirers keep getting stronger.""For Emera, that takeover boosted its exposure to rate-regulated markets, which provides stability to revenue and earnings. At the same time, it provides Emera entry to a growing market.Trading around 46, the stock is 8% below its July 7 high.Aylesworth also likes Tulsa-based ONE Gas (OGS), which he describes as a local distributor in regulated markets. He likes the fact that the company has an expanding footprint in communities that are growing in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Last week the utility raised its quarterly dividend by 7 cents per share to 42 cents, resulting in a $1.68 per share dividend and a yield of 2.7%.Like Atmos Energy (ATO), another local distribution pure play, ""these companies are pretty fully valued, but earnings will continue to grow,"" he said. ""They're good mom-and-pop investments.""ONE Gas has a weak 54 Comp Rating. It has bounced off its 10- and 40-week moving averages. Trading around 64, it is not far from its all-time high above 67 in July. Atmos, with a weak 59 Comp Rating, is also trying to stay above its short- and long-term moving averages. Trading around 75, it's not far from last July's high near 82.Calgary-based TransCanada (TRP) and Enbridge (ENB) both operate major long-distance energy pipeline networks. TransCanada's network extends from Canada into Mexico. Enbridge's extends east and west as well as north-south. In long-distance pipelines, ""these are these are the big kahunas,"" Aylesworth said. ""They have good balance sheets and histories of increasing dividends.""TransCanada has a so-so Comp Rating of 75. Its dividend yield is 3.6%. Enbridge's is 3.7%. It has a weak 46 Comp Rating. Both are trading near their September highs.RELATED:Leading Stocks That Are Driving A Hot Mutual Fund's RallyWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

90,HAL,"Workday (WDAY), Halliburton (HAL), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and RSP Permian (RSPP) just finished handles to their cup bases. And they are all first-stage bases. Halliburton blasted past its buy point Monday, while Workday edged past its entry point in low volume.X First- and second-stage bases are more likely to succeed and rise sharply than late-stage bases. Mutual funds and other big institutions are more apt to want to add to holdings for stocks in early-stage bases, while cashing in profits on late-stage bases after a long run.With the S&P 500 index rising for 14 of the last 15 months — the S&P 500's sole loss a drop of less than one point in March 2017 — many recent breakouts have tended to be third-, fourth-, fifth- or even sixth-stage bases.So investors should take a look when first-stage bases like Workday develop. Halliburton, Pioneer Natural Resources and RSP Permian are all oil plays coming out of long consolidations, with Halliburton reporting strong earnings Monday morning. One note of caution: The relative strength line — which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index — is not in great shape for any of these stocks. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.)Workday's cup-with-handle base started in late November. The stock sold off sharply at the end of that month and early December, especially after the software maker reported earnings that easily beat views, but had details that disappointed investors. Shares began recovering but didn't retake their 50-day line until Jan. 4. With its new handle, Workday is now less than 1% below a 114.98 buy point.Workday's RS line is well off its late November peak, and really hasn't made much progress since early June.Workday rose 1% to 115.30 on the stock market today, moving past the buy point. But trading volume was well below normal, while the relatively small price move means that the RS line was unable to rise above even the very short-term peak around the handle.IBD'S TAKE: So early-stage bases are preferable. Learn more about how to count bases to profit in long, bull markets.Halliburton is in a cup-with-handle base going all the way back to January 2017. The buy point is 53.79.Oil companies struggled in 2017, especially oilfield services firms like Halliburton that saw their customers slashing spending. But with crude prices at a three-year high, the energy sector has rebounded.Halliburton earnings topped Q4 views early Monday.

92,HAL,"Aetna's (AET) $37 billion deal to buy rival insurer Humana (HUM) was blocked by a federal judge Monday, thwarting one of two large mergers that would reshape the U.S. health care landscape. Aetna said it was considering an appeal.The transaction would violate antitrust laws by reducing competition among insurers, U.S. District Judge John D. Bates in Washington ruled. With the deal defeated, Aetna owes Humana a $1 billion breakup fee under the terms of the merger agreement.Aetna lost 2.5% in midday trades. Humana fell 1.4%. Molina Healthcare (MOH), which would have benefited from a deal to buy divested assets from Aetna and Humana, slumped 2.5%.""We're reviewing the opinion now and giving serious to consideration to an appeal after putting forward a compelling case,"" T.J. Crawford, an Aetna spokesman, said. A Humana spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The ruling is another victory for antitrust enforcement efforts initiated by the Obama administration. A separate Justice Department challenge, against Anthem's (ANTM) $48 billion bid for Cigna (CI), is also pending a ruling. Investors saw the ruling as a bad sign for that deal. Anthem fell 1.1%, while Cigna lost 0.5%.""If the judge blocked this deal, there is very little, if any, chance that the Anthem-Cigna deal gets cleared,"" Jason McGorman, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said by email. He added that analysts and investors had thought that the Aetna-Humana deal ""had a better chance of settlement/clearance"" than Anthem-Cigna.The Obama Justice Department frustrated a slew of megamergers amid a wave of record deal making, including Comcast's (CMCSA) attempted takeover of Time Warner Cable, Halliburton's (HAL) deal for Baker Hughes (BHI) and AT&T's (T) bid for T-Mobile US (TMUS). The Trump administration is taking over investigations into AT&T's deal for Time Warner (TWX) and Bayer's (BAYRY) proposed combination with Monsanto (MON).The government case against the merger focused on the market for private health plans for the elderly, known as Medicare Advantage. The U.S. argued the Aetna-Humana deal would have eliminated competition between the insurers in 364 counties in 21 states and likely forced seniors to pay higher premiums for Medicare Advantage plans. It also threatened competition on the insurance exchanges set up under ObamaCare, the Justice Department said.Aetna countered that the Medicare market is much larger than the Justice Department claims because it includes both Medicare Advantage plans and original Medicare, providing more choice for seniors than the government portrayed. Competition on the exchanges isn't an issue, they said, because Aetna withdrew from all 17 counties at issue in the government's case.The judge sided with the government's view of the Medicare Advantage market.""In that market, which is the primary focus of this case, the merger is presumptively unlawful — a conclusion that is strongly supported by direct evidence of head-to head competition as well,"" Bates wrote. ""The companies' rebuttal arguments are not persuasive.""

93,HAL,"Your personal finance plan in 2017 will be like baking a cake. All you'll need is the right recipe. Whether you're investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds in a 401(k) retirement account, now's the time to check to make sure you have the right ingredients at hand.For Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, the recipe involves six ingredients: overweight U.S. stocks in general; underweight 10-year Treasury bonds; and overweight financial services stocks, U.S. small-cap stocks, energy stocks and industrial companies' stocks.Orlando's colleague, Steve Chiavarone, associate manager of $414 million Federated Global Allocation Fund (FSTBX), cites holdings which illustrate that recipe. Among them, Apple (AAPL) could see higher profits if corporate taxes are lowered as President-elect Trump wants. It could also boost stock dividends or buybacks and spend more to develop new products with repatriated cash under Trump's tax proposal. ""Still, Trump has issues with parts of the tech industry, so Apple's may be a more mixed picture,"" Chiavarone said.In addition, a more lenient regulatory environment for banks would convert JPMorgan (JPM) from a something akin to a regulated utility back into a growth stock, Chiavarone says. Oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) should get more mileage out of its run, fueled by rising energy prices, he adds. And construction aggregates producer Martin Marietta (MLM) is poised to benefit from a boom in infrastructure projects.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta is No. 2 in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete-Aggregates industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 83 IBD Composite Rating and very strong 96 EPS (earnings per share) Rating stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.To Orlando and Chiavarone, the 2017 recipe aims to take advantage of several macroeconomic forces now in play.In financials, $1.2 billion Third Avenue Value (TAVFX) lead manager Chip Rewey says U.S. regional banks are likely to benefit from rate hikes and scaled-back regulation. Their valuations are also relatively low ""since people have shunned them since the financial crisis.""Banks he likes include top holdings Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Comerica (CMA), PNC Financial (PNC) and Keycorp (KEY). All have strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the 80s or 90s.Among other stocks, he said home-builder ""Lennar (LEN) is a new position for Value Fund because housing should do well."" Its balance sheet is improving, it is reducing debt and it is trimming its land bank.He also recently bought shares in Johnson Controls (JCI). Some investors still think of it as a maker of automotive seating, a field it has exited. ""Its hidden gem is its car batteries,"" Rewey said. ""They are a leader in lead acid batteries and in start-stop batteries. And they, not Tesla (TSLA), are the leader in lithium ion car batteries.""In addition, Rewey likes biotech Amgen (AMGN), a relative newcomer to the portfolio, largely ""because the market is ignoring its strong pipeline.""And true to his value orientation, Rewey likes apparel company Ralph Lauren (RL). Earnings per share growth has declined eight straight quarters. The stock's Comp Rating is a dismal 7. ""But Rewey likes CEO Stefan Larsson's turnaround credentials. ""We think it's a great opportunity,"" Rewey said.Lee DeLorenzo, president of United Asset Strategies in Garden City, N.Y., says workers should try to take advantage of the same apparent forces in their 401(k) accounts. At the same time, they should cut their interest-rate risk by shifting 5% to 10% of their weighting in traditional bond funds to stable value funds or flexible, go-anywhere bond funds.She advises increasing exposure to small- and midcap stocks and stock funds. Plan members who can stomach risk, she says, should boost their weightings in financials and energy.Rich Weiss, a senior portfolio manager on a team that oversees 20 American Century target-date, target-risk and asset-allocation funds, says 401(k) plan members should also look at whether the year-end spurt in stock prices threw their target asset allocations out of whack. Does your mix of stocks, large and small, U.S. and foreign, specific geographies and selected sectors, still jibe with your overall financial plan? Your risk tolerance? Your financial goals?If something has grown too big, take profits to rebalance. Keep the proceeds inside your account to avoid an early withdrawal.Plan members who'd rather not make their own investment decisions should leave the heavy lifting to target-date and target-risk funds within their accounts, he says. If you do want to forge your own investment decisions, you can look for ideas at the asset allocations of target date and target risk portfolios that match your situation. ""But doing that may be more expensive and complex than simply purchasing an appropriate target-date fund,"" Weiss added.If your 401(k) does not offer target-date or target-risk funds? Consider investing that same money instead in such a fund inside an IRA, where your investment choices are almost unlimited.In addition, Weiss says, if your 401(k) offers a Roth option, use it if you are young and if your tax bracket will stay the same or rise after you retire. Meanwhile, contributions are not tax deductible. But earnings grow tax-deferred. And withdrawals normally will be tax-free, unlike withdrawals from a regular 401(k) or IRA.Suppose you share the Orlando-Chiavarone vision of what 2017 is to bring. How do you act on it?One approach would be to boost the assets, sectors and geographies that they expect to thrive by 10% in your portfolio. Trim from assets like long Treasuries and emerging-markets stocks. You can tweak those numbers up or down, depending on factors such as your time horizon, risk tolerance, long-term goals and any near-term need for cash.If you're an aggressive investor in your 30s, for instance, you might want to boost your U.S. small caps by 11% or 12%.In any case, first form your 2017 financial action plan, either with your financial advisor or on your own. Then look for securities that can bring that plan to life. It's not all that hard. In fact, reflecting holiday cheer, DeLorenzo said, ""The execution of these changes is as easy as baking a cake.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges A Top 2016 Mutual Fund ManagerWhere Mutual Fund Pros See Big Stock Gains In 2017Here's How To Decide Which Retirement Accounts To Fund First

97,HAL,"ESPN recently re-aired a three-part documentary about the long rivalry between two storied NBA basketball teams, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics, and their two marquee players, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, respectively.XAfter another devastating Laker loss, this time in the 1984 finals, Laker star Magic Johnson said he felt so disappointed, in part, because he let down blacks. So many black fans were pulling for him, including, he discovered, many black residents of Boston.As a Los Angeles native, I, too, wanted the Lakers to win. But how did the Lakers of the era become the ""black team"" and how did the Bird-led team become the ""white team""? Sure, the Celtics were led by Bird — a white player — but the Celtics' coach, K.C. Jones, was black, as were several key players, including guards Dennis Johnson and Gerald Henderson, as well as center Robert Parrish and forward Cedric ""Cornbread"" Maxwell. Meanwhile, the Lakers' head coach was Pat Riley, a white man.No doubt many whites pulled for Bird because he's white. As a white friend and Larry Bird fan once told me, ""White people have pride, too."" And no doubt that many black people pulled for Magic Johnson over Bird because Johnson is black. Who cares? Something can be racial without being racist. One black Celtic player said it bothered him that some blacks considered him to be playing for a ""white team."" But another black player, M.L. Carr, said he could not have cared less about the black-versus-white nonsense and just wanted to beat Los Angeles.It's also worth noting that Bird never played into the ""Great White Hope"" nonsense. When an opposing ballplayer, Isiah Thomas, suggested that if Bird were a black player he ""would be just another good guy,"" Bird did not take the bait. He could have fired back and accused the black player of racism. But he wanted nothing to do with what he perceived as a media-made controversy. When the player apologized, Bird accepted it, and that was that. Bird said: ''The main thing is that if the statement doesn't bother me, it shouldn't bother anybody. If Isiah tells me it was a joking matter, it should be left at that. The NBA is sometimes not the easiest thing to be in, and after a game like that, in the heat of the locker room, it's probably not the best time to talk to us. I've answered a lot of questions about it, and talked about it to my family, and they still love Isiah Thomas.""Now how about a little perspective?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersIn 1950, the first black player entered the NBA. The '60s saw the breakout of black superstars like Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Elgin Baylor, Walt Bellamy, Hal Greer and many more. Fast-forward to today. As of 2017, 75% of the roughly 500 players in the NBA are black. Of the 30 coaches in the NBA, eight of them — 27% — are black.Jackie Robinson, the first black baseball player in the modern major leagues, said, he, too, felt pressured to live up to the expectations of black America. He had good reason. There were zero blacks playing in the major leagues at the time he entered in 1947. There was a belief among many whites, and probably blacks, too, that black ballplayers just could not compete against whites. That's pressure.Robinson faced hostility from teammates and opponents, many of whom attempted to physically harm him while playing. At that time, pre-television, baseball — along with boxing and horse racing — occupied a much bigger stage for the attention of the American public. Excruciating pressure was on Robinson, because what he represented and what he meant to millions of black Americans transcended baseball.Because of pioneers like Jackie Robinson, we can now pretty much sit back and just watch a good game. Politics can wait a few hours.During their playing days, Johnson and Bird became good friends. Since their playing days, their friendship has deepened. Bird even stunned Celtics fans when, after a tough loss, Bird — during the post-game press conference — conceded that Johnson was ""the best I've ever seen."" Turns out, when the noise died down, Bird just wanted to beat Johnson, whom he respected as a player and as a man. Johnson just wanted to beat Bird, whom he respected as a player and as a man. And that's how it should be.You might also like...More columns by Larry Elder

""So now I think it's more of a function of can companies walk us through how much better the scenario is today?""Wangler expects guidance on activity and production levels and commentary on whether $50 a barrel will be enough for companies to really start ramping up activity.West Texas intermediate oil has been hovering around $50 a barrel for several weeks after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cap production. Rig counts, especially in the Permian basin, have risen, though the latest week saw the first dip in more than four months, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) data.U.S. oil has retreated from $50 earlier this year and lately has had trouble breaking out higher.

103,HAL,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) warned Friday that it could make the biggest reserves revision since its 1999 merger, if crude prices don't climb higher, as it faces investigations into how it values its assets.The oil major said 3.6 billion barrels of reserves in the Canadian oil sands and another 1 billion barrels in other North American plays could be taken off the books because they aren't profitable at current prices.Exxon noted that such a ""de-booking"" wouldn't affect the actual operation of related projects or change guidance on future production volumes.But the reserves warning comes as Exxon is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Attorney General for not writing down assets, which have lost value during oil's two-year downturn, according to reports last month.While crude prices have recovered recently, momentum has stalled in recent weeks.

105,HAL,"U.S. shale producers were the big winners of OPEC's decision Wednesday to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, but the deal won't immediately fix high debt loads, lack of skilled workers and other issues that shale producers need to resolve before ramping up production.West Texas Intermediate futures rose 3.3% to $51.06 a barrel on Thursday, the highest close since Oct. 19, after jumping 9% the day before. Brent futures rose as high as $54.53, the highest since July 2015.""There were casualties on capital spending  and future capital spending, so even though the war is over and welcomed by everyone, thinking the U.S. producers are going to ramp up production to where they were even a year ago is ill-conceived,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.Domestic crude production has edged up to the highest level in nearly six months, but Flynn thinks it will take a least a year before output really heats up in the U.S.""Companies are going to need more capital from banks, and it will be more difficult to borrow money because they have been burned in the past.""During the downturn, shale firms relied on bank loans or debt and stock sales to keep the lights on and rigs running.ConocoPhillips (COP) has said it would use cash from higher oil prices to first reduce debt before expanding operations. In May, EOG Resources (EOG) said it would first fund capital expenditures with cash flow, reduce net debt with property sales, and then complete drilled but uncompleted wells before starting to drill new wells.But Flynn said Conoco, Occidental Petroleum (OXY)and Oasis Petroleum (OAS) have a lot of capital and should be winners in the shale patch.Finding skilled workers and functioning equipment will be another major hurdle for the industry as rigs were retired or put in storage, and thousands of employees found other jobs after being laid off during the bust.Meanwhile, the latest surge in oil prices still isn't enough for many producers to jump back into the fray.Jason Wangler, managing director Wunderlich, told IBD oil would have to reach $60 per barrel before ""you'll see an absolute rush"" of producers ramping up activity. ""But $50 is a lot better than $40,"" and he expects U.S. shale companies' capital spending to be up 20% to 25% in 2017 vs. 2016.Last month, EOG said the U.S. shale industry needs oil prices of $60 a barrel to ramp up drilling.But Conoco, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN) will be able to boost activity at $50 per barrel, according to research company Wood Mackenzie in a Financial Times article.And costs are going up. Oil field service providers plan to roll back discounts offered during the depths of the price crash. In October, Halliburton (HAL) indicated that it was willing to increase its prices even if it means losing some customers.Still, technological advances have helped Continental Resources (CLR) reduce drilling time in the Bakken, and EOG has found a way to use cheap natural gas in fracking. But an estimated 80% of cost savings during the downturn came from service providers slashing costs.Shares of Continental Resources dipped 0.8% to close at 57.55 on the stock market today, but that's after surging 23% on Wednesday, breaking out of a cup with handle base. Occidental dipped  slightly to 71.27, Oasis ticked up 3 cents to 15. EOG climbed 2.2% to 104.75, above buy range, after jumping 11% Wednesday on the OPEC news. Halliburton added 0.3% to 53.24. Conoco lost 0.6% to 48.22 while Pioneer shares fell 0.8% to 189.57. Devon finished the day down 1% to 47.85.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC's announcement send shale stocks are soaring, see which shale plays are now buys.While rig counts have been rising in the Permian and Colorado's DJ Niobrara basin, Flynn said most of the recent rigs were added to replace rigs in decline or to hold leases.U.S. producers also could be hesitant to ramp up activity as the OPEC deal is contingent on Russia and other nonmembers scaling back output.The certainty of the deal was already in question Wednesday as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak cautioned that Russia will ""gradually"" reduce due to technical issues. OPEC will meet with nonmembers to work out the details on Dec. 9.RELATED: U.S. Crude Production Hits Highest Level In Nearly 6 MonthsDover, Machinery Stocks Soar On Oil Prices, Infrastructure Hopes

Revenue is seen falling 8.9% to $61.34 billion.Chevron's EPS is expected to plunge nearly 70% to 37 cents and revenue is seen down 15.3% to $29.05 billion.""Oil prices were still too low to drive really good results, so I don't think anyone is expecting the companies to perform at the level they want to,"" said Sam Margolin, research analyst at Cowen. ""This quarter isn't going to be big catalyst either way. Most of the focus will be on cost cutting and where their projects are moving.""Downstream refining operations had been a bright spot for integrated companies. Cheap oil typically boosts refining by lowering its input costs, and the downstream unit had cushioned the blow of low prices upstream. But oil prices are on the uptick again, narrowing refining margins.""Downstream will be worse than a year ago,"" Margolin said. ""Last year it was the best year ever for refining. That might be headwind not a lot of people are thinking about.""Exxon shares closed up 0.4% at 87.09 on the stock market today.

In contrast, the S&P 500, up 3.1% last week, lost just 0.1%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell around 0.6% to 113.30. More importantly, the stock held above its key 50-day moving average. And Intel (INTC) helped prop up chipmakers with a 0.7% gain to 35.97. Intel has been working on a new saucerlike base since peaking at 38.36 in October.The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6% on Monday, following last week's 3.6% rally, but volume on fell about 6% vs. Friday's level, according to preliminary data. That's a sign that big funds weren't overly eager to sell positions and raise cash.The NYSE composite outperformed by losing just 0.1%. Big Board turnover grew. The S&P 500 was also off just 0.1% while mega-cap names were virtually flat. Due to the small declines, the 500 avoided getting tagged with a new distribution day, or bout of heavy professional selling. The distribution count on the 500 is now at 2, down from 8 on Nov. 1, according to the IBD Market Pulse table found in each daily Big Picture column.A low distribution day count implies that large funds, banks, pension plans and the like are accumulating shares on net. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating on the S&P 500 is positive at C+ as of Friday's close.The S&P 100 was up a fraction while the Dow Jones industrials edged 0.2% ahead.Oil and gas royalty trust, oil drilling, and international oil and gas exploration companies paced the upside with gains of 1% or more. IBD's Medical-Diversified group, which includes Dow 30 component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and the Internet-Network Solutions group also excelled with gains of 2% and 1%, respectively.J&J jumped nearly 3% to 115.36 in heavy turnover, stopping short of retaking its 50- and 200-day lines. The stock is just 8% below a 52-week peak, but it's still in the early stages of forming a potential new base.The worst declines in terms of industry groups belonged to department store chains (down more than 4%), airlines (-3%), leisure products (-3%) and steel production (off more than 2%). Southwest bank, cement and aggregate, security software and consumer loan companies also sold off hard.Back to the tech sector, Microsoft (MSFT) rose 0.3% to 62.17, extending its gains from a breakout past a 58.80 base-on-base buy point to 5.7%. The mega cap is now slightly extended past the 5% proper buying range.Qualcomm (QCOM), which makes the IBD Dividend Leaders screen, gave up little ground as it builds on gains since a July 21 breakaway gap past a bottoming base buy point of 56.37. Yet the stock may also be working on a new flat-base-like structure. Qualcomm was also showcased in today's The Income Investor column.Netflix (NFLX) continues to show tight action after a strong rally last week. Down just 5 cents on Monday to 122.83, the video streaming giant is still above an aggressive entry point near 120, according to IBD Leaderboard. The standard buy point is 129.39.In the energy sector, numerous oil and gas explorers struggled to hold big opening gains in the wake of another surprise agreement among non-OPEC oil-producing nations to join in the body's historic decision to cut overall production starting in January.Britain's integrated oil major BP (BP) rallied more than 1% to 36.51, at one point getting as high as 36.96, or just a few cents above a 36.93 cup buy point. The eight-week cup sits within a much longer and deeper bottoming base pattern. Halliburton (HAL) ran up to a session high of 56.08 before sinking back to 54.49, up just 0.5%. The oilfield services giant, however, has climbed more than 16% since clearing a 47 flat-base buy point in early October.At one point, Halliburton pulled back below the 47 entry to an intraday low of 45.08, but that 4% drop was not enough to trigger the 8% loss-cutting sell rule following a good breakout.Wall Street sees Halliburton reversing from a net loss of 5 cents a share in 2016 to a net profit of $1.03 a share in 2017.The week features only a sliver of companies reporting quarterly results, but they include two major big-cap software names, Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The latter is expected to grow fourth-quarter profit 39% to 86 cents a share. Over the prior six quarters, earnings have grown on average 53.2%.In August, Adobe pushed past a 100.66 flat-base entry point and rallied more than 10% before fading. Yet in its most recent correction, the stock found bullish support at the long-term 200-day moving average. Watch to see if the stock can hurdle its 50-day moving average, which would boost the odds of a fresh breakout.Besides the upcoming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates on Wednesday, keep an eye out for the November report on producer level prices.

112,HAL,"Shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) said OPEC is losing its relevance as the U.S.'s expanding shale exploration efforts is making .Meanwhile, Carrizo Oil and Gas (CRZO) reported a surprise rise in third-quarter profit Thursday, while Apache's (APA) loss wasn't as bad as analysts feared. Plus, EOG Resources (EOG) is on tap after the market closes.During Continental's third-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Harold Hamm said no matter what the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries does at its meeting later this month, ""markets are at a turning point"" and that U.S. shale has made the cartel ""less relevant."" But earlier this week Goldman Sachs (GS) warned that oil prices could hit the low $40s per barrel if an OPEC agreement fails.U.S. crude fell 1.5% to $44.66 a barrel on Wednesday, its lowest close since Sept. 23.Despite current volatility in oil prices, Continental said it expects a ""a very strong"" 2017 but won't give full-year guidance until January. The company said more than 50% of the cost savings it's seeing is from operational restructuring and will stay with the company as it looks to complete drilled but uncompleted wells in the Bakken shale play in North Dakota.IBD'S TAKE: Continental is talking a bullish game about 2017 but oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell are taking more cautious capital expenditure outlooks for 2017.The company also said it bundled services for greater efficiencies and plans to continue negotiating packages as service providers look at raising prices. Earlier Halliburton (HAL) said it is still in a ""brawl"" on pricing with competitors.Late Wednesday Continental reported third-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street views. Continental shares fell 1.8% to 46.17 in the stock market today.Among shale producers that issued quarterly results Thursday, Carrizo's earnings jumped 15% to 23 cents a share, beating analyst views by 6 cents. But revenue fell 29.8% to $111.8 million. The company's overall oil and gas production rose 13% on strong results from assets in the Eagle Ford formation and Delaware Basin while oil production rose 4%.Carrizo raised its full-year oil production outlook to 25,350-25,500 barrels per day up from an earlier outlook of 25,150-25,400 barrels per day, due to increased production from its acquisition in the Eagle Ford from an affiliate of Sanchez Energy (SN). The company said it would add a third full time rig in early 2017 for use in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin.Shares jumped 3.55% to 34.41.Apache's per-share loss was only 3 cents vs. the 16 cents analysts were expecting and revenue also topped views.During the quarter, the company announced the discovery of the Alpine High play in the Delaware Basin. The mountainous region had previously been dismissed by hydraulic fracturing experts but Apache plans to spend more than a quarter of its $2 billion 2016 capital spending budget on the play.Apache said it will add three rigs in the Midland Basin in Q4 and would end the year at the high end of its North American onshore production guidance of 268,000-278,000 barrels per day.But shares plunged 6.6% to 55.52.EOG Resources late Thursday announced that it lost 35 cents a share, or 40 cents excluding various items. Revenue fell to $2.12 billion. Analysts had expected EOG swinging to a loss of 31 cents a share, with revenue down 11.1% to $1.93 billion.EOG raised its 2016 capital spending guidance and upped its 2020 production growth targets.EOG rose 2.3% to 94.20 late after closing up 1.25% to 92.08.RELATED: Biggest-Ever U.S. Oil Stockpile Jump Sends Price Back To $45

113,HAL,"Shares of Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) broke out into buy range Monday, helped by a rally in oil prices, with rival Schlumberger (SLB) closing in on its own entry point.U.S. crude jumped 3.1% to settle at $51.35 per barrel, the highest finish since July 2015. Brent was up 2.3% to $53.14, also the highest in more than a year. Providers of oilfield services are expected to be the early beneficiaries of the oil rally.Halliburton shares climbed 2.2% to close at 47.26 in the stock market today, breaking out of a cup base with a 47 buy point. Baker Hughes rose 1% to $53.35, topping a 52.93 buy point from a flat base.The uptick in oil prices comes as top producers met in Istanbul to discuss the production cuts agreed on last month. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cap production at 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day, down from the cartel's daily production of 33.2 million barrels at the end of August. Details on who will cut and how much will be decided at OPEC's official meeting in November.As OPEC cuts back, U.S. drilling is expected to increase next year. Rigs in operation will average 579 for 2017, up 29% from what's expected this year, according to a study out last month by Platts RigData, a forecasting unit of S&P Global Platts. Analysts forecast 11,151 new wells to be drilled next year, up 25% from the 8,915 wells expected this year.IBD'S TAKE: Oilfield service providers aren't the only stocks breaking out this Columbus Day. Broadcom joins Facebook, Zimmer Biomet and a lesser-known Chinese IPO on a list of stocks exploring new buy zones. Earlier this year, Baker Hughes and Halliburton called off their merger; the merged company would have overtaken Schlumberger as the world's largest provider of oilfield services.Meanwhile, Schlumberger stock is still in a cup with a 84.07 buy point.

Among shale producers, Continental Resources (CLR) edged 0.25% lower and Diamondback Energy (FANG) dipped less than 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Shale stocks like EOG, Concho and Pioneer Natural are making gains heading into buy range or extending above buy range as oil prices bounce around $50 per barrel. While rig counts in the U.S. have been on the rise, on its Q3 conference call this week, Halliburton (HAL) CEO Dave Lesar maintained that ""significant activity increases start with sustainable commodity prices of over $50 per barrel.""Lesar also said that while the industry can see ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" and U.S. unconventional drilling was leading the oil price recovery, the market is still ""very challenging.""He doesn't see North American drilling picking up in Q4, due to downtime and closures caused by seasonal weather and the holidays.Both Halliburton and Schlumberger (SLB), which reported earnings late Thursday, signaled that they'll focus on profits over market share as pricing for oil services remains difficult.Halliburton shares ended 0.7% lower but still in buy range from Wednesday's breakout.

Volume in the stock market today ran slightly higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE.Oil stocks were among the day's best performers. Five of the day's top 10 gainers among industry groups were from the oil patch. Big gainers in the sector included contract driller Transocean (RIG), up 6%; drilling services provider Halliburton (HAL), up 3%; wellbore products provider Baker Hughes (BHI), up 3%; and oil and gas explorer Resolute Energy (REN), up 17%.The Energy Information Administration reported that crude oil stockpiles fell for a fifth consecutive week, catching the Street by surprise. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose 2% to just under $50 a barrel.In the IBD 50, a list of the best stocks by fundamentals and technicals, winners and losers were about evenly matched. The day's biggest gainer was Acacia Communications (ACIA), up 10%. Acacia raised earnings guidance for the second time in less than two weeks. The worst performer was Gigamon (GIMO), down 6%. Two investment banks downgraded Gigamon.Three economic reports helped set the market's upbeat tone. Factory orders for August, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing gauge for September, and U.S. Services PMI for September each topped the Street's consensus number.A fourth report disappointed.

116,HAL,"General Electric (GE) and Baker Hughes (BHI) said Monday that they will combine their oil and gas operations. Unlike the failed Baker Hughes merger with Halliburton (HAL), analysts say this deal will pass regulators.GE shareholders will own 62.5% of the ""new"" Baker Hughes, while Baker Hughes shareholders will own 37.5% and receive a one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share.The deal will add 4 cents per share to GE's earnings by 2018 and 8 cents by 2020.GE CEO Jeff Immelt will be the chairman of the new company and Lorenzo Simonelli,  CEO of GE Oil & Gas, will be CEO. Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead will be vice chairman.General Electric shares fell 12 cents to 29.10 at the close the stock market today after rising to 29.65 early. Baker Hughes stock, which initially popped to 62.16, reversed and tumbled 6.3% to 55.40. That erased virtually all of Friday's 8.4% pop after GE confirmed it was in talks with Baker Hughes.The GE deal comes after a failed Halliburton takeover bid that ended earlier this year after the Justice Department filed suit to block the deal on antitrust grounds.""There's not really any significant overlap,"" said Robin Shoemaker, equity research analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""I don't think there is much for the DOJ to object to here.""Halliburton shares fell 1.3% to 46.Crude oil futures weren't helping energy stocks. U.S. crude closed down 3.8% to $46.86 a barrel, extending last week's big drop as OPEC and big oil producers failed to agree on specific production curbs for individual countries. That raised doubts about whether a deal will take place in late November as planned.Despite the downturn in oil prices, GE has been focused on expanding its oil and gas and industrial operations after shedding most of its GE Capital assets.""They've made some acquisitions in a much stronger oil-price environment, so now was an opportunity to make their largest acquisitions close to the low point in the business cycle.

117,HAL,"Record high oil production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in October added to skepticism that members will figure out a way later this month to reduce their combined output, hammering crude prices and shares of oil companies Friday.OPEC increased production last month by 240,000 barrels per day to 33.64 million barrels per day, the cartel reported Friday. In September, OPEC agreed to cut production to 32.5 million-33 million barrels a day in November.The biggest production increases came from Libya, Nigeria, Iraq and Iran — four members that want to be exempt from the cuts. Iran had been the stumbling block for prior output agreements, as Tehran has rejected calls to freeze production until it rises to presanction levels.Brent futures closed 2.4% lower at $44.75 per barrel. U.S. crude tumbled 2.8% to settle at $43.41 a barrel, capping a third straight weekly decline. For the past year, U.S. prices have failed to stay consistently above $50, as that level has triggered more drilling and production, weighing on prices.Exxon Mobil (XOM) was down 1.6% to close at 85.67 on the stock market today. BP (BP) fell 2.2% to 33.18. Chevron (CVX) was off 1.1% to 106.64. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) tumbled 3.7% to 49.28, dipping below its 200-day average.Brazil's state run oil company Petrobras (PBR) plunged 5.9% to 9.73, falling below its 50-day line, after reporting a surprise loss in the third quarter and cutting the value of its oilfields and other assets. Donald Trump's victory also weighed on Latin American stocks.Top U.S. shale exploration and production companies were also down on Friday. Continental Resources (CLR) tumbled 4% to 45.40. EOG Resources (EOG) fell 1.3% to 91.41, dropping under its 50-day line as it tries to build a flat base. Diamondback Energy (FANG) was down 1.9% to 95.49, right at its 50-day line.Among oilfield service providers, new issue Mammoth Energy Services (TUSK) reversed from negative ground, gaining 2.2% to close at 13.74. Halliburton (HAL) was off 1.6% 48.01, but remained in buy range.IBD'S TAKE: OPEC said global oil demand could peak by 2029 if the Paris climate agreement is fully executed. But a Trump victory throws the accord in doubt and is bullish for U.S. shale exploration and production companies. Even before OPEC's latest production increase, it was seen waffling on actually implementing a cut at its meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.The cartel also faces rising U.S. production, and President-elect Donald Trump has been a proponent of boosting U.S. output by opening up federal land for drilling.The election sent crude prices on a wild ride this week. In the initial aftermath of the upset win, oil tumbled but then rallied on hopes for looser drilling rules, but retreated again as U.S. oil inventories showed another gain. For the week, West Texas Intermediate lost 1.5%.Meanwhile, the added oil on the market is further outstripping demand, which OPEC said will average 32.69 million barrels per day next year. That represents a surplus of 950,000 per day if the group keeps production at current levels, up from an estimated 800,000 barrels per day in OPEC's September report.On Thursday, the International Energy Agency said it sees global demand growth at 1.2 million barrels per day in 2017, the same increase as it forecasts for this year, after climbing by 1.8 million barrels per day in 2015.RELATED: Total, CNPC To Win $6 Billion Iran Gas Deal Years After Sanctions Pushed Them OutU.S. Oil Rig Counts Up By 2 On Increased Eagle Ford Drilling

119,HAL,"General Electric (GE) said late Thursday that it's in talks with oil services firm Baker Hughes (BHI) about an alliance, but not an outright purchase.""We are in discussion with Baker Hughes,"" GE spokeswoman Deidre Latour said in a statement. ""While nothing is concluded, none of these options include an outright purchase.""That following media reports, initially from the Wall Street Journal, citing sources that General Electric had approached Baker Hughes.GE could merge its oil-and-gas business with Baker Hughes, creating a stronger competitor Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL), the No. 1 and No. 2 oil services firms.Baker Hughes rose 8.4% to 59.12 on the stock market today. General Electric, which set an eight-month closing low on Thursday, climbed 2.1% to 29.22.Baker Hughes had broken out of a base on Tuesday, hitting a 52-week high after reporting a smaller-than-expected loss. With oil prices rising, demand for oil services is rising. But Halliburton and Schlumberger have said pricing remains tough and that they will prioritize profits over market share.Halliburton in 2014 agreed to buy Baker Hughes for 78.62 a share, or $35 billion. But the ended their merger efforts earlier this year after the Justice Department filed suit to block the deal on antitrust grounds.Halliburton stock fell 2% while Schlumberger lost 0.5%.General Electric had been seen as a possible buyer of assets from Halliburton and Baker Hughes as the energy firms sought to win over regulators.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric and a slew of other industrial giants have given weak outlooks in recent weeks amid a strong dollar and a weak global economic environment.GE has been shifting away from finance and re-emphasizing its industrial roots. Last week GE topped Q3 earnings views but revenue fell short and the company cut its organic sales growth target.Baker Hughes on Friday will release weekly figures on the U.S. oil rigs in operation. That's been steadily rising in recent months.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) reported better-than-expected earnings Friday, but sales fell short.RELATED:GE Cuts Revenue View After Q3 Miss But Sees Strong-Dollar Drag Easing

X IBD's unique RS Rating measures market leadership by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that indicates how a stock's price action over the trailing 52 weeks compares to the rest of the market. History reveals that the market's biggest winners often have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if Keane can continue to rebound and clear that threshold. Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineThe stock, which is on theIPO Leaders list broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 19.64 entry from a cup with handle. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new pattern to take shape. Also keep in mind that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. Earnings grew 108% last quarter, up from 0% in the prior report. Revenue also increased, from 253% to 309%. Keane earns the No. 9 rank among its peers in the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry group.

121,HAL,"So far this year, cyclical industries such as oil suppliers, fertilizer, transport and steelmakers are leading IBD's 197 industry stock groups. That reflects confidence in the U.S. and global economy as well as benefits from the Trump tax cuts. The corporate tax cuts are likely to benefit energy and other old-economy sectors more than tech giants that can more easily avoid taxes.X While 2018 has barely gotten started, most of these groups have been top performers over the past several weeks. Investors need to be watching for sector rotations so they are always focusing on the leading groups and stocks.Many of the stocks in these groups are either extended from breakouts (FedEx (FDX), U.S. Steel (X)) or still recovering from long downtrends (Schlumberger (SLB)). But a few, including steelmaker Nucor (NUE) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM), are in or near buy range.S&P 500 futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.3%. Dow futures advanced 0.2%.The Chemicals-Agriculture group has soared 13% so far in 2018. This includes fertilizer makers such as CF Industries (CF).But Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile, which makes specialty fertilizers, is also now seen as a lithium play. Sociedad Química y Minera has a 63.90 buy point, closing Wednesday at 61.81. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is lagging somewhat after a strong three-month uptrend to late September.Mining giant Rio Tinto (RIO) reportedly has dropped out of the bidding for a 32% SQM stake owned by Nutrien (NTR), Bloomberg reported late Wednesday, citing sources. Fertilizer giant Nutrien, formed from the merger of Potash Corp. and Agrium, agreed to sell the SQM holdings to win regulatory approval.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) is now viewed as an indirect legal marijuana play.This group is up 8.7% this year. Group giants include Schlumberger and Halliburton (HAL). Crude oil prices have risen to three-year highs above $63 a barrel in the U.S. But oil services stocks were slower to rebound than many shale producers as customers remained reluctant to step up spending. Both Schlumberger  and Halliburton on working on the right side of long, deep consolidations.This related energy group has climbed 8% in 2018. Notable members include Baker Hughes, a General Electric Co. (BHGE).This small group, dominated by FedEx and UPS (UPS), has rallied 8% as well. FedEx and UPS stocks are extended.Steelmakers have climbed 7.9% this year. Steel stocks were among the big immediate winners after President Trump's election, but then made little headway for most of 2017 before moving higher in Q4. U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics (STLD) are extended, but Nucor is just in range from a 66.10 entry in a consolidation going back nearly 10 months.

125,HAL,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

126,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) is still in a ""brawl"" on pricing with competitors, despite the recent rebound in crude and drilling activity, and signaled Wednesday it's open to increasing its prices even if it means losing some customers.The oilfield services provider and rivals like Schlumberger (SLB) slashed the prices they charged during the depths of the oil bust. As oil headed back up this year, they indicated such discounts would be taken back.But Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar said on a conference call that while the industry can see ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" and unconventional drilling was leading the oil price recovery, the market is still ""very challenging.""The company doesn't expect activity in North America to increase in Q4 as customer activity is typically lower on holiday- and weather-related closures. Lesar said some customers were delaying drilling ramp-ups until Q1. By then, they could see higher prices.""We have the highest market share that we've ever had in the U.S.,"" Lesar said. ""If we have to give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach.""Halliburton reported Q3 earnings per share of a penny vs. analysts' views for a loss of 7 cents, prompting Lesar to say, ""I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit.""Revenue sank 31% to $3.83 billion, below views for $3.89 billion. Operating margin jumped to 3.3% from 0.8% a year ago.Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai said Halliburton should see pricing improvements on services in North America in Q4 or Q1, but it could be a year before prices rise internationally.""Schlumberger mentioned previously that in some of their contracts they had an oil price slider,"" he told IBD. ""They gave a lot of discounts, but if oil prices improved they had to get better pricing. I think there is a similar case at Halliburton.""Halliburton shares were up 4.25% to 49.07 on the stock market today, gapping up above buying range after bobbing above and below its entry point for the last week.

Baker Hughes (BHI) rallied 2.4% to 52.83, closing just below a 52.93 pivot after breaking out last week.Also adding momentum to shares in the energy sector was a rally in oil prices, helped by a drop in U.S. crude inventories.IBD'S TAKE: Oilfield service providers are expected to be the first in the oil patch to see stock gains as oil prices increase. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes are near buy range as oil bounces around $50. Desai, who now sees Halliburton breaking even in Q4 vs. a prior view of a loss of 10 cents a share, said the oil price needed for renewed activity has been falling, but doesn't expect it to fall much below $50 per barrel as drilling-improvement gains are maxed out.On the conference call, Lesar maintained that ""significant activity increases starts with sustainable commodity prices of over $50 per barrel.""Schlumberger reports Thursday.

133,HAL,"Oil gushed to its best level in months in October, cracking the keenly watched, $50-per-barrel level and rewarding energy bulls who have defied weak fundamentals to pour billions into ETFs in this sector.Energy has outpaced the other S&P 500 sectors year to date through Oct. 13, jumping 18.7% while the broad market as reflected in SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is up 6.1%.Several exchange traded funds in this sector are among the best-performing ETFs of 2016.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) saw $1.14 billion in net inflow over the first three quarters, helping it grow assets by 35% since the start of the year to a current $15.46 billion.The fund is a cheap and efficient way to gain exposure to the energy sector of the S&P 500. About two-thirds of its assets are in oil majors such as Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and Halliburton (HAL).Traders love its liquidity, making it a popular choice for betting on this volatile sector.Several of its peers have rewarded investors more handsomely so far this year. Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Energy (RYE) has vaulted 27.8%.It holds the same stocks as XLE but gives each an equal stake of portfolio assets. In XLE, the biggest stocks by market capitalization get a much bigger weight.So RYE benefited more from the big moves by smaller players such as Oneok (OKE), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Spectra Energy (SE). Shares of Oneok, an oil and gas pipeline company, have more than doubled year to date on the back of strong profit growth.Some experts see a brighter outlook for oil, due to an unexpected plan among major oil-producing nations to cut production and a surprisingly big drop in U.S. stockpiles.""We see less risk of a renewed oil price plunge and the potential for a gradual rise toward long-term equilibrium levels around $60 per barrel, where supply and demand are likely to find a better balance,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote Oct. 10.But crude has crumbled in the past three years, and risks remain. Among them, the OPEC plan that triggered oil's latest rally is, for now, just talk.So ETF investors may want to consider tilting toward quality and low-cost producers, according to BlackRock.Quality companies boast low leverage, strong profits and consistent earnings. And low-cost companies are able to extract oil at a lower marginal cost than more expensive oil regions — certain shale plays, for example.Mega oil majors fit the quality, low-cost bill, says Tushar Yadava, an investment strategist at BlackRock. He points out that these industry giants derive revenue from multiple avenues and are less sensitive to the price of the underlying commodity. They enjoy a lower breakeven price and better profit margins.The $1.11 billion iShares Global Energy (IXC) has 40% of its assets in the world's largest producers. The fund's top five stock holdings include Exxon Mobil and Chevron, as well as France's Total (TOT) and the United Kingdom's BP (BP).The U.S. accounts for a 59% portfolio weight, the U.K. 14% and France 6%.IXC is up 19.5% year to date, outstripping XLE, but has lagged its larger peer in the longer term.Over the past 10 years, IXC produced an average annual gain of 2.1% vs. 4.6% for XLE.Despite a better outlook for oil, ETF investors should proceed with caution in the energy sector.Yadava wants to see more than improved cash flow from better commodity prices. He's looking for ""a turning point"" in earnings, revenue and estimate growth, and that is still some way off, he told IBD in an email.United States Oil (USO), a commodity ETF investing in near-month WTI futures, scored its fourth weekly advance in a row on the stock market today.

134,HAL,"Oilfield service providers Baker Hughes (BHGE), Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL) led a surge in energy-sector stocks Monday as crude prices jumped to the highest levels in more than two years.XWest Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, rallied 3.1% to settle at $57.35, the highest since July 2015.Baker Hughes, which merged earlier this year with GE's (GE) oil and gas unit, also said Monday it will buy back up to $3 billion of its common units, adding that its strong balance sheet positions it well to invest in growth.""Today's announcement represents an important step in our plan to optimize BHGE's capital structure,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli.The news followed BP's (BP) announcement last week that it would resume buybacks, and Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) strong quarterly report that raised hopes for more shareholder returns. After years of conserving cash amid historically low prices, oil companies are raising expectations among investors that capital deployment is starting to return to normal.Shares of Baker Hughes spiked 8.8% to 33.92 on the stock market today. Schlumberger jumped 5.5%, retaking its 50-day moving average, and Halliburton rose 4.3%.Those gains outpaced BP's 2.1% advance and Shell's 2.2% gain, with Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) seeing increases of 0.7% and 1.8%, respectively. Meanwhile, bellwether shale producers like EOG Resources (EOG) and Continental Resources (CLR) were up 2.35% and 3.7%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Watch for new technologies and efficiencies from the top U.S. oil producers as they try to get around price hikes from service providers Halliburton and Schlumberger.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said Monday that Baker Hughes has strong cash flow capability and could even increase its dividend and buy back more stock in the future.""The merger of Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas has created a new heavyweight in the oilfield services sector,"" RBC's Kurt Hallead and David Lu wrote. ""We believe most investors will view BHGE as an energy conglomerate given its exposure throughout the value chain.""Until today, oilfield service stocks largely sat out the energy rally since the start of September.

135,HAL,"The Nasdaq composite shuffled mildly lower at lunchtime in New York as most of the FAANG stocks slumped. But the Dow Jones industrial average edged higher, rising around 0.1% despite a 4% slide by General Electric (GE). Three of the Dow 30 stocks climbed 1 point or more, including Apple (AAPL), Home Depot (HD) and new medical-sector breakout Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).XGE reported disappointing Q3 results on Friday as adjusted earnings sharply missed views. But revenue climbed 14% to $33.47 billion, marking the first top-line increase in four quarters.J&J catapulted past a 137.18 flat-base buy point after reporting double-digit earnings and sales growth for Q3 last week. The 5% buy zone goes up to 144.04.At 1pm ET, the Nasdaq cut its loss to 0.1%; the PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, was also down around 0.1%.The S&P 500 was flat as gains in retail, building and wood products, medical, and select computer-related shares offset sharp losses in the toy, internet content, airline, media, homebuilder, and oil and gas machinery industry groups. Volume is running a tad higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Friday.Breadth is negative on both exchanges. Losing stocks exceeded winners by a more than 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.Halliburton (HAL) weighed on the oil sector, falling as much as 2.2% before shaving some losses and bouncing off its 50-day moving average. The company reported third-quarter earnings of 42 cents a share vs. a penny in the year-ago quarter on an adjusted basis. Revenue jumped 42% to $5.44 billion, marking a second quarter of accelerating growth. Revenue rose 2% in Q1 and 29% in Q2.Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller said in a news release that its North American business ""is hitting on all cylinders"" while the international side has ""proved resilient.""WTI crude oil prices, currently near $51.85 a barrel, have rebounded 22% since bottoming near $42.53 in late June.Notice on a daily chart how the oil and gas field services giant is forming a new base, but the base still has a lot of work left. The base began in late January when Halliburton topped at 58.78, then dived below the 50-day moving average on Feb. 16.IBD's TAKE: The 50-day moving average is drawn in red in both IBD daily charts and on MarketSmith, IBD's premium charting and stock screening service.

Read this column in Investor's Corner to learn more about how the 50-day line is a great tool for determining the right time to sell a good stock.Also in the energy sector, Argentine oil and gas explorer YPF (YPF) cleared a 23.32 buy point in a long cup-with-handle pattern. The 5% buy zone extends to 24.49.The company is aggressively pursuing fracking and horizontal drilling opportunities. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings of 62 cents a share this year and $1.44 a share in 2018, a 132% leap.The latest base passes the midpoint test; that is, the midpoint of the handle is higher than the midpoint of the base. Yet shares are still building the right side of the cup. The cup's left-side high is 26.48.At 24, YPF is still nearly 10% off that cup's left-side high.Volume is running at triple normal levels. The average daily volume is currently 929,000 shares over the prior 50 trading sessions. YPF's integrated oil industry group is a market laggard, still dwelling in the bottom half of IBD's 197 industry groups. But group mate Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) has been hitting 52-week highs lately.Returning to Apple, the stock resisted the Nasdaq's slide, edging nearly 0.8% higher to 157.47 in light trade. While the stock is back near an Aug. 2 breakout point at 156.75 from a flat base, the iPhone giant is forming a new base with a 165.04 buy point.The stock's weekly chart shows Apple remains a leader and is still carving out a long-term uptrend.Apple, which reports fiscal Q4 results on Nov. 2, has gained 39% after breaking out of a bottoming base on Jan. 6-9. That base was a cup with handle, featuring a 118.12 entry.The Street is expecting long-term acceleration in Apple's fundamentals, a key factor for the stock's market-beating rise so far this year.Earnings are seen rising 8% for all of fiscal 2017 (ended in September) to $9.01 a share, then grow 23% to $11.09 a share in FY 2019 as sales pick up 6% to $227.5 billion and 17% to $265.6 billion.The iPhone giant is expected to begin selling its ultraluxury iPhone X later this week, but analysts have been noting component shortages and production bottlenecks are likely going to make it very difficult for consumers to purchase the $999 smartphone soon.Apple is reportedly meeting with officials at outsourcing manufacturer Foxconn to discuss the issue.First Solar (FSLR) rose more than 2.6% to 48.98. Volume is running mildly above average. The solar power systems supplier to utilities broke out of a deep bottoming base last summer and tried to break out past a 50.31 buy point in September. Since then, the Tempe, Ariz., midcap stock has encountered stiff resistance near 50 for weeks.Earnings are expected to plunge 56% to $2.21 a share this year, then fall an additional 42% to $1.28 in 2018. Revenue is seen rising 4% this year, but then falling 24% in 2018.First Solar's RS Rating is a respectable 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in timesaving IBD tool Stock Checkup.In the IBD 50, longtime member TAL Education (TAL) slid more than 2% in fast turnover, but shares remain above the 50-day moving average.

137,HAL,"Baker Hughes (BHGE) is reportedly looking to resume takeover talks with Subsea 7, a U.K.-based company that offers construction and engineering services to the offshore energy industry, after the talks broke down earlier.XNegotiations between Baker Hughes, which was formed by the merger of GE's (GE) oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, and Subsea 7 had collapsed over price but could resume, sources told The Wall Street Journal. Subsea 7 said it would not comment on speculation or rumors, but its shares rose on the news, Reuters added.Baker Hughes, officially known as Baker Hughes, a GE Company, is 62.5% owned by GE, with Baker Hughes shareholders owning the rest.Morningstar analyst Preston Caldwell called the prospective merger odd, noting Subsea 7 has long been a partner with rival Schlumberger (SLB) and would presumably end that relationship if a deal is realized.A combined Baker Hughes-Subsea company also would still have gaps in subsea equipment, he added, warning that those holes should be filled before entering the engineering, procurement, and construction business.BHGE closed down 1.7% at 34.39 on the stock market today. GE gave up 1.2% to 23.07, pegging a fresh 52-week low as Wall Street analysts warn that the industrial giant is fundamentally challenged and its prized dividend could be at risk.Rival oilfield-service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger rose 1.1% and fell 0.9%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is getting underway in earnest. Here's a list of Dow stocks in or near buy points ahead of third-quarter results, including one of GE's industrial peers. The oilfield services industry is consolidating amid the need for greater scale to grow and as oil prices have crashed since 2014.Helix Energy Solutions (HLX) and Dover (DOV) are also said to be exploring strategic sales of all or part of their businesses.Meanwhile, analysts are said to be in wait-and-see mode as to whether Baker Hughes can deliver hoped-for synergies from the merger with GE, and compete effectively with Halliburton and Schlumberger.Amid a slew of executive and board changes this month, GE announced Oct. 2 that Lorenzo Simonelli, president and CEO of BHGE, would succeed Immelt as chairman of BHGE.RELATED:Why GE Stock May Get Worse Instead Of Better As Leadership Turns OverDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisDow Leads Slim Gains; Oil Giant Breaks Out To Buy Point As Crude Soars

It closed 0.7% lower.XLE sits 7% below its early September high and USO 37% below its 52-week high.On Tuesday, one market intelligence firm gave a thumbs down to the troubled energy sector while noting demand for energy ETFs remains strong, with global inflow of $3 billion year to date through Sept. 23.Stewart Glickman, head of energy equity research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, sees negative fundamentals in this sector. These include growing crude inventories and an expanding rig count that could further weaken oil prices, as well as stretched valuations in many energy companies. The latter concern is especially noteworthy in the oil and gas equipment and services sub-industry, according to S&P Global analysts.Their sell recommendations include Core Laboratories (CLB), Halliburton (HAL), Superior Energy Services (SPN) and Weatherford (WFT).S&P Global's Todd Rosenbluth noted that iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services (IEZ) and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services (XES) have as much as 80% of their assets in this energy sub-industry, while XLE allocates 16% of assets to companies that provide oil and gas equipment and services.S&P Global ""recommends investors have an underweighted stake in the sector"" and has underweight rankings on the narrowly focused IEZ and XES, according to Rosenbluth, the firm's director of ETF research.Rosenbluth questioned whether demand for energy ETFs is warranted.But he added in a note: ""We think energy exposure can be appealing in a diversified ETF"" such as XLE and iShares Core High Dividend (HDV).HDV has a 20% stake in energy companies.IBD'S TAKE: Oil majors are on the rebound, but the more nimble U.S. exploration and production companies are outperforming them.

142,HAL,"Call it the industrials revolution. After dominating the sector fund universe for much of this year, techs and biotechs are being dethroned by energy and other industrials.XRising oil futures boosted energy stocks and funds in September, though prices have slipped this month.The accompanying table shows the top sector ETFs for the past month handily outperforming the S&P 500. But nearly all have lagged the benchmark index by a wide margin over the long haul. Only one, Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT), produced an average annual return that beat the S&P 500 over the past three years.Eleven of the 13 funds shown are oil and gas plays. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services (XES) led with a 20.2% gain for the past month through Oct. 3, according to Morningstar Direct. It retook its 50-day moving average Sept. 12 after spending most of the prior seven months below the support line. Shares are 34% off their 52-week high.The $334.2 million fund, launched in June 2006, aims to provide exposure to small-, mid- and big-cap companies. It tracks the S&P Oil & Gas Equipment & Services Select Industry Index. Top holdings as of Oct. 5 included Fairmount Santrol Holdings (FMSA), Ensco (ESV) and Transocean (RIG). The top five names represented 19% of assets.Up next is iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services (IEZ), with a 15.4% one-month return. Its price action looks similar to XES. The 11-year-old fund, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Equipment & Services Index, has gathered $196.4 million.IBD'S TAKE: On the hunt for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.IEZ's top names were Schlumberger (SLB), at 16% of assets, Halliburton (HAL) 10%, and Baker Hughes (BHGE) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) at about 6% each. The portfolio contained 34 stocks; the top five holdings accounted for 43% of assets. IEZ offers a hefty annualized dividend: 3.4% vs. the S&P 500's 1.9%.VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH), with $1.3 billion in assets, and $2.3 billion SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) came in third and fourth with respective one-month returns of 14.3% and 12.2%. These two are among the biggest energy sector ETFs. Further down the list are $16.7 billion Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and $3.9 billion Vanguard Energy (VDE).LIT, mentioned above, came in fifth with a one-month return of 12%.

144,HAL,"You can learn a lot about a stock mutual fund manager's investment approach by scanning how much of a fund's assets he puts into each sector. Those extra bets point to where the manager thinks he'll find stocks that can outperform the stock market.Take the $7.6 billion American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX). The fund's 5.02% return this year going into Thursday topped 73% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. They averaged 3.42%, while the S&P 500 was up 8.29%. The fund's 3.28% average annual gain over the past 12 months beat 83% of its peers, which averaged 0.37%. The big-cap bogey gained 6.14%.Solid returns stem from stock selection rather than sector bets, managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown tell shareholders in their quarterly commentary.The fund's sector overweights are fairly modest, but they still show where the managers are looking for individual companies with strong prospects.Their largest outsized bets vs. the fund's benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index, were in information technology and energy, overweight by 2.78 and 1.29 percentage points, respectively, as of June 30, according to American Century.So far this year, the fund's energy stocks, Concho Resources (CXO) and Halliburton (HAL), are up 43% and 32%, respectively. Their weak IBD Composite Ratings of 51 and 32 and weak SMR Ratings of E and D reflect the effects on earnings of a long descent for oil prices over the past two years. But crude oil appears to have bottomed in the February and has rallied anew in the past three weeks. Both stocks are near 52-week highs, with improving Relative Strength lines.The fund's tech names carry higher ratings. They include top-10 holdings like Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Alphabet is up 4% this year. Earnings per share have climbed between 17% and 28% for five straight quarters. Trading around 806, shares are extended past a double-bottom basing pattern.Alphabet stock has a Composite Rating of 98. Earnings grew at a 14% average annual rate over the past five years.Facebook is up 19% so far this year. Trading around 124, shares are in a buy range from a 121.18 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: Like Amazon, Facebook is on IBD's Leaderboard of highly rated stocks with the potential to move higher.Facebook's EPS growth sped up over the past four quarters. Earnings grew 16%, 33%, 46%, 83% and 94% over the respective past five stanzas.Still, Facebook faces challenges. The social media mammoth is reportedly blocking ad blockers on its desktop site. Ad blockers can hurt ad revenue for digital publishers such as Facebook.Facebook also says it is cracking down on click-bait headlines, IBD's Bill Peters reported. Facebook stock slipped on the news. But by banishing click bait, the social media conglomerate aims to improve its users' experience, which should boost advertising in the long run.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Elaine Low reports that Facebook has nearly doubled its daily active user base over the last four years, hitting an average of 1.13 billion DAUs in June 2016 vs. 552 million in June 2012. Mobile monthly active users have nearly tripled.TJX Cos. (TJX) is up 10% so far this year. Trading around 78, it's sunk back into a basing area after issuing a disappointing outlook for Q3 earnings results.The company -- which is the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods -- is the largest off-price apparel and home goods retailer in the U.S. On Tuesday, shares slid as the company forecast third-quarter profit will be below the expectations of industry analysts. The company blamed wage increases and a strong dollar, which hurt revenue from outside the U.S.TJX raised its profit forecast for the year ending January 2017, but that was also short of expectations.Shares of United Rentals (URI) are up 7% this year. EPS grew 0%, 4% and 6% in the past respective three quarters. Sales were down in two of those frames and flat in the third.The stock has a strong 88 Composite Rating.Shares gapped up 9% on July 21 when the company reported Q2 results. The $2.06 EPS was 24 cents better than Wall Street expected. Revenue of $1.42 billion topped expectations of $1.40 billion.United Rentals stuck by its full-year revenue forecast of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion.

145,HAL,"The major indexes were mixed Monday on the first trading day of August, spearheaded by another impressive gain by the Nasdaq composite. But oil stocks fell en masse as West Texas Intermediate oil futures dropped more than 3% and threatened to sink below $40 a barrel.WTI crude, currently at $40.26, last traded below the 40 level on April 18. Yet the commodity is hanging on to a year-to-date gain of more than 8%.The Nasdaq composite, buoyed by strength in mega-cap tech stocks of virtually all stripes, rallied more than 0.5%. The Nasdaq climbed as high as 5199.13 before pulling back a tad. The last time the tech-rich gauge traded above 5200 was on July 15, last year. The Nasdaq is now less than 1% below an all-time high of 5231.94 set on July 20, 2015.The Nasdaq 100 gained 0.6%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials each edged slightly into negative territory.Oil-related industry groups commanded the top eight slots to the downside among the 197 industry groups and subgroups tracked by IBD. They included drilling, royalty trust, international exploration and production (E&P), U.S. E&P and field services.Field services giant Halliburton (HAL) fell more than 3% to 42.04 in slightly below-average turnover. It sank further below the key 50-day moving average after piercing the line on July 21. The stock's weakness was spurred by a 14 cent net loss per share on a 35% slump in revenue for the second quarter. Halliburton is expected lose money in the third quarter as well.Integrated oil major Chevron (CVX), which posted a third quarterly net loss in a row on Friday, sank more than 2% to 100 in heavy trading. The stock is also pulling further below its rising 50-day line. Q2 revenue fell 27% to $29.3 billion, extending the company's revenue slump to eight straight quarters.On the upside in the stock market today, Biogen (BIIB) roared more than 5% higher to 304.69 in fast trading following positive phase-three results for a spinal muscular atrophy treatment developed jointly with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). The latter zoomed up 35% to 39.48 and faces a test of upside resistance at the 200-day moving average.Biogen, meanwhile, is poised to mark its highest close for 2016 so far, and the stock is now just 10% below a 52-week peak near 339.

"
148,HAL,"Amazon.com (AMZN) kicked off its Whole Foods takeover on Aug. 28 by slashing the prices of avocados, kale and other items at the ""Whole Paycheck"" grocery chain by as much as 43%. Who could argue with that?Consumer welfare has been the foremost concern of U.S. antitrust law since the 1980s, with price hikes seen as the surest sign of monopoly power. Yet a growing chorus of critics complain that Amazon and fellow internet giants Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are becoming too dominant, snuffing out competition, innovation and even freedom of expression.Wall Street is starting to ponder a trillion-dollar question: Could the Whole Foods buyout mark a turning point that leads to serious U.S. antitrust scrutiny for Amazon, Facebook and Google?""In the face of bona fide threats of regulatory and political opposition to Amazon, we against all odds finally may be facing 'Peak Amazon,' "" hedge fund manager Doug Kass wrote on July 11.His warning was premature. The Federal Trade Commission cleared the Whole Foods deal in barely two months.When it comes to total sales, Wal-Mart's (WMT) $486 billion towers over Amazon's $136 billion in 2016, and its nearly 4,700 U.S. stores dwarf Whole Foods' 460. However, Amazon did grab 43% of U.S. online sales in 2016, as well as 53% of the growth in the fast-moving sector, according to Slice Intelligence.Rather than unfair competition, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet's Google are the beneficiaries of the internet's winner-take-all dynamics, says Joachim Fels, managing director at Pimco. These superstars ""benefit from network effects that are especially strong in social media and software platforms, where the value of the services increases with the number of users,"" Fels wrote. ""Size begets size, which in turn begets size.""If someone wants to connect with friends or customers via social media, Facebook is the obvious choice: 85% of Americans who are online are members. Not even Google could compete with that. And if you want to shop, where else to start but Amazon.com, which lists hundreds of millions of items?But natural or not, their advantages unnerve observers from the far left to the White House and even at the pro-market University of Chicago, which spawned the big-isn't-necessarily-bad legal shift under President Reagan.Before Steve Bannon was pushed out of the White House as President Trump's senior advisor and returned to the populist, right-wing news site Breitbart, he reportedly made the case that Facebook and Google's dominance made them ""essential elements of 21st-century life (that) should be regulated as utilities."" Could that be sour grapes?  A majority of Americans now say they get their news from social media sites led by Facebook and from Google's search.XYet many conservatives and even some libertarians with traditionally hands-off inclinations toward business are growing concerned over the internet giants' power. That's intensified after Google's recent firing of an engineer for politically incorrect views on women and the high-tech workforce, and moves by Facebook and others to combat ""fake news"" and ban offensive speech.Trump raised the possibility of antitrust action against Amazon during the campaign. He still has CEO Jeff Bezos' empire in his sights, even if his real beef is with the Bezos-owned Washington Post. ""Amazon is doing great damage to taxpaying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!"" Trump tweeted recently.Worries about Amazon's impact on retail jobs and wages also risk making it a prime target on the left. Democratic Party leaders called for an antitrust crackdown as part of their ""Better Deal"" economic platform in July. Although they singled out the cable industry, rather than the Silicon Valley and Seattle tech giants, that could change. Rep. Keith Ellison, who represents Minneapolis and serves as deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, recently retweeted a Bloomberg opinion column titled ""Should America's Tech Giants Be Broken Up?"" with a one-word response: ""YES!""Economists and technologists worry that these internet companies' dominance will snuff out innovation. Consider Snap (SNAP), which raised $3.4 billion in March in the biggest IPO in three years. Already hopes have faded that it might erode Facebook's position. Analysts say Facebook has simply copied Snapchat's popular features and left it in the dust. With Snap shares lagging below its IPO price, funding may be harder to come by for the next David to challenge a Goliath.Luigi Zingales, finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, is calling for a more-proactive antitrust approach that would have kept Facebook from buying up Instagram and WhatsApp. He says the antitrust action against Microsoft (MSFT) in the 1990s and early 2000s helped create a climate in which Facebook and Google could rise to the top. But he worries that the current crop of leaders are growing too powerful to cut into their advantage. ""A system where this does not change is a system that is fossilized and hurts everyone,"" he said.Current antitrust policy focuses on preventing companies from consolidating power to raise prices, harming consumers. But Lina Khan, until recently a fellow at the New America Foundation's Open Markets program, argues that a new approach is needed to address companies like Amazon that operate online platforms.""The economics of platform markets create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded,"" Khan wrote in the Yale Law Review. ""Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational — even as existing doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible.""Khan may have a point: While shares of Amazon are off their recent all-time highs, they are still up 33% so far this year, even as earnings are expected to sink more than 20% in 2017.Amazon Prime may have started as a loss leader to gain customer loyalty, but Amazon has made the service so broad and attractive — offering free shipping, Amazon Prime Video, various special offers and now discounts at Whole Foods — that it is creating a world in which people make purchases only via the internet giant.Already about half of U.S. households are Amazon Prime members. And 55% of all online shopping searches started on Amazon last year vs. 30% in 2012. In recent months, Nike (NKE) and Sears (SHLD) threw in the towel and agreed to begin selling their athletic shoes and Kenmore appliances on Amazon.As for Google and Facebook, proving a price monopoly is a nonstarter since their services are free to consumers.But if not by pricing control, how should a monopoly be defined?Under the Democrats' ""Better Deal"" outline, regulators would use criteria to judge whether a merger would ""reduce wages, cut jobs, lower product quality, limit access to services, stifle innovation, or hinder the ability of small businesses and entrepreneurs to compete.""Those guidelines hearken back to ""the bad old days of antitrust, when it was used to protect inefficient small businesses and to pursue confused social goals,"" wrote Elizabeth Popp Berman, associate professor of sociology at the University at Albany in New York. ""While no one thinks that low prices for consumers are the only thing worth pursuing in life, they are the appropriate goal for antitrust because they make it coherent and administrable.""That consensus is entrenched in the antitrust enforcement agencies, codified into law through court decisions and resistant to change.Still, the EU's fine of Google for abusing its dominant position in internet search could hint at future U.S. policy.In prioritizing its own comparison-shopping site in search results, the European Commission said Google ""denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate.""Online platforms, Khan noted, ""control the essential infrastructure on which their rivals depend.""In a reflection of the increasingly fragile embrace of Democrats and Big Tech, the Google-funded, left-of-center New America think tank last month cut loose the Open Markets group after it praised the European Union's fine vs. Google.While Google disputes the EU's charge, noting Amazon's lead position in shopping searches, it agreed to make changes by Sept. 28. The EU also is scrutinizing Google's bundling of its Google Play app store with its free Android app.Luther Lowe, vice president of policy at Yelp (YELP), a crowdsourced review site, called the Google fine ""the most significant enforcement event in consumer tech antitrust in nearly 20 years,"" alluding to the Microsoft case.Yet the Microsoft antitrust fight was expensive and dragged on for years, underscoring the limitations of traditional antitrust actions in a complex and fast-moving industry.Tech journalist Walt Mossberg and economist Hal Singer have promoted addressing monopolistic and discriminatory competitive practices through a ""special, permanent, nonpartisan, independent commission — or even a special, narrowly focused court — to adjudicate disputes about internet issues."" The issues could run from network neutrality violations to heavy-handed behavior by Google or Amazon.Singer notes that such a tribunal already exists to handle complaints that cable companies are giving preference to their own programming.While Google is in the EU's line of fire now, Amazon is starting to come under the microscope.Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and co-author of the report, ""Amazon's Stranglehold,"" argued at a recent Forbes forum that Amazon's anticompetitive effect stems from its inherent conflict as both a direct seller and the operator of a platform that it invites other sellers to use.Khan cites Amazon's big discounts from Federal Express (FDX) and UPS (UPS) as a high-volume customer. Amazon passes along those discounts to independent companies that use its fulfillment services.Extending its empire to 460 Whole Foods stores substantially increases Amazon's logistics footprint, facilitating in-store pickup by customers and lowering the cost of last-mile delivery. Amazon already has been taking steps to increase its own delivery capability, in part with its Uber-like delivery force of flextime workers paid $19 to $24 per hour.While customers cheer the convenience and low cost, critics argue that companies may have no choice but to use Amazon's fulfillment services if they want to get competitive shipping rates and favorable listings.""What Amazon has done is turn an open market into a privately controlled arena where it sets the terms by which other players may buy and sell,"" Mitchell said at a Forbes forum. ""That's why its platform has to be broken off from its direct retail and made to comply with common carrier rules.""Yet the idea comes across as so radical, showing how poorly antitrust law is suited to dealing with today's tech titans.""You want Amazon to look like the local power company?"" countered Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law and Economics.

149,HAL,"First-time entrepreneurs often pour a lot of time and energy — not to mention money — into getting their ideas off the ground. By the time those who survived the initial stages of launching a business face the next hurdle of raising more money, many hope they can hit the jackpot with an angel investor and be off to the races. But that's not how it usually goes, says Patrick Henry, a San Diego-based business consultant and author of ""Plan Commit Win: 90 Days To Creating A Fundable Startup."" Securing funds for a startup is seldom quick and easy.""Raising money is a process, not an event,"" Henry told IBD.Here are steps that could help you find long-term funding for your startup.Refine your idea. Move beyond the back-of-the-envelope jottings and get lots of market feedback. Retool your idea based on what you hear. You have to provide a product with a price — that people are willing to pay — that exceeds what it costs to make, Henry writes.""You have to be solving an important problem for your customer,"" he said. ""And it has to be something that someone else can't come in and duplicate easily.""Create a roadmap. A business plan is more than a one-page guide to running your business. It's a detailed, month-by-month plan by which you can track key milestones and accomplishments, Henry says.""Know your market, the competitive landscape and your business model — how you make money,"" Henry said. ""From that, you develop an annual plan.""Your business plan is, in effect, a marketing document that will eventually help you raise capital. The key: Your business plan must articulate your progress and future plans.""Investors will ask you: What are you going to accomplish over the next three months?"" Henry said.You must be ready to show them where you've been and how you will get to where you want to be.Build a great team. Ideally, you want people who work well together and share goals and values, Henry says. Investors shy away from companies mired in chaos.And team-building goes both ways, Henry says. You want to attract the right kind of investors. When tech experts launch startups, the focus is often on finding investors who have expertise in other aspects of running a business.""Take a long-term vision of what kind of company you're building,"" Henry said. ""You're most likely giving up board seats to these investors. Are you going to be able to work with them? Will they be open to bringing other expert people to the board?""Get ready to launch. Equity investors look for an investor pitch deck, a 5- to 30-slide PowerPoint presentation.""It is a marketing tool, though it has to have good content, too,"" said Hal Shelton, a mentor at Score, a nonprofit association that helps small businesses get off the ground.Shelton, an active angel investor and author of ""The Secrets to Writing a Successful Business Plan,"" recommends to all of his clients a guide that's on Linked In's SlideShare called ""The 'Best' Startup Investor Pitch Deck & How to Present to Angels & Venture Capitalists.""Be precise with outreach. ""Angel investors tend to invest in what they know, so for example if you have a biotech product, don't go to an angel group that focuses on clean energy,"" Shelton said. ""Do your research or you won't hear back from them.""Shelton suggests looking at the Halo Report at the Angel Capital Association (angelcapitalassociation.org) to find out what angel investors are pouring their money into, by geographical area and industry.Finally, angel investors only make money when they exit an investment. So you must show them that you are willing to sell your business at the right time and for the right price, Shelton says. He suggests reading ""Early Exits"" by Basil Peters to build your knowledge on what angel investors look for.MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:5 Lessons That Disrupters Like Facebook Teach About Succeeding Now6 Critical Steps To Picking The Right Business Partner6 Ways To Inspire Employees' LoyaltyBootstrappers Learn To Build Teams; From Solo To Pro

U.S. crude production dipped to 9.34 million barrels per day.Analysts were expecting a 2.6 million-barrel decrease. Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported a 10.2 million-barrel decline in crude inventories last week.  the prior week, U.S. oil stockpiles dropped sharply but production rose to the highest level since late July 2015.Crude futures extended gains following the EIA data. U.S. crude rose 1.8% to close at $48.75 a barrel, the highest in about eight weeks.While prices have rallied in the last week, their persistent weakness this year has prompted shale companies to slow down their activity. The number of oil rigs fell last week, oilfield services giants Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL) see more cooling, and on Monday, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) said it would cut its 2017 capital spending outlook by $300 million, becoming the first U.S. producer to do so.""The current market conditions require lower capital intensity given the volatility of margins realized in this operating environment,"" CEO Al Walker said in a statementExxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.1% to 80.37 on the stock market today. Chevron (CVX) was up 0.7%. BP (BP) dipped 0.2% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) gained 0.3%.Oil prices got a boost Monday at a meeting of the joint OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee in St. Petersburg, Russia, as Nigeria agreed to cap production once it hits a sustainable 1.8 million barrels per day.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih also said the kingdom would cap crude exports at 6.6 million barrels per day next month, down from just under 7 million early last month and 1 million less than a year ago.RELATED:How OPEC's Failure To Lift Prices May Be A Success In Another Way

Chevron shares dropped 2.5%, ending at 103.07. BP (BP) shares were down 2.7% to 34.90.

Chevron, Shell, Exxon and other oil majors will report Q2 results this week. In a note out late Sunday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Longson said the gasoline market is ""severely oversupplied.""Crude oil demand is trending below refined product demand for the first time in three years. ""Refineries are the true consumer of crude oil, and crude oil demand is ultimately more important than aggregate refined product demand for oil balances,"" the note said. ""Given the oversupply in the refined product markets, fading refinery margins and economic run cuts, we expect crude oil demand to deteriorate further over the coming months.""Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, said the mood on the oil market was negative on higher rig counts and the Federal Reserve meeting this week, which could affect interest rates and the strength of the dollar.Rig counts hit a bottom during the second quarter and are now on the uptick, rising last week by 15 to 462, according to Baker Hughes (BHI). That marks the fourth straight rise and the seventh gain out of the last eight weeks.Oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) said in their earnings reports last week that they both believe the North American market has turned a corner.On Friday, Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said global markets are headed for a significant supply deficit, assuming steady growth in energy demand. He also said that the level of oil and gas exploration activity is at unprecedented lows, so there are ""huge growth runways"" for the oilfield service provider.Halliburton shares tumbled 2.9% to 42.54.

154,HAL,"Samsung, Hitachi and Tokyo Electron will likely mount a regulatory attack on Lam Research's (LRCX) $10.6 billion bid to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), but that's only if U.S. regulators don't kill the deal that would unite two of the largest makers of chip-manufacturing equipment, analysts said Thursday.KLA stock fell 2.8% to 67.51 in the the stock market today after toppling 10% on Wednesday when Lam said that regulatory hurdles in South Korea, China and/or Japan might extend the merger's close beyond the Oct. 20 deadline.Lam stock fell 4.5% Wednesday, and closed down 0.25% to 88.89. Shares are 6% extended from an 83.93 entry point achieved June 2. KLA stock, on the other hand, is down more than 8%, in a sell zone, from a 73.69 buy point hit June 20.The Lam-KLA merger has been riddled with antitrust concerns since its announcement last October. This is the third time the deal has been delayed, Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote in a research report Thursday.Shah downgraded Lam stock to neutral from buy and cut his price target to 85 from 95.IBD'S TAKE: Lam stock has a high IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it performs in the top 10% of all stocks. KLA stock trails with a CR of 84.In May, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a ""second request"" asking for more information into Lam's plan to buy KLA, likely over antitrust issues.Combined, Lam-KLA would have a $25 billion market cap, trailing leaders ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) with $46.9 billion and $29 billion, respectively. The duo would have 21% market share and be No. 1 or No. 2 in three out of four major manufacturing process steps.""This announcement reinforces a growing trend of skepticism from the DOJ that merger remedies will be sufficient to prevent higher prices,"" Shah wrote. ""Recent examples include Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI), Sysco Foods (SYY)-US Foods (USFD) and Albertsons-Safeway.""Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire noted KLA could ask Lam for more money or terminate the deal. Unlike Applied Materials abandoning its bid on Tokyo Electron in the face of antitrust concerns, Lam can't easily walk away from KLA.And foreign regulators are just as apt as U.S. regulators to question the antitrust angle, Maire wrote in a research note.""We are sure that Samsung is pushing Korean regulators for two pounds of flesh,"" he wrote. ""And Japanese regulators are probably well aware of the 'fox guarding the hen house' problem from both Tokyo Electron and Hitachi.""

159,HAL,"Schlumberger (SLB) will report second-quarter results Friday amid another retreat in oil prices and signs that even the U.S. energy sector may be faltering.XAnalysts expect the oilfield services provider's earnings to climb 23% to 30 cents per share with revenue up 1.2% to $7.25 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Management's guidance may turn dimmer. In early April, U.S. crude topped $54 a barrel. But since then, it has plunged below $43 a barrel and is now hovering around $46. Schlumberger stock has fallen more than 10% since early April and closed essentially flat at 66.83 on the stock market today.Continental Resources (CLR) CEO Harold Hamm recently warned $50 oil isn't sustainable and that a drop below $40 would idle rigs. Last month, Baker Hughes reported the first drop in U.S. rig counts since January, and U.S. drillers only added two rigs last week.U.S. production has stumbled as well. Energy Department data show declines in three out of the past 10 weeks after earlier being on pace to set a new record sometime this summer.The latest hiccups could cloud Schlumberger's plans. When the company reported Q1 results in April, North America was a bright spot, and management said that it would deploy more equipment here in Q2 as oil majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) shift their focus from overseas to shale operations.Also last quarter, Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard warned investors that the company expects another challenging year for its international segment as he sees a third year of underinvestment outside the Middle East, Russia and land operations in North America.Last week the International Energy Agency echoed that sentiment, saying underinvestment in new conventional projects will lead to a supply squeeze soon as investment in conventional oilfields hit the lowest level in over 70 years.But there are still some Middle East deals in the works. During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May, Schlumberger said it signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco to help build jobs in the oil and gas services sectors.The announcement was light on details so look for analysts to ask for more information on the conference call with management.Schlumberger could also give an update on raising prices for its services after offering deep discounts during the depth of the oil bust. But oil is struggling to hit the key $50 barrel as OPEC's production cut deal has done little to prop up prices.OPEC compliance fell to 78%, the lowest rate this year, after reaching a peak of more than 90% earlier this year, as production increased in Saudi Arabia, according to a report last week from the IEA.OPEC and top nonmembers will meet in Russia on July 24 to discuss the effectiveness of the deal and if deeper cuts are needed.Halliburton (HAL) will report Q2 results on July 24 and Baker Hughes, which merged with General Electric's (GE) oil & gas unit to form Baker Hughes, a GE Co.

We seek to deliver solid performance through the full cycle by owning a diversified portfolio of growth companies which we divide into three categories of growth stocks or buckets: stable, cyclical and select.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe select bucket of growth stocks -- which has about 35% of our assets -- are elite growers with disruptive technologies or business models. These are growing earnings at a double-digit rate. We base our growth projections on the size of the addressable market. Facebook (FB), for instance, will only invest in new opportunities that represent 1 billion or more potential users. These companies often look expensive because many of them, like Amazon (AMZN) with aggressive capital spending on its web services business, invest heavily to support future growth. This focus on long-term value creation tends to make them volatile.The stable bucket has about 50% to 65% of our assets. These are stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Microsoft (MSFT). They are industry-leading companies that are growing earnings slightly above average on a very consistent basis. It's this long-term compounding of earnings and cash flows which gives these companies so many options to create shareholder value such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or dividend payments.Comcast (CMCSA), for example, recently announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (DWA). Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) last year purchased SABMiller. Disney (DIS) has the cash to expand its theme parks globally with the opening of a park in Shanghai.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceOur cyclical-stocks bucket has companies whose revenue or profits are depressed for reasons that we think are fixable. Cyclical growers maintain the growth characteristics that we look for, but have issues with a visible inflection point. As patient, long-term investors, we can take advantage of price dislocations caused by near-term headwinds to establish new positions or dollar cost average into existing positions at attractive valuations.Schlumberger (SLB) and Grainger (GWW) are two. American Express (AXP) has faced revenue pressure on the top end by (JPMorgan) Chase (JPM) and Visa (V), and on the bottom by Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).IBD: And why do you prefer to be concentrated?Bourbeau: We usually have 40 to 50 names. We're around 47 now. We have 15% annual turnover, so we hold for eight to 10 years on average.We're concentrated because we're looking for the No. 1 leader in a market. Those companies have the highest margins, best free cash flow. They take over weaker companies. They become bigger and more powerful, harder to compete with. They have visionary men and women. Great companies remain great for a long time. Who needs the No. 2 or 3 company?IBD: Give me an example, please, as of your latest disclosure.Bourbeau: Sure. Schlumberger's rivals include Halliburton (HAL) (in oilfield services) and Baker Hughes (BHI) (in oil & gas machinery). But Schlumberger is three times bigger than Halliburton (in terms of market capitalization), its nearest rival in oil field services. (And more than five times the size of Baker Hughes.) It is by far the leader in products, distribution, margins. It is the favorite partner of exploration and production companies and integrated multinationals.IBD: What's your Facebook thesis?Bourbeau: Its rare business model takes advantage of the move of advertising from old media to new and to mobile from the desktop.They bought WhatsApp, they've got Messenger, they've got Instagram. And look at what they've done with video. They're building apps for billions of users as opposed to some of their smaller competitors.If you're an advertiser, you're getting targeting that you never had before. It can be refined down to age, demographic, gender, likes and dislikes. Your ads' effectiveness goes higher. And Facebook is just beginning this movement.IBD: Is Amazon the same -- one innovation building on another?Bourbeau: You're frustrated as investors, seeing huge ramp-ups in capital expenditures. But you know they're also seeing opportunities that we mere mortals could never see. Amazon Web Services started as a pet project for their retail operation. They built an infrastructure that they used maybe one month a year, then they wondered how to use it the rest of the year, and it grew 50%, 60%, 70%. They created an industry, renting software vs. buying it, which (Amazon founder and CEO) Jeff Bezos says will be bigger than retail.What's next? We don't know. Logistics? Moving packages around the world? Not all of their innovations will work. And we're aware of stretched valuations. But an innovative company with $10 billion in free cash flow gives us no reason to be alarmed.IBD: You boosted your stake in VMware (VMW) not long ago. Why?Bourbeau: This is another innovative company that created an entire business, which is server virtualization. Now, that's the mature part of their business. They still have a massive lead, but that will erode over time.They have another suite of products. And creating an easy user experience to a hybrid cloud is something they're going to have a leadership position in. They made acquisitions in network virtualization. One was Nicira (in 2012). They've got deployment to paying customers. The value proposition vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is early, but if it works it will be a massive home run.To be balanced, the Dell acquisition (of EMC (EMC), which owns a stake in VMware) was unfortunate. Structuring the deal with tracking stock (that mimicked shares of VMware) punished equity in VMware and made a messy transition. But we're finally toward the tail end of that. VMware will operate as a public company.It has double-digit free cash flow yield. It is a very cheap asset. They've got a huge buyback in place. It is a name we continue to like.IBD: Another position you've boosted is Xilinx (XLNX). Why?Bourbeau: This is an interesting company. They don't own their own manufacturing. They design intricate, high-power chips for very particular applications like cell towers, moving massive data, programmable logic device (PLD) chips that can handle enormous amounts of instructions and can change instructions on a chip remotely.They're used in defense. There are 17 PLD chips in the Mercedes S-class cars. And the fact that they don't manufacture them means this is almost a software company in terms of margins. Lastly, this was a duopoly. But Intel (INTC) bought Altera, so Xilinx could be an acquisition target down the road, not that's that what we're playing for.IBD: Cyclicals that you like or added to recently -- American Express, Schlumberger, VMWare, Xilinx: only VMWare has average growth of 10% or faster in the last three and five years. Only Schlumberger has expected earnings north of 10% in 2017. Do these companies need faster growth to get their stocks moving? When will that happen?Bourbeau: Growth rates are not the main criteria with cyclical stocks. We target an inflection point for each. If reached, it should cause earnings to normalize and stock valuation to increase.Here are their inflection points. For SLB, they include crude oil prices reaching supply-demand equilibrium and global production ramping up. Also, 65% incremental margins, which is a lot higher than any other recovery. For AXP: normalization of business post Costco (which no longer accepts AmEx cards). Normal earnings growth rate should return in 2017. XLNX: product cycle and further application penetration as well as market share gains. VMW: we don't have a comment.IBD: How do you and Margaret Vitrano divide duties, running this fund?Bourbeau: We don't divide up the portfolio. We're devoted to the same process. But we each have a slight bias in our knowledge bases. Margaret, given her consumer discretionary and technology background, has different experiences from my health care and financials background. But when we look at companies, we're on the same calls at the same time. Our different backgrounds helps us fact-check each other.IBD: And who was your mentor, Peter?Bourbeau: The first was Richie Freeman, who has run ClearBridge Aggressive Growth (SHRAX) (since 1983, and whose co-manager now is Evan Bauman). We talk every day. He's just down the hall. We're constantly talking ideas, sports.But our portfolio construction is now a little different. Richie's turnover is zero. When he's comfortable with a name, he's on it forever. Margaret and I are more disciplined in valuation. Our turnover is 15%, which makes Richie's fund look like a hedge fund.If you look at sectors, Richie and Evan are eclectic. Richie is more likely to have zero in a given sector if he doesn't like it. That's not how Margaret and I look at the world. We have industrials, media (and something in every sector). And Richie can have significant overweights. And he is more all-market-capitalizations. Margaret and I are more large cap.

Shares tumbled to their lowest level since May despite raised full-year EPS and revenue guidance. DuPont (DD) also beat on the top and bottom lines. Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks. Fortinet shares tumbled.TAL Education (TAL) topped earnings and sales estimates, as per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $321.9 million came out ahead of forecasts for 28 cents and $307.8 million. For the current quarter, the China-based education company sees revenue of $428.4 million to $433.8 million, above views for $424.8 million, per Yahoo Finance estimates. Meanwhile, peer New Oriental Education (EDU) also pulled ahead of forecasts with 41 cents EPS and $486.4 million, in addition to a 36.9% bump in total student enrollments; the midpoint of Q1 revenue guidance pulled just ahead of current views. TAL and New Oriental shares rose 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively,  but the latter's breakout failed Thursday.Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue. Shares reversed modestly lower from a record high but remained in buy range.Baidu (BIDU) earnings rose 143%, well over views, while revenue climbed 14% to an in-line $3.08 billion.

166,HAL,"While much has been written about information technology companies investing in artificial intelligence, Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton notes that many non-tech companies are capitalizing on AI technology as well.Clinton has put together a portfolio of 17 publicly traded non-tech companies that are making investments in AI to improve their businesses. In a recent blog post, Clinton notes that he assembled the portfolio as a ""fun exercise"" and a way to draw attention to the sweeping nature of AI advancements.

167,HAL,"Eight years ago, it took Continental Resources (CLR) and its service companies over a month to drill to the bottom of a well in the Bakken shale play. A year ago, it took 18-20 days, and it looked like that was the technical limit on how fast a well could be drilled.Wrong.Wells can now be drilled in 13-15 days thanks to improved sensors that keep drillers in the optimal drilling zone, more effective drill bits that can power though the Bakken's hard rock, and other advances.The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S., despite recent increases, could stay depressed for years. But don't let that fool you. New technology and techniques are unlocking more oil per well. While OPEC has succeeded in forcing U.S. producers to cut back, the industry that is emerging from the oil bust has found ways to pump oil faster and more cheaply, making it a tougher adversary for the next global standoff.""The downturn in oil prices has accelerated the adoption rate of new technology because at this point the industry's back is against the wall and you have to adapt or you're going to die,"" said Matt Marietta, an analyst at Stephens.Technological innovation will be key as oil prices head up again. By slashing costs, producers were able to continue pumping when oil prices first collapsed, but that was largely the result of squeezing discounts from suppliers.In fact, only 20% of current cost reductions have come from technology improvements, according to Dan Guffey, vice president of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus. The other 80% came from service providers slashing costs and working with negative margins. But rock-bottom prices won't last forever, he warned.While BP (BP), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and other oil majors with deep financial resources can take their time adopting new techniques, smaller producers have been forced to adapt quickly.Continental, which was among the pioneers in the original fracking revolution, is seeing success with enhanced well-completion techniques that it started doing two years ago when oil prices were higher.For example, the company now uses 15 million-20 million pounds of sand in each proppant load, which contain particles that hold hydraulic fractures open, up from 2.5 million-3 million pounds two to three years ago, said Warren Henry, vice president of investor relations and research at Continental, noting that the cost of sand has been falling.""In effect you're hitting (the well) with a really big hammer,"" he said.The result has been to keep oil flowing from some wells, even as prices neared recession-era lows. In its Q1 earnings report, Continental said enhanced completions in the Scoop shale play in Oklahoma have increased initial production rates 30%-35% vs. traditional completions.""I am proud of our teams as they continue to increase production and improve well economics through our ongoing process for optimizing completion designs,"" said Gary Gould, Continental's vice president of production and resource development, in an earnings release.""We continue to apply enhanced completion designs on all new operated wells, by testing, for example, various proppant volumes, stage lengths and proppant sizes in order to determine the optimum completion design for each area in each play.""Other companies are working on new twists on older practices. EOG Resources (EOG) announced last month that it has been injecting natural gas into existing wells in the Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas.EOG wouldn't provide further details on how exactly its new method works. But James Williams, an economist at WTRG, said the process is likely similar to a water or CO2 flood, where liquid or gas is pumped in a well, mixes with oil to add pressure, and pushes oil toward wells at the other end of a field to be pumped out.EOG has been working on the process for three years and plans to do another pilot project later this year to test 32 wells.The company cautioned that the new method might not work in other shale plays with different geologic properties.Halliburton (HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Flotek Industries (FTK) are working on customized nanofluids designed to reduce surface tension and increase a well's productivity.Nanofluids are made up of molecules that are smaller than those found in traditional fluids and reduce the friction to increase the flow rates of oil and natural gas out of the reservoir rock, Marietta said.Another technique that has gained popularity in U.S. plays is pad drilling, or drilling several wells from a single location to reduce the time and money spent disassembling the rig and moving it to another spot. Improving drilling time is a priority for shale drillers, as each additional drilling day can cost thousands of dollars.Meanwhile, the rigs themselves have also become more advanced. Helmerich & Payne (HP) pioneered the alternating current (AC) rig for shale back in the early 2000s. The rig's ability to drill at various speeds improves precision and energy efficiency vs. direct current (DC) rigs.Newer versions of the AC rig reduce ""spud to spud time"" -- or the time it takes between starting a new well to moving to another well -- to 7-10 days from 3-4 weeks, according to Marietta. That While good for oil producers, that also means suppliers of drilling products and services will see lower spending revenue and employment because fewer rigs are needed.More expensive offshore drilling is also seeing new advances that could be ready when prices get high enough to begin new projects.General Electric's (GE) oil and gas unit used carbon fiber technology to create a light-flexible pipe that connects a floating platform to the sea floor in deepwater drilling, like in the Gulf of Mexico or off Brazil.Ray Burke, a global product leader for GE Oil & Gas in the U.K., said the new pipe has been in the works for three years and will go into service in mid-2018.Burke wouldn't disclose the companies that are looking at the pipe but said several international and national oil companies are interested. He said the pipe can produce cost savings of 20%.""The simple story is we are going deeper and using carbon fibers and the end results are going to be cheaper for our clients.""Advances in drilling will help continue the success that U.S. companies have seen over the last five years, said Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.New technology can also lead to more gradual moves in the price of oil, instead of wild swings, as shale is more nimble than conventional production, he added.OPEC countries like Nigeria and Venezuela that haven't invested in newer technology will be hurt by advances in the U.S., said Thomas O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat. Russia also can't exploit shale and Arctic assets because of economic sanctions that limit Westerners from helping develop the new fields.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has low-cost production fields, and state-run oil company Saudi Aramco can bring in foreign experts knowledgeable about fracking and new technologies, he added.Still, OPEC must now grapple with U.S. shale producers on the rebound, which could lead to volatility, O'Donnell said. ""The oil order has changed. It's conventional oil on one side, and new shale oil on the other.""To be sure, new technologies and techniques don't all deliver immediate, upfront savings, and finding the right technique for each reservoir can be time-consuming and expensive.The oil business remains capital intensive, and capital has been in short supply for some companies. Breitburn Energy Partners, SandRidge Energy, Magnum Hunter Resources, Energy XXI, Goodrich Petroleum and others haven't been able to survive lower oil prices and filed for bankruptcy protection.But for those with strong balance sheets, the new techniques can, over decades, boost the estimated total recovery for a well, as more oil is recovered for longer.""We are leaving behind 80% of oil in place, even with the best technology we have today,"" Continental's Henry said. ""So we'll continue to be surprised at the improvements that can be made.""

171,HAL,"The second quarter was rough for oilfield service providers Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB), but the companies could give positive guidance for Q3.While the U.S. oil-rig count fell 25% from April through June, it climbed by seven last week to 447, marking the third straight rise and the sixth gain out of the last seven weeks. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Robin Shoemaker said the rig count is up 10% from its bottom and will be up 10%-15% in Q3.When the Halliburton announces results Wednesday, analysts see the company swinging to an 18-cent per-share loss from a profit of 44 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is expected to decline 36.4% to $3.76 billion.Halliburton should give an update on its $1 billion cost-savings plan it initiated after the merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) was abandoned over regulatory concerns.Schlumberger, which announces results Thursday, is expected to report a 75% drop in EPS to 22 cents and a 21% decline in revenue to $7.12 billion.Baker Hughes reports July 28.IBD's TAKE: Shares of Halliburton and Schlumberger are nearing buy points as oil prices have rallied and spurred renewed drilling activity and could join oil giants like Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell in buy territory.The industry has taken a hit as exploration and production companies slash investment. In May, analysts at Wood Mackenzie said the oil and gas industry will cut $1 trillion from exploration and development spending in the next several years. The deepest cuts are in the U.S., the report said, with capital spending down 50% this year.""Customers are spending less on drilling and that translates immediately into lower revenue for Halliburton and Schlumberger,"" KeyBanc's Shoemaker said.He also expects ""margin deterioration"" from Q1 to Q2 and that weakness out of Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela will weigh more than expected on results.""The only bright spot currently is that activity levels and oil prices are rising,"" Shoemaker said. ""So in the third quarter it's definitely possible that Halliburton and Schlumberger have increases in revenues in North America.""

172,HAL,"The stock market padded Tuesday's strong gains with a healthy advance by midday Wednesday. Large caps moved ahead of small caps.Meanwhile, Atlanta-based regional banking leader SunTrust Banks (STI) continued to act well after breaking out of a nearly six-month cup-with-handle pattern with a 43.13 buy point. The stock gained 2% to 44.01, up 2% past the proper entry.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose 0.8% to 0.9% each after advancing 2% and 1.4%, respectively, on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average was also up 0.9%. Utilities continued to sink after having a white-hot first quarter. The Dow Jones utility average fell 0.7%. The small-cap S&P 600 added 0.6%. Volume was tracking lower on the Nasdaq from the previous session, but it was higher on the NYSE.The super regional bank and money center bank industry subgroups held a spot among the top 15 advancers among IBD's 197 industry groups in the stock market today, each rising more than 2% so far. The growing prospect of another rate hike at either the June or July Federal Reserve meetings has apparently attracted more institutional buying in lenders. Higher short-term interest rates will enable banks to charge more for loans, improving profit margins.SunTrust suffered mightily in the wake of the subprime debt crash, as the bank suffered net losses in both 2009 and 2010, but earnings have since gotten back on track. Wall Street sees EPS rising in the low- to mid-single digits both this year and next. Pretax margin has risen sharply over the past five years, from 0.2% in 2010 to 31.5% last year. It has total assets of $194 billion as of March this year. Non-performing loans represented just 0.7% of total loans outstanding. A quarter-to-quarter increase of $303 million in such loans was due mainly to Wall Street downgrades of energy-related debt.SunTrust gets an 82 Earnings Per Share Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Just two other companies in its Banks-Super Regional subgroup get a higher EPS Rating: Great Western Bancorp (GWB) (92) and Regions Financial (RF) of Birmingham, Ala. (86).The 5% buy zone in SunTrust extends up to 45.29.Which commercial and real estate-focused bank joined IBD Leaderboard as a premium growth play that just also broke out?

The field services is ranked highest among the three at 100th among 197 IBD groups and subgroups, as seen in IBD's daily rankings. In the group, 800-pound industry gorilla Halliburton (HAL) (EPS 8, Relative Strength Rating 84) gained more than 2.5% in light trade to 42.53 and was looking to clear a 42.92 handle buy point in a very deep, cup-style bottoming base.Oil States (OIS), Superior Energy Services (SPN), Archrock Partners (APLP), RPC Inc.

179,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) is interested in smaller acquisitions in the future to help boost product offerings, after terminating its $28 billion deal to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) amid antitrust pressure.A successful buyout of Baker Hughes would have helped the oilfield services company with its artificial lift and chemical lines, Halliburton said Tuesday. Now it must look elsewhere.“We are going to invest in those product lines where we are weak and look at collective acquisitions to round them out,” management said on a conference call.Shares closed down 4.7% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes fell 3.8%, and rival Schlumberger (SLB) lost 2.9%, as oil prices slumped.U.S. oil had jumped 20% during April, with Brent futures gaining 21%, but they have since retreated amid signs that OPEC is continuing to boost output and fresh indications of a slowing Chinese economy.Halliburton doesn’t think the earlier rally in oil prices will lead to meaningful activity increases in the second half of the year.“Clearly they (producers) are more optimistic about things, but I don’t think we’ve seen that optimism translated into any set plans to actively increase rigs in the back half of the year,” management said.Earlier Tuesday, Halliburton reported first-quarter earnings excluding items fell 85.7% to 7 cents per share, beating analyst views by 4 cents. Revenue fell 40% to $4.2 billion.But including more than $2 billion in charges for asset impairments, severance costs and other effects of the oil slump, Halliburton's net loss widened to $2.41 billion from $643 million. Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger alone already have cut tens of thousands of jobs since late 2014.Halliburton also booked costs of $378 million related to the Baker Hughes bid. Halliburton must pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes after calling off the megamerger Sunday. The agreement was first announced in November 2014, but had been extended several times to try to meet regulator concerns.

The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year.

Salesforce stock jumped 6.1% for the week, breaking out of a base and nearly hitting an all-time high.Cisco Systems reported a 6% adjusted EPS gain for its fiscal Q3, with revenue up 3%, both edging past analyst forecasts. Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts.

But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain. For Q2, Wal-Mart sees EPS of 95 cents to $1.08, with the midpoint above estimates for 98 cents.Shares popped 7.6% for the week, retaking their 200-day and 50-day lines after gapping down in sympathy with Target on Wednesday.Outshining its ailing department store peers, TJX (TJX) Q1 EPS and sales rose 10% to 76 cents and $7.54 billion, comfortably topping. Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus. Ross Stores fell 3.4% for the week, while TJX climbed 3.7%.General Motors acquisition Cruise Automation confirmed that its self-driving technology was being tested on Chevy Bolts after photos of the all-electric cars surfaced online. Uber on Thursday also posted a photo of a hybrid Ford (F) Fusion outfitted with self-driving technology that it said would be undergoing testing.GM and Lyft plan to road-test autonomous Bolt taxis in the coming months, and Ford has established a subsidiary focused on autonomous-car technology and ride-sharing. But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance. But its Q2 profit margin shrank to 11.9% before interest and taxes, down from 14.4% in the prior quarter. Campbell said fiscal Q3 EPS rose 5% to 65 cents, beating by a penny. But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

Senator Christopher Dodd and former Rep.  Barney Frank, overhauled the financial system to make it more panic-proof. Is it? The answer may surprise.The Obama administration's position is clear: ""We can say without question that Wall Street reform has made our financial system safer and sounder,"" Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew recently said on the sixth anniversary of the law's signing. Up to a point, this is true. Banks are required to have more capital than before the 2008-09 financial crisis, and this creates a larger buffer against losses.Capital typically -- but not always -- consists of shareholders' investments in banks. In 2016, the ratio of the biggest bank-holding companies' common stock to risk-weighted assets (loans, securities) was 12.2%, more than double its level in early 2009, says the Federal Reserve.This means that banks can better survive severe economic shocks -- deep recessions or speculative excesses. Since 2009, the Fed regularly subjects major banks to a computer-driven ""stress test."" It simulates a deep slump and examines how banks would fare. In the latest stress test, unemployment was assumed to double to 10%, the stock market to lose half its value, and the economy's output to drop nearly 8%, larger than the decline in the Great Recession.Under these conditions, estimated bank losses were huge: $385 billion, says the Fed. Borrowers defaulted; bonds lost value. Still, sufficient capital remained that all 33 bank holding companies -- those with assets exceeding $50 billion, representing about four-fifths of the banking sector -- continued to meet regulatory capital requirements. The capital ratio dropped from 12.2% to 8.4%. But that was well above the 4.5% required minimum (for large banks, the minimum can be higher).This is good news. The essence of the 2008-09 financial crisis was a panic among large depositors (hedge funds, pension funds, corporations) -- a bank ""run."" They withdrew their money from banks, because they didn't know whether the banks were solvent. If banks' capital cushions had been larger, these fears might have been allayed and the withdrawals limited. In reality, the outflows threatened a second Great Depression, as banks cut lending and dumped bonds to meet depositor demands.What avoided another Depression was the quick response of the Federal Reserve, which -- acting in its role as ""lender of last resort"" -- supplied trillions of dollars of credit to banks and other financial institutions to offset the loss of private credit. Without these infusions, who knows what would have happened.Now, the bad news. In Dodd-Frank, Congress makes it much harder for the Fed to act as lender of last resort, says Hal Scott, a professor at Harvard Law School and a respected expert on financial regulation, in his book ""Connectedness and Contagion: Protecting the Financial System from Panics."" The consequences, argues Scott, could be catastrophic. A U.S. depression would ""pose challenges to our political system,"" as well as spreading abroad and undermining the U.S. global role.During the financial crisis, the Fed relied on section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. This provision gave the Fed wide discretion in making loans when ""unusual and exigent"" circumstances prevailed. Now, Dodd-Frank has imposed restrictions on 13(3). As Scott shows, these include: The secretary of the treasury must approve all nonbank loans; there can be no nonbank programs for a single borrower; collateral requirements are toughened; loans must be disclosed within a year. Some of these may be sensible alone; together, they create an obstacle course for crisis lending.Scott estimates that $7 trillion in funds are potentially vulnerable to panicky investor runs. Breaking up the big banks is no solution if, say, the investor run strikes money-market mutual funds.There is a real issue here. The Fed has enormous powers; democratically elected officials think they should exercise some control over those powers. But a financial crisis -- a panic -- is by its very nature a rapidly moving event that usually was unpredicted. (If anticipated, it could likely be defused.) Unless the crisis is dealt with decisively, it could become a monster that cannot be contained.The verdict on Dodd-Frank is mixed. One goal was to improve short-term financial stability. That has been achieved. The other goal was political: to handcuff those who engineered the financial ""bailout,"" which -- though necessary -- is immensely unpopular. That explains why Congress restricted the Fed. Ironically, legislation designed to protect us from financial panic may make some future panic more likely.

184,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) called off their megamerger Sunday in the face of antitrust objections from U.S. and European regulators.""Challenges in obtaining remaining regulatory approvals and general industry conditions that severely damaged deal economics led to the conclusion that termination is the best course of action,"" said Halliburton Chairman and CEO Dave Lesar in a joint statement with Baker Hughes.The Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal was initially valued at nearly $35 billion but was worth about $28 billion as of Friday due to plunging stock prices. Halliburton will pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee.The merger would have combined the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services firms, taking on current No. 1 Schlumberger (SLB). The agreement was first announced in November 2014, but had been extended several times to try to meet regulator concerns.""The companies' decision to abandon this transaction – which would have left many oilfield service markets in the hands of a duopoly – is a victory for the U.S. economy and for all Americans,” said Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement.On April 6, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to block the deal. The European Union also seemed likely to object.On April 22, Halliburton gave some preliminary first-quarter figures, delaying its official Q1 release to May 3 from April 25.The sharp drop in oil and natural gas prices has slashed demand for oil services firms. Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger have cut tens of thousands of jobs since late 2014.Over the past 12 months, Halliburton stock has fallen 14%, but Baker Hughes has tumbled 29%, as investors saw a deal as less and less likely. But since April 6, when the DOJ filed its lawsuit, shares of both companies have risen about 13%.

190,HAL,"The antitrust concerns that forced Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) to call off their merger may actually reduce competition instead of preserving it.The combination of the No. 2 and 3 oilfield service providers would've improved pricing power for the remaining companies. But regulators have now made that more difficult with one of the biggest players staying independent.""I think this is going to make it far more challenging for some small and midsize U.S. land and service companies to get pricing power back,"" said Matthew Marietta, an equity research analyst at Stephens.The failure of the Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal also could lead to more intense competition among the smaller players and increase bankruptcy rates, he added. ""In a weird way this could lead to fewer service companies in the long run.""But Robin Shoemaker, a director at KeyBanc, said the market is ""extremely oversupplied"" and that even if the merger did happen, competition would stay ""fierce"" because of overcapacity.Meanwhile, other suitors may not immediately call on Baker Hughes. General Electric (GE) was reportedly interested in Halliburton assets that needed to be offloaded to get antitrust approval for the Baker Hughes deal but, Marietta doesn't think GE would be in the market for Baker Hughes as a whole.But two good takeover targets for GE or another major player would be Oceaneering International (OII) and Flotek Industires (FTK), he said. Flotek is a specialty chemical company, and Oceaneering is a leader in a variety of subsea products.Baker Hughes shares spiked nearly 5% higher at the open, rising above the 200-day moving average. But shares reversed to close down 2% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 1.8%. Moody's said Monday that both companies are still on review for a possible credit downgrade.Rival Schlumberger (SLB) shares fell 1.2% as crude prices dipped. GE edged up 0.5%, Oceaneering lost 0.8%, and Flotek dipped 1%.For now, Baker Hughes is charting a course as an independent company. On Monday, it said it would buy back $1.5 billion in shares and debt of $1 billion using the $3.5 billion breakup fee that Halliburton must now pay on May 4. Baker Hughes is also refinancing its $2.5 billion credit facility.Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead said in a statement that the company would remain focused on well construction, including drilling services, drill bits and completions, and production services, including artificial-lift and production-chemicals innovation to help “customers lower their costs and maximize production.”Baker Hughes will cut $500 million in costs “that were retained in compliance with the former merger agreement.”Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger alone already have cut tens of thousands of jobs since late 2014. Shoemaker expects further cuts at Baker Hughes as it tries to lower costs and continue building-back market share that it lost waiting for the merger to go through.Halliburton will have its first-quarter conference call, which had been scheduled for last week, on Tuesday after pre-announcing a 40% drop in revenue to $4.2 billion.

Sunrun was down nearly 12%, even with Friday's 7.5% pop.Israeli giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) beat Q1 earnings and sales estimates, but it guided Q2 slightly below consensus. Teva said its $40 billion buyout of the Allergan (AGN) generics business is on track to close in June, despite some earlier delays. Teva stock rose 3 cents to 50.30 for the week.Allergan reported mixed Q1 results -- earnings beat and sales missed -- but the drugmaker said it'll buy $10 billion in stock. Allergan, fresh off a failed takeover by Pfizer (PFE), signaled it'll focus more on improving operations than on making big buyouts in the near future. Shares rose 10.8%.A third generics giant, Perrigo (PRGO), hit a four-year low after its Q1 report on Thursday, though since it issued guidance last month there were few surprises.

195,HAL,"Staples (SPLS) and Office Depot (ODP) terminated their merger plans after a D.C. federal judge late Tuesday granted an FTC injunction to block the deal, dismissing arguments that Amazon.com (AMZN) and others would provide sufficient competition.Staples stock fell 20% on the stock market today, while Office Depot plunged 37%.Judge Emmet Sullivan said that the FTC had shown a ""reasonable probability"" that the merger would ""substantially impair competition"" for office supply sales to large business customers.Staples and Office Depot had argued that Amazon, Costco (COST), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others would provide sufficient competition. The FTC, which hailed the ruling, said Amazon and other sellers of office supplies did not have sufficient heft with big corporations.""We are extremely disappointed that the FTC’s request for preliminary injunction was granted despite the fact that it failed to define the relevant market correctly, and fell woefully short of proving its case,"" Staples CEO Ron Sargent said in a statement.Staples will pay a $250 million break-up fee to Office Depot.The Obama administration has become more aggressive in blocking mergers on antitrust grounds. In the past year or so, it's blocked a Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger -- though it recently blessed a Charter Communications (CHTR)-TWC tie-up. It's also stopped the General Electric (GE) appliance unit sale to Electrolux and the Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI) oil services combination. 
"
196,HAL,"Federal regulators have been on a roll when it comes to blocking proposed megamergers.The Staples (SPLS)-Office Depot (ODP) deal is simply the latest casualty. The victims have come from all walks of corporate life, from oilfield services giants Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to cable television titans Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC).Several more big takeovers are threatened. Health insurance behemoths Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) are looking to recite corporate nuptials as are Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM), but already regulators are whispering their concerns. The  Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)-Rite Aid (RAD) deal also is in doubt.Is it politics, or happenstance? San Diego State University finance professor Nikhil Varaiya, an expert on M&A activity, cautions not to read too much into it even though there has been heightened scrutiny of mergers in the last year of the Obama administration. Varaiya agrees there's been more activity, but says it usually depends on the individual circumstances.""(It) could be because these companies are trying to merge in this time period,"" he said. ""Halliburton’s merger attempt, for example, reflected the lower demand for oil and their trying to reduce capacity. The concern by regulators might be that when the oil markets pick up, they might have a dominant company.""Halliburton and Baker Hughes called off their $28 billion merger on May 1, citing tough resistance from U.S. and European regulators. Still, Varaiya noted that future Justice Department actions on proposed mergers could hinge in part on who comes into power in the fall.""Any Democrat administration tends to be more concerned about concentration and competitiveness,"" Varaiya said. ""So it's likely they will bring more cases before a judge.""U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington late Tuesday agreed with Federal Trade Commission regulators that the pairing of Staples and Office Depot would violate antitrust laws and reduce competition.Shares of Staples gapped down 18% to 8.37 in the stock market Wednesday after the office supply giants announced they would no longer try to merge. Office Depot plunged 40% to 3.62.Roy Behren, partner and portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Funds in Valhalla, N.Y., said it would have been hard for Staples and Office Depot to satisfy the FTC.""In the case of Office Depot, which we have been monitoring carefully but declined to invest in because it involved creation of a monopoly, you essentially had the two main players in the market. That would create problematic market power,"" Behren said.But Behren doesn't rule out political influence in all cases.""We view that the Bush administration was much less inclined to prosecute what they perceived as antitrust or market concentration,"" he said. ""Obama administration regulators were aware in the case of Baker Hughes that Halliburton had agreed to divest $7 billion of revenue to get this done. That still didn’t get the job done.""Behren said the most scrutinized transaction at the moment is the Walgreens Boost Alliance deal to buy smaller drug store chain Rite Aid. Walgreens has agreed to divest stores to get the $17 billion deal done, but regulators are still scrutinizing it.""It’s possible that structural remedies could satisfy regulators,"" he said.Meanwhile, the list of failed mergers gets longer. General Electric's (GE) proposed sale of its appliance business to Sweden's Electrolux fell through in December after the Justice Department said the deal would unfairly reduce competition in that sector and asked a federal judge to block it. Last year's $3.5 billion bid by privately held US Foods for rival Sysco (SYY) was blocked on grounds that it would have created a food distribution behemoth.No. 1 cable company Comcast's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable was turned down in late August of last year after regulators threatened to issue a hearing designation that would have delayed its consideration for months or years.Instead, last Friday the FCC OK'd Charter Communications' (CHTR) offer for TWC, and Charter's separate purchase of Bright House Networks. The combined deals, valued at nearly $79 billion, will create the No. 2 cable TV and Internet provider, the FCC said.The DOJ also is eyeing health insurance consolidation.No. 3 U.S. insurer by revenue Aetna agreed to merge with Humana in a deal valued at $34 billion. But William Baer, assistant attorney general, said during a Senate subcommittee hearing last week that the proposed tie-up would be ""very, very carefully"" scrutinized.No. 2 insurer Anthem hammered out a deal with another major player, Cigna. But in a regulatory filing this month, Cigna said ""In light of the complexity of the regulatory process and dynamic environment, it is possible that such approvals may not be obtained in 2016.""Michael Shannon, another Westchester Capital managing partner and portfolio manager, said that with the national elections just months away some candidates are talking tough about regulating mergers.""In past elections, parties (running for office) would talk, saying we’re going to do this or do that. But regulators are under the law,"" Shannon said. ""At the end of the day, you can’t just rule as you want to.""

197,HAL,"U.S. oil rigs in operation fell 8 to 343 in the week ended April 22, the fewest since November 2009, Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday. It was the fifth straight weekly decline, even as oil prices continue to rebound.Shale companies have slashed drilling activity since late 2014, as crude prices plunging from above $100 a barrel in mid-2014 made many projects unprofitable. U.S. crude production held up remarkably well thanks to companies focusing on the most-productive fields, with the best crews and new technical tricks. But output has now dropped below 9 million barrels a day, though that's only the lowest since late 2014.Crude prices have rebounded in past three months. U.S. futures rose 1.3% to $43.73 a barrel on Friday, near 2016 highs. That was up more than 8% for the week even after major oil producers failed to agree on an output freeze at the April 17 Doha meeting.But oil prices haven't risen high enough, or long enough, to encourage exploration and production companies to step activity so far. Some new drilling might be marginally profitable at current prices, but there's no guarantee that oil will hold above $40 next week, let alone the end of 2016.Oil field services giant Schlumberger (SLB) fell fractionally on the stock market today after reporting a sharp earnings decline that was not as bad as feared late Thursday, though it warned of further industry deterioration. But Schlumberger is up 34% from its Jan. 20 low of 59.60. Halliburton (HAL) is up 48% from its January lows and Baker Hughes nearly 24%, even as Halliburton's proposed Baker Hughes buy faces regulatory objections in the U.S. and likely Europe.Halliburton late Friday delayed its Q1 earnings report from April 25 to May 3, citing an April 30 deadline for its Baker Hughes deal. Halliburton said Q1 revenue was $4.2 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates, and it's taking a $2.1 billion restructuring charge. Halliburton stock rose fractionally.Baker Hughes reports earnings Wednesady.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are up roughly 22% and 35%, respectively from their 2016 lows. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are among several oil majors reporting earnings next week. So do Halliburton and Baker Hughes.

198,HAL,"Schlumberger (SLB) reported first-quarter results above analyst estimates Thursday but sees the industry ""deteriorating"" further in Q2.The oilfield service provider's Q1 earnings fell 62% to 40 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 39 cents. Revenue fell 36% to $6.52 billion, slightly above views for $6.51 billion.Schlumberger shares fell 1% in after-hours treading in the stock market today and ended the regular session down 1%.Q1 North American revenue sank 55% as U.S. land rig counts fell on budget cuts from customers. International revenue dropped 28% on budget cuts and activity disruptions. The company said revenues in the Latin America and Middle East & Asia regions fell significantly.Oil majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and shale players like Continental Resources (CLR) have scaled back capital spending as oil prices remain low, reducing demand for Schlumberger and other service providers.CEO Paal Kibsgaard said in the earnings release that global spending reductions from oil companies are nearing 25% this year with reductions between 40% and 50% in North America and 20% internationally.“During the first quarter of 2016, the decline in global activity and the rate of activity disruption reached unprecedented levels as the industry displayed clear signs of operating in a full-scale cash crisis,"" Kibsgaard said. ""Budgeted E&P spend fell again and substantially affected our operating results. This environment is expected to continue deteriorating over the coming quarter given the magnitude and erratic nature of the disruptions in activity.""Rival oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) will announce Q1 results April 25. Analysts see EPS plunging 90% to 5 cents and revenue falling 40.6% to $4.18 billion. Baker Hughes (BHI) will announce earnings Wednesday.Halliburton shares were flat in late trade.
"
199,HAL,"Oilfield service provider Schlumberger (SLB) is seen reporting a fourth straight quarter of accelerating profit declines when it issues first-quarter results Thursday, as the energy sector continues to get hammered by lower oil prices.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings to sink 62% to 40 cents per share on revenue of $6.51 billion. The 62% plunge also looks to be the sharpest drop of the recent oil-price downturn, as yearly comparisons start to improve later this year. It follows prior earnings drops of 57%, 48%, 36% and 12% over the previous four quarters, respectively.Last week, Schlumberger reaffirmed its revenue outlook of $6.5 billion for Q1, down 37% from the year-earlier period.The company warned last month that the exploration and production industry it serves ""finds itself in the deepest financial crisis on record, with profitability and cash flow at unsustainable levels for most oil and gas operators, which in turn has created an equally dramatic situation for the service industry.""Oil majors like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and shale players like Continental Resources (CLR) have scaled back capital spending as oil prices remain low, reducing demand for Schlumberger and other service providers.Oil prices had been climbing since February on optimism that Saudi Arabia, Russia and other top producers would agree on an output freeze. But a deal couldn't be reached Sunday in Doha, Qatar, as Saudi Arabia refused to participate unless Iran participated as well.Since then, Saudi Arabia and Russia have even hinted that they might increase oil output, putting further pressure on prices and U.S. shale companies.Iran also wants to boost production now that sanctions over its nuclear program have been lifted, and reports say Schlumberger could be returning to the country by purchasing former subsidiary Well Services of Iran. But the head of Well Services denied the reports.Analysts expect a rough quarter for the energy sector overall. Earnings of companies listed on the S&P 500 energy index are seen falling 107.1% for the first three months of 2016 vs. a year before, the Financial Times said, citing S&P Global Market Intelligence.Rival oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) will announce Q1 results April 25. Analysts see EPS plunging 90% to 5 cents and revenue falling 40.6% to $4.18 billion.Earlier this month, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to block the merger between Halliburton and Baker Hughes (BHI), saying the deal would increase prices and stifle competition, and that Halliburton didn’t offer enough divestitures to ease antitrust concerns.

201,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) are making a last-ditch effort to get regulator approval for their $34 billion merger as they look to sell some businesses to private-equity firm Carlyle Group (CG), according to a report by the Wall Street Journal Thursday.The oilfield service providers are in serious, but not exclusive, talks with Carlyle for assets that could be worth more than $7 billion, sources told the newspaper.Earlier, Halliburton and Baker Hughes had been courting General Electric (GE) to offload the assets, as GE looks to expand its industrial core amid its shift away from finance. But some of the sources said that GE was still in consideration.Halliburton shares were up 0.2% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes rose 4.6%, Carlyle lost 1.1%, and GE edged up less than 0.1%.Last week, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to block the merger, saying the deal would increase prices and stifle competition, and that Halliburton didn’t offer enough divestitures to ease antitrust concerns.Still, the proposed divestiture might not be enough to satisfy the Justice Department. The merger, announced in November 2014, would combine the No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield service providers, with only Schlumberger (SLB) as a major rival. Schlumberger shares dipped 0.3% Thursday.If Halliburton can’t get the deal to close, it must pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes.

Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in slightly lower than Tuesday's level. Nasdaq volume rose a bit.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for May delivery jumped $1.86, or 5.2%, to $37.75 a barrel after the U.S. government reported an unexpected drop in crude inventories.Biotechs did the heavy lifting in the Nasdaq.

205,HAL,"The Justice Department is poised to sue to block Halliburton's (HAL) $35 billion deal to acquire rival Baker Hughes (BHI), according to media reports Tuesday.A lawsuit could be filed as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported. Reuters and Dow Jones also reported the government's planned action.The merger deal of the No. 2 and 3 oilfield service providers had drawn intense scrutiny, and proposals for selling off assets didn't satisfy regulators.Baker Hughes shares fell 5.1% on the stock market today. Halliburton shares rose 1.2%. Rival Schlumberger (SLB) edged up 2 cents to 72.66.The deal originally was announced in November 2014, but government officials have been skeptical, concerned that it would shrink the industry down to two major players: the merged Baker Hughes-Halliburton and Schlumberger.Halliburton reportedly has offered to sell $7.5 billion in assets, but regulators are said to want it to sell assets with approximately $10 billion in revenue rather than divesting operations in smaller pieces.That's a tall order since oil prices plunged, leaving giants like General Electric (GE) as one of the few companies able to make such a purchase. GE shares dipped 0.8% Tuesday.Under the terms of its merger deal, Halliburton must pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes.The Justice Department also is suing hedge fund ValueAct, alleging that it took large stakes in Halliburton and Baker Hughes with plans to influence the deal but didn’t disclose its stake to regulators.Meanwhile, European Union officials have repeatedly delayed their decision on whether to approve the merger. Last month, EU officials set a July 11 deadline on whether to give their approval to the merger.The deal has already received regulatory clearances in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Turkey, according to Halliburton.

206,HAL,"The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Wednesday to block the $34 billion Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI) merger, saying the deal would increase prices and stifle competition.Justice officials said that Halliburton didn't offer enough divestitures to ease antitrust concerns and that the merger would eliminate competition for 23 products or services. Halliburton had said it could sell up to $7.5 billion in assets to meet the department’s concerns.""The proposed deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes would eliminate vital competition, skew energy markets and harm American consumers,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a prepared statement. ""Our action makes clear that the Justice Department is committed to vigorously enforcing our antitrust laws. In the days ahead, we will continue to stand up for fair deals and free markets, and for the American people we are privileged to serve.""But Halliburton and Baker Hughes shot back, saying the merger would lower prices by combining services under one company and that they believe Halliburton offered to sell enough assets in a ""significantly enhanced"" divestiture package to meet the Justice Department's concerns.""The proposed merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes is pro-competitive and will allow the companies’ customers to benefit from a more flexible, innovative and efficient oilfield services company,"" the two companies said in a joint prepared statement. ""The transaction will provide customers with access to high quality and more efficient products and services, and an opportunity to reduce their cost per barrel of oil equivalent.""The merger, announced in November 2014, would combine the No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield service providers, with only Schlumberger (SLB) as a major rival. Halliburton shares jumped 5.9% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes soared 8.8% -- though after falling nearly 6% Tuesday. Schlumberger shares were up 0.7%.If Halliburton can’t get the deal to close, it must pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes. That means Baker Hughes could leave negotiations at the end of the month if the judicial review extends beyond April 30.Deutsche Bank downgraded Baker Hughes to hold from buy and slashed its price target to 43 from 78, saying that Baker Hughes and Halliburton have a strong case against the Justice Department's lawsuit, but that the merger's changes of closing are ""a coin flip at best.""If the deal falls apart, the two majors could still spark a round of consolation in the industry, buying up smaller rivals like Oceaneering International (OII) and Flotek Industries (FTK), according to Stephens analyst Matthew Marietta in a Bloomberg article. General Electric (GE) also is looking at ways to expand its focus in oil and gas.GE shares edged 0.3% lower. Oceaneering shares rose 0.3% and Flotek 1%.

The company sees no significant recovery until next year at the earliest.""This 'hold-your-breath and-hope-for better-times-soon' playbook has in the past allowed the industry to live through shorter-term demand downturns while waiting for business to return to normal,"" Schlumberger said in a presentation. The major difference in the current industry situation is that we are unlikely to see oil prices returning to the $100 level because this downturn is not driven by lower demand or by external factors. It is instead an immediate result of OPEC’s decision to protect market share rather than oil price which clearly demonstrates that they still have a firm grip on the global E&P industry.""Schlumberger said E&P operators are cutting costs over the last 18 months by squeezing services firms, not greater efficiency.""The unsustainable financial situation of the service industry together with the massive capacity reductions mean that the cost savings from lower service pricing should largely be reversed when activity levels start picking up.""Along with massive capital spending cuts, that suggests that U.S. shale operators will not be able to boost output significantly any time soon, even if some wells are profitable at the current U.S. crude price of about $40 a barrel. Baker Hughes (BHI) on Friday reported the U.S. rig count rising by 1 last week, but that was the first rise in 2016 and from the lowest levels in years.Transocean (RIG), a major offshore rig operator, sees 2016 and 2017 as very difficult years, with rig rates not reviving substantially until the end of the decade.Despite its Q1 warning and grim industry forecast, Schlumberger shares rose 1.9% on the stock market Monday. Schlumberger fell 1.6% in late afternoon trade Tuesday as U.S. oil prices dipped 0.2% to $41.45 a barrel and Brent crude rose 0.6%to $41.79.Baker Hughes and Halliburton (HAL) fell 1.3% and 1.5%, respectively, Tuesday intraday. The European Union delayed its review of Halliburton's proposed Baker Hughes buy for a third time on Monday.Transocean shares fell 4.9% Tuesday afternoon after losing 2.3% Monday.

209,HAL,"As the tech industry gets ever more data-driven, a “Ph.D. in economics” is more often becoming a job requirement in the sector.Established giants and newer tech firms alike are enlisting economists to help with many crucial tasks. Companies that employ economists include Amazon.com (AMZN), Airbnb, IBM (IBM), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), eBay (EBAY), Yahoo (YHOO) and Uber.Hal Varian was a consultant for Google (now part of Alphabet (GOOGL)) going back to 2002, becoming its chief economist in 2007. And the trend has grown, as tech economists say there’s more demand and appreciation for the work they do.Amazon is a leading employer of economists, with “dozens” aboard, says Susan Athey, a professor of the economics of technology at Stanford Graduate School of Business and a longtime consultant to Microsoft. Amazon didn’t respond to a request for comment.Athey says Microsoft is another company with “at least a dozen” economists on staff. She knows of nearly 100 economists employed by tech firms, the big majority joining after 2010.Tech company economists must combine theory with practical application.“We use economic principles and economic theory, but we also use experiments, statistical data and other aspects of the real world to build systems that work and will stand the test of time,” said Preston McAfee, chief economist at Microsoft.These systems can address fundamental business questions, such as setting prices, as well as challenges brought about or exacerbated by the rapid rate of innovation in the tech industry. As firms expand, economists are increasingly working on public policy issues, including privacy issues and intellectual property topics.Economists have to analyze large amounts of data. Much of their value to tech firms is in helping to connect the engineering side with the business side.“Economists are trained in the intuition and goals of business, but they are also comfortable with data, statistics and the technical aspects of running a business,” Athey said. “A successful economist is multilingual.”A tech firm today might hire an economist when they struggle to navigate a new marketplace.“You might confront a business problem where you realize there’s no off-the-shelf HBS (Harvard Business School) case study or McKinsey rule of thumb you can apply to manage your unique marketplace,” Athey said. “It’s really an economics research project to figure out the business practices to operate the new platform.”Economists have helped Uber develop its “surge” pricing algorithm -- basically, when demand exceeds supply, Uber’s prices rise -- and have led Airbnb to offer professional photography services for hosts. While the platforms are new, these problems come down to supply and demand.One of the biggest and most famous contributions of a tech economist is Varian’s work on AdWords. As his first assignment, Varian helped Google develop its auction-based approach to selling ads, still by far the company’s largest source of revenue.For economists, the fast-paced environment and variety of challenges are among the big draws of working in the tech industry.“I’m in this business because I don’t like routine. I relish having new challenges,” said McAfee. McAfee had been a professor for 28 years before leaving academia to join the tech industry in 2007 as chief economist at Yahoo.At Microsoft, McAfee is working to develop a new business model to sell technology developed by research units directly to customers, among various other tasks.“It’s a new take on a classic research model, and I’m happy to be a part of it,” he said.Varian had intended to stay at Google for a year while on leave from the University of California, Berkeley, but the excitement of the work at Google drew him away from academia.“We’ve got a great environment here where you have the infrastructure for developing projects and products,” said Varian. “Most of the things we’ve done have been of considerable interest to the company.”Besides AdWords, his other key tasks at Google included helping with its unusual “Dutch auction” style of IPO in 2004, designed to open the process to everyone and not just to favored clients of underwriters. He also collaborates with Google X, the company’s “moonshot” R&D factory, to help develop some of the business models.Michael Bailey, economics research manager at Facebook, looks at academia and tech as a difference between breadth and depth.“In industry, you are working on a larger variety of problems and projects and often need to take more multidisciplinary approaches so you are effectively building more breadth,” Bailey told IBD via email.Bailey, who joined Facebook directly after finishing his Ph.D., said his team is growing and that he expects the tech industry to continue hiring economists at a fast pace.Varian agrees. “A lot of people have developed an appreciation for the kind of economic analysis we do,” he said.The interest is mutual. Within economics, the community of people who study the high-tech economy has grown from a very small number to hundreds across academia, business and government over the last 10 years, Varian says.“We’re developing a new field of practicing economics in the real world,” said Microsoft's McAfee. “Some of our big successes have been in auctions and pricing, but there are many more of those to come. And I think that’s a very cool thing to be a part of.”

210,HAL,"Air Force 1st Lt. Gail Halvorsen had no intention of creating an international sensation when he dropped some candy from his plane to kids in Berlin in July 1948.Flying loads of food, clothing, medicine and fuel into West Berlin during the Soviet blockade, Halvorsen took time out to shoot photos at the airport.Suddenly he saw children on the other side of a fence at the end of the landing strip. They asked him questions in English about the supplies being airlifted in, and he decided to light up their desperate lives by dropping candy to them on his next flight.His Operation Little Vittles ultimately brought 23 tons of donated chocolate, raisins, chewing gum and other treats, making him a humanitarian hero.“Gail Halvorsen is remembered fondly as the Raisin Bomber by a generation of Germans because he not only delivered critical supplies and treats, but he represented immense and basic humanity and empathy, overcoming the dark passions of wartime,” Vejas Liulevicius, author of the Teaching Co. audiovisual course “A History of Eastern Europe,” told IBD.Now 95 and living in Utah in the warm months and Arizona in winter, Halvorsen is no longer doing interviews, but he remains active helping people. Family and friends maintain his Facebook page and websites like wigglywings.weebly.com.Gail Seymour “Hal” Halvorsen was born in Salt Lake City in 1920 and grew up poor on farms in Utah and Idaho. Cash was especially hard to come by in northern Utah in the spring of 1939 when he was 18, so he worked 10 hours a day doing the backbreaking work of thinning sugar beets.“Every once in a while, the sound of an aircraft would come over that quiet valley,” Halvorsen wrote in ""The Berlin Candy Bomber.” “I had scarcely been out of the area, but my mind was free, flying to faraway places with strange-sounding names.”The next year, the demand for more civilian pilots in anticipation of war caused the Federal Aviation Administration to set up noncollege programs, and he won a scholarship for one of the 10 openings against 120 applicants. He received his license in September 1941 and joined the Civilian Air Patrol. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December prompted him to enter what was then the Army Air Corps cadet program at Utah State University in May the next year. (The corps would be renamed the Army Air Forces, and then later the Air Force.)Halvorsen's active duty began in March 1943, but he didn’t earn his silver wings until June the following year, when he began flying C-47 cargo planes in the South Atlantic war theater. Afterward, he was assigned to Brookley Air Force Base in Mobile, Ala., where he flew the much larger C-74, which could carry 50,000 tons.In July 1948, his commander called an emergency meeting of all pilots. Two weeks earlier, the communists imposed blockades of roads from West Germany 110 miles to West Berlin to force the city to join East Germany.Now 2.5 million West Berliners were isolated. However, air corridors were still open by treaty. Halvorsen was among those selected to crew four C-54s that would fly immediately to Rhein-Main Air Base near Frankfurt, West Germany.His first 280-mile flight from Rhein-Main to Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin came the day after he arrived in Europe. His plane carried 138 sacks of flour for Operation Vittles, while the Americans were warned to stay in the 20-mile-wide corridor and to be prepared for getting buzzed by Soviet fighters.Halvorsen's target was a city devastated by World War II bombing just a few years before.“As we looked down right over Berlin, it just took our breath away,” wrote Halvorsen. “Nothing I had read, heard or seen prepared me for the desolate, ravaged sight below … a mottled mass of total destruction.”On another visit, a driver took him on a jeep tour of the city, and he ended up at the perimeter fence of Tempelhof shooting pictures of planes landing. He was impressed that, though hungry, the 30 children didn’t ask for anything. He had only a couple of sticks of gum and tore them in half, thinking they would fight over them, but the four who took them were allowed to enjoy their treat.When he told the kids he’d drop some candy next time, they asked in English how they’d know which plane was his. He said he would rock his wings from side to side before tossing out boxes attached to little parachutes.With Halvorsen as good as his word, crowds of children grew as the flights continued once a week. He soon had nicknames like “Uncle Wiggly Wings,” “The Candy Bomber” and “Chocolate Flier.”His crewmates donated their rations and made parachutes of handkerchiefs and clothing. Word spread, and other troops chipped in. Kids began writing Tempelhof, sending back the parachutes with special requests.Halvorsen knew that any deviation from the basic mission wasn’t allowed. Pilots were supposed to fly in a straight line from Rhein-Main to one of three airports on the free side of Berlin.The commander of the entire Berlin Airlift was the humorless logistics genius William Tunner, a major general with the Air Force who worked 18 hours a day and had no hobbies. Under his guidance, flights eventually were landing almost every minute around the clock.Halvorsen and his comrades faced disciplinary action after the piles of letters came to the attention of Tunner.Halvorsen was told to see the commander. The young officer dreaded the meeting, but to his delight, Tunner liked the good publicity and told him to carry on.“Soon after, the Air Force officially adopted the name Operation Little Vittles for the candy drops and provided two German secretaries to help deal with the mountain of fan mail,” wrote Michael Tunnell in “Candy Bomber.” “It didn’t take long for the crowds of kids and their parents at the end of the runway at Tempelhof to grow too large … so he changed the parachute drops to random spots all over West Berlin, such as parks, playgrounds, cemeteries and schoolyards. This led to letters from East Berlin children, because the Berlin Wall didn’t yet exist, so children in the Soviet sector were dashing across the boundary to snap a few parachutes.”U.S. companies began donating large quantities of their products (including 5 million chocolate bars), and individuals and groups sent treats of all kinds as more pilots got involved in the special drops. Halvorsen was ordered to return to Mobile in January 1949, but others carried on the work he started.The flights into Berlin bringing everything from vegetables to coal continued around the clock, seven days a week. They also brought out 88,000 tons of goods manufactured in Berlin, allowing 935,000 people to remain employed. The Soviets ended the blockade in May 1949, though Airlift flights continued until September to build up material reserves in case the communists closed the city again.“Gail Halvorsen demonstrated that hearts and minds can be won, that the United States can obtain geostrategic goals without firing a shot,” said David Rigby, author of “No Substitute for Victory.” “As the representative of everything that was right about the Marshall Plan and the Airlift, it can be convincingly argued that Halvorsen and the candy he delivered to the children of Berlin did more to keep communism in check than did the entire Vietnam War.”In April 1949, Halvorsen married Alta Jolley, and they would have five children. He earned a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering in 1952 from the University of Florida, then worked for two decades for Air Force Systems Command, with duties in the space program. He later moving to Ogden, Utah, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.He returned as a colonel to command Tempelhof in the early 1970s. Then in 1974, he retired as colonel, with over 8,000 flying miles logged.He served as assistant dean of student life at Brigham Young University, and he and Alta became missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in England and Russia.He was hardly done flying. He dropped supplies over Bosnia in 1994 and re-enacted the candy drops for the 40th and 50th anniversaries of the Berlin Airlift. He remains a beloved figure in Germany.Alta died in 1999, and five years later Halvorsen married Lorraine Pace.Started the operation to drop candy to kids during the Berlin Airlift.Overcame: Logistical challenges of getting supplies and using tiny parachutes.Lesson: Delight your audience with creative solutions.“Give service to others if you seek genuine fulfillment.”

211,HAL,"A new sheriff is en route, but that hasn't stopped the old sheriff from swinging his corporate billy club around town.The subject is company mergers and the instances in which the administration of President Barack Obama -- who promised to ""reinvigorate"" federal antitrust enforcement on the campaign trail back in 2008 -- is cracking down are piling up. This week, Obama's Justice Department sued to block the $35 billion merger of Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) over antitrust concerns.Also this week, Obama said the Treasury Department had taken further steps to curb tax inversions by which U.S. companies buy a foreign target and then re-domicile to avoid higher taxes. That scuttled a major acquisition on Wednesday as drugmakers Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) called off their $150 billion deal.There also are several other instances in recent weeks and months when the administration has taken aim at big business. So, what gives? Is it a product of last year's robust M&A environment, which saw $4.3 trillion in global deals announced, or symptoms of a White House that critics have accused of being anti-business?""They’re definitely getting more aggressive,"" Max Jacobs, an analyst at London-based investment research house Edison, said of the administration. ""Historically, Obama has been a bit more on the liberal government intervention side of things.""Take the Pfizer-Allergan merger. The deal would have resulted in U.S.-based Pfizer relocating its headquarters to low-tax Ireland to benefit from that nation's 12% corporate tax rate. By doing so, it would have bypassed U.S. rates of 35%, the highest in the industrialized world.Terminating a deal that had been in the works for months, Pfizer now will pay Ireland-based Allergan a breakup fee of $150 million.""There is a political calculation here,"" said Dane Hamilton, editor at Mergermarket, speaking of tax-inversion deals. ""Obviously, the Obama administration would like to stop companies from moving overseas because they generate a lot of tax dollars.""Still, Obama's pending departure in January may not bring much relief. In terms of a friendlier face when it comes to M&A, there is a dearth of obvious presidential candidates at the moment.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's front-runner for president, wants to crack down on inversions, while fellow White House Democratic hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders has called the practice a ""tax-scam."" Meanwhile, Republican front-runner Donald Trump and party rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas propose lowering U.S. taxes to ward off inversions, but aren't coming out in support of them.Still, clamping down on tax inversions won't solve the corporate tax code's underlying problems, said Lisa De Simone, professor of accounting at Stanford University.""Our tax system very much put these incentives in place,"" she said. She added, though, that it's becoming more difficult to get inversion deals done.Tax inversions aren't the only target, though. The vigilant antitrust watchman that is the Obama administration has taken aim elsewhere.In addition to antitrust concerns over the Baker Hughes-Halliburton deal, which would combine the world's No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield-services firms, the Justice Department took Electrolux (ELUXY) to trial late last year, causing General Electric (GE) to back out of a $3.3 billion deal to sell its appliances unit. And the Federal Trade Commission has taken Office Depot (ODP) and Staples (SPLS) to trial to block the $6.3 billion deal between the two biggest office-supply chains.There's more. Last year, the administration quashed the $45 billion Comcast (CMCSA)-Time Warner Cable (TWC) merger, which would have combined the nation's two largest cable television companies. Yet in 2010, it approved Live Nation Entertainment’s (LYV) merger with Ticketmaster.Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, which favors more aggressive antitrust law enforcement, said the size of some of the companies merging raises ""red flags for enforcers.""But deals are still being struck despite politicians' griping.Major health insurers Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) combined in a $37 billion deal, and Anthem (ANTM) agreed to buy Cigna (CI) last year for $48.4 billion. The world's two largest beer makers, Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) and SABMiller, agreed to combine for $105 billion.For now, though, the old sheriff has a free hand, said Edison's Jacobs.""(Obama) has the benefit of not having to stand for election,"" he said.

212,HAL,"Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN) confirmed Wednesday that they are ending their $160 billion merger agreement after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb tax inversion deals Monday.Ireland-based Allergan rose 3.5% to 244.74 on the stock market today. CEO Brenton Saunders told CNBC that Allergan has a bright future as a standalone firm. Allergan plunged 14.8% Tuesday to 236.55, hitting the lowest levels since late 2014, amid concerns that the new rules imperiled the deal.Pfizer rose 5% Wednesday after gaining 2.1% to 31.36 on Tuesday.""Pfizer Inc. today announced that the merger agreement between Pfizer and Allergan plc has been terminated by mutual agreement of the companies,"" the drug giant said in a statement. ""The decision was driven by the actions announced by the U.S. Department of Treasury on April 4, 2016, which the companies concluded qualified as an ""Adverse Tax Law Change"" under the merger agreement.""U.S. companies have a strong incentive to redomicile overseas to reduce their exposure to America's unusually high corporate tax rates and global reach. Pfizer's board reported voted to scrap the deal given that there would no longer be tax benefits.Saunders said the new rules blindsided Allergan, and felt that they unfairly targeted his compnay, though it was not named specifically. The Treasury set restrictions on""serial inverters"" -- and Allergan has a history of inversion deals. Allergan is run from New Jersey, but has its official headquarters in Dublin.Pfizer will pay $150 million in merger-related expenses.Pfizer CEO Ian Reed said in a statement the drug giant may go ahead with a corporate split: ""We plan to make a decision about whether to pursue a potential separation of our innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2016""The Obama administration has become more aggressive going after big mergers. The Justice Department is suing to block the merger of Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI), which said they'll fight the DOJ's action.  But Baker Hughes shares rebounded 8.8% Wednesday after sliding 5.1% on Tuesday on reports that the DOJ would take action.

Weatherford stock dropped 3.2%.If Halliburton can't get the deal to close, it must pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes, so Baker Hughes could leave negations at the end of the month if the DOJ doesn't reach a decision by then.Regulators have been skeptical of the deal since the beginning, concerned that it would shrink the industry down to two major players: Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton-Baker Hughes. Baker Hughes has been been trading at a significant discount to Halliburton’s offer price.Schlumberger stock edged up 0.7%.The deal isn't facing push-back in just the U.S. -- European antitrust officials are to decide by July 11 on the merger, which has has already received regulatory clearance in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Turkey, according to Halliburton.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Overall first-quarter layoffs were up 31.8% from a year ago.""It is not just the energy sector that is seeing heavier job cuts, said John Challenger, the outplacement firm's chief executive.

217,HAL,"The Treasury Department may have squelched drug giant Pfizer’s (PFE) bid to take over Ireland-based Allergan (AGN), but ETF investors needn't fear.The new federal rules don't ice over the broader merger market, says Sal Bruno, chief investment officer of IndexIQ, the firm behind the largest merger-focused ETF.The $160 billion Pfizer-Allergan merger deal was widely seen as another attempt by a large U.S. company to move its legal domicile overseas and avoid America's steep corporate tax rates. The new rules make these so-called corporate inversions more difficult and potentially less profitable.However, ""tax inversion deals make up a small percentage of the total merger market,"" Bruno said. Most merger deals focus on opportunities for synergies and growth, he added.The Pfizer-Allergan kibosh hurts the merger industry from an ""optics standpoint,"" according to Bruno. Tactics to dodge corporate taxes have come in for flak recently from President Barack Obama and presidential candidates on both sides of the political divide.IQ Merger Arbitrage (MNA) dumped 1.4% Tuesday following the news and extended losses on the stock market today.This exchange traded fund invests in global companies that are targets of publicly announced takeovers. It rebalances monthly and uses a liquidity-based weighting method.Allergan is a top five stock holding in this exchange traded fund, with a 7% portfolio weighting.MNA has coasted along with far less volatility than the benchmark S&P 500 in the past year. Its 2.8% gain in the first quarter came in a very volatile period for the equity market.That performance helped to cushion Tuesday's blow.MNA was still up 1.35% for the year through April 5. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) has added 0.67%.The challenges for merger ETFs extend beyond the Pfizer-Allergan debacle.The Obama administration has taken a more aggressive stance on big mergers. It's suing to block the $35 billion merger of oil majors Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Staples’ (SPLS) bid for rival office supplier Office Depot (ODP) is also under scrutiny.Even more worrisome, deal activity is showing signs of cooling off after a record year for M&A in 2015.The U.S. recorded 1,007 deals cumulatively worth $241.5 billion in the first quarter, down 33% from 1,250 deals worth $361.3 billion in Q1 2015, according to intelligence service Mergermarket.Bruno believes the pace of M&A will remain brisk for the near future.Interest rates remain low, making it easier to borrow money to buy other companies. In a low-growth climate, acquisitions can add growth if a company can't generate growth on its own. And corporate balance sheets and cash flows are healthier than they have been in decades.""There's ample deal flow out there,"" Bruno said. ""We have a very positive outlook for merger-arbitrage as a whole.""Most challenging of all, perhaps, ETF investors continue to be wary of more niche products.MNA falls into the ""liquid alternative"" fund category: it aims to diversify a portfolio made up mostly of stocks and bonds. It's a category that hasn't grown tremendously in the ETF space, Bruno said.MNA debuted in 2009 and holds $127.7 million in assets. ProShares Merger (MRGR) launched in 2012 and holds $8.2 million.Despite the proliferation of thematic new products, plain-vanilla ETFs are dominant.""Investors will continue to focus most of their time and attention, as they well should, on very low-cost, broad, very well-diversified market exposures,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, said in a recent interview.However, Bruno expects liquid-alt ETFs to take off as people get more comfortable with their diversification benefits.""We will see growth going forward,"" he said.

218,HAL,"European antitrust regulators on Monday delayed their review of Halliburton’s (HAL) $35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes (BHI) for a third time.The European Commission said important data about the merger between the two oilfeld service providers weren’t provided.""Once the missing information is supplied by the parties, the clock is restarted, and the deadline for the Commission's decision is then adjusted accordingly,"" an EC spokesman said in an email to Reuters.Halliburton shares closed up 0.2% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes shares fell 0.8%.The European Commission stopped its investigation into the companies on Feb. 18 to get more information from them and then restarted the probe on March 8, saying a decision was expected by July 11.Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are concerned that a merger between the No. 2 and No. 3 service providers would reduce competition. Schlumberger (SLB) is the current market leader.In January, Halliburton said it would offer a “substantial remedies package that it believes will address any substantive competition concerns.”But the U.S. Justice Department is reportedly pressuring Halliburton to shed more assets as part of its own review of the deal.General Electric (GE) and Weatherford International (WFT) could be buyers for some of the assets Halliburton needs to shed to get antitrust approval.The deal has already received regulatory clearances in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Turkey, according to Halliburton.Schlumberger shares rose 1.9%. GE added 0.55%, and Weatherford shares edged up 0.7%.

219,HAL,"U.S. oil futures topped $41 a barrel intraday, but reversed lower falling back below $40 as Baker Hughes (BHI) reported the U.S. oil rig count rose for the first time in 2016.West Texas Intermediate closed down 1.9% to $39.44 a barrel after rising to a 2016 high of $41.20 intraday. On Thursday, U.S. crude topped $40 for the first time this year.Brent crude fell 0.8% to $41.20 after setting a 2016 peak of $42.54 intraday.U.S. oil rig counts have plunged over the past year as lower oil prices make new drilling unprofitable. Crude prices have rebounded, but it's unclear when shale companies  would be willing to step up activity. Continental Resources (CLR) has stopped all new activity in the Bakken Shale, as Continental and other companies have slashed capital spending.Even if new shale wells would be profitable at $40, companies know that a mini-boomlet could quickly boost supply and crater prices. With capital budgets slashed and crews cut, it could take months to significantly ramp up activity.So even though the increased rig count is marginally good news, oil services giants Schlumberger (SLB) fell 1.4% and Halliburton (HAL) 0.3% on the stock market today. Baker Hughes rose 1.15%. Halliburton is trying to buy Baker Hughes, but faces skeptical regulators.Continental Resources erased afternoon losses to rise 1.2%.Oil prices have been getting a lift from a weakened dollar after the Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday it likely wouldn’t raise interests rates before June. Oil is priced in dollars, so a weaker dollar helps boost prices by making it cheaper for holders of other currencies.Also Wednesday, Qatari Energy Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada said Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oil exporters — including Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members and non-OPEC countries — plan to meet April 17 in Qatar to discuss a possible oil-production freeze

220,HAL,"John Wayne wanted to be an attorney, not an actor.He had enjoyed the stage as a member of his high school drama club, but entered pre-law at the University of Southern California on a football scholarship.Then he broke his collarbone bodysurfing and had to drop out. He had been working part time as a prop boy and extra at Fox Film Corp. (later called 20th Century Fox) and began appearing in movies in 1926.Wayne would go on to star in dozens of classic motion pictures, especially Westerns, including “The Searchers,” “She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,” “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” and “True Grit,” for which he won the Academy Award for best actor.“My dad worked hard to improve his acting by constantly practicing,” his son, Ethan, president of John Wayne Enterprises in Newport Beach, Calif., told IBD. “He learned not only his lines, but the story backward and forward, knew the camera angles that would work best and was always prepared. He became a master craftsman of filmmaking.”Wayne (1907-79) was born in Winterset, Iowa, and named Marion Morrison after his grandfather, a Civil War hero.The family moved to the Los Angeles area, where the father tried ranching and failed, so took a job as a pharmacist in Glendale. Marion was teased about his “girl’s name,” so he was happy when firemen he visited with his dog Duke began calling him Big Duke.Fascinated by films being made in nearby hills, he began acting in high school. He also wrote for the school paper, was on the debate team, memorized poems of John Milton, became fluent in Latin and was president of his senior class, graduating in 1925.He started at USC in 1925, but the football scholarship covered only tuition and one meal a day, so his coach asked movie cowboy Tom Mix to get him a job at Fox. Mix and director John Ford were friends of Wyatt Earp and eventually introduced the youngster to the legendary lawman. Wayne began imitating his walk and talk.His first role as an uncredited extra was in 1926’s silent flick, “Brown of Harvard.” The next year, Wayne was in the accident that ended his college football career.In early 1930, director Raoul Walsh saw him moving studio furniture and decided Wayne had the strength and charisma to star in “The Big Trail,” the first sound spectacle, budgeted at $2 million (equal to $28 million now). Walsh also gave him his screen name, but while the movie was a critical success, it failed because of the Depression.Wayne started getting small roles in A pictures and the lead in Bs, mostly Westerns, in which he was mentored by master stuntman Yakima Canutt.In 1933, Wayne married Josephine Saenz, the first of his three wives of Hispanic descent (he was fluent in Spanish). They had two sons and two daughters, but divorced in 1945. He wed Esperanza Baur the next year, but they divorced eight years later. He married Pilar Pallette in 1954 and they would have a son and two daughters.In 1939 came his second break, when Ford cast him in “Stagecoach,” the first Western to have three-dimensional characters. It was nominated for an Oscar for best picture, but lost to “Gone With the Wind.”When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, Wayne expected to be drafted.“He was eager to join the service, but was old for a soldier at 34 and had four children, which earned a deferment that Republic Pictures’ boss Herbert Yates insisted he accept or be sued,” said Roger McGrath, author of “Gunfighters, Highwaymen and Vigilantes.” “But if he had taken a physical it would have revealed his broken collarbone, a chronically bad back from having done his own stunts and damage to his inner ear canal caused by staying underwater while filming ‘Reap the Wild Wind.’ With the help of Ford, however, he applied to the photographic unit of the Office of Strategic Services, but the acceptance letter wasn’t forwarded by his estranged wife, Josephine. However, director William Donovan did assign him to make observations of the men and officers during a USO tour of the southwest Pacific in 1943-44, for which he was given a certificate of temporary service for OSS.”Wayne also made morale-building pictures like “Flying Tigers,” “Fighting Seabees” and “Back to Bataan.” He would hail the heroes in later films like “They Were Expendable” and “Sands of Iwo Jima.”After the war ended in 1945, he went back to making Westerns, including classics like “Fort Apache,” “She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,” “Red River,” “Rio Grande” and “Rio Bravo.” His most notable was “The Searchers,” directed by Ford and released in 1956, which is No. 12 on the American Film Institute’s list of “100 Greatest American Films of All Time” (just ahead of “Star Wars”).“He personified for his fans the character he often played in Westerns, the great individualist working hard to survive and protect his family on the frontier,” said R.L. Wilson, author of ""The Peacemakers: Arms and Adventure in the American West.” “I knew Katharine Hepburn, who expressed how much of a pleasure it was to be on sets with him.”Wayne also did a favor for Ford, making a romance set in Ireland with Maureen O’Hara, 1952's “The Quiet Man,” which won Ford an Oscar as best director.After 12 years of preparation, Wayne felt ready to produce, direct and play the part of Davy Crockett in “The Alamo” in 1959. He regarded it as the greatest of all stories of American heroism, but found little interest from the studios. He borrowed against everything he owned to raise the $12 million (equal to $97 million today).But everything went wrong on location in Brackettville, Texas. He hired much of Ford’s crew, and Ford insisted on directing some scenes, almost none of which were used, at a cost of $250,000. A flood destroyed thousands of adobe huts that had been constructed. A fire burned up many of Wayne’s files. A cast member was murdered. It received mixed reviews when released in 1960, though the final attack by the Mexican army is stirring.Then Wayne discovered that his accountant had lost most of his remaining money through bad investments. He quickly signed a nonexclusive contract with Paramount Studios for 10 movies at $600,000 each (worth $5 million now).One of the first was “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance” in 1962. The same year, he starred in “The Longest Day,” a D-Day classic; “Hatari,” about the rescue of African animals; and the wide-screen epic “How the West Was Won.”“The Green Berets,” released in 1968, expressed Wayne’s view that the Vietnam War was necessary to stop communist expansion. It did well at the box office, if not with the critics.He pleased both critics and fans with 1969’s “True Grit,” which earned him $1.5 million (worth $10 million now) and the best actor Oscar.Wayne’s last movie was 1976's “The Shootist,” in which he gave one of his best performances.The 142 pictures in which he played the lead grossed $377 million worldwide (equivalent to $3 billion today). He appeared for 25 years, the most of any star, in the Top Ten Money Makers Poll -- a measure of ticket sales -- from 1949-74.He died of stomach cancer at age 72.“Whatever he played, the power of Wayne’s personality shone through -- clarity triumphant,” wrote Scott Eyman in “John Wayne: The Life and Legend.” “He played the kind of man he needed to believe in, the kind of man the audience needed to believe in, his own genre. . . . At his best, he was an American amalgam of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal and Falstaff, for our time, for all time --  larger than life, transcending death.”Superstar of motion pictures, especially Westerns and war movies.Overcame: Box office flops.Lesson: When you get knocked down, dust yourself off and move forward.“All I do is sell sincerity, and I’ve been selling the hell out of that ever since I started.”

221,HAL,"Shares of Halliburton (HAL), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) fell in the stock market today after the Obama administration outlined a proposed leasing program for 2017-2022 that bars offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean.Oilfield services specialist Halliburton lost 1.4%, rival Schlumberger (SLB) 0.3%, BP 1% and Royal Dutch Shell 0.6%.The announcement, made by the Department of the Interior, marks a reversal from an administration proposal made last year in which it appeared open to allowing drilling off parts of the East Coast after 2021.""The Proposed Program does not schedule any lease sales in the Mid- and South Atlantic Program Area due to current market dynamics, strong local opposition and conflicts with competing commercial and military ocean uses,"" the department said in a statement.“We heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the Atlantic coast,” Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said in the statement. “When you factor in conflicts with national defense, economic activities such as fishing and tourism, and opposition from many local communities, it simply doesn’t make sense to move forward with any lease sales in the coming five years.”Offshore driller Transocean (RIG) stumbled 2%. Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO) gained 0.55%, while London-based offshore driller Noble Corp. (NE) surrendered less than 0.1%.Drilling off the Atlantic has been banned in the U.S. for years but has been seen as potentially prime territory for oil extraction. Environmentalists have been opposed to any new drilling.

222,HAL,"Small business optimism fell to a two-year low in February, the National Federation of Independent Business said Tuesday. Owners of small firms reported hiring and compensation plans weakening sharply since the end of last year, the latest evidence that labor markets are not as healthy as official government data indicate.NFIB’s sentiment gauge fell one point to 92.9, the lowest since February 2014 and well below historical norms.""A ho-hum outcome this month confirms that the small business sector is not performing with any strength,"" said NFIB Chief Economist William Dunkelberg.A net 21% still see the economy weakening, the worst since late 2013. That’s not surprising, given that small firms have reported sales have been falling consistently since June 2012.A big shift so far this year is in labor markets. A net 10% of small businesses plan to add staff, down from 11% in January and 15% in December. That’s the lowest since last June.Meanwhile, small firms are rapidly scaling back plans to raise worker pay and benefits. A net 12% intend to increase compensation, the fewest since July 2013. That’s down from December’s 21%, which was the most since 2001. It’s unclear if minimum wage hikes or ObamaCare/health care premium increases taking effect Jan. 1 had boosted year-end compensation plans.Regardless, February’s NFIB data followed the February employment report, which showed that weekly earnings tumbled 0.5% vs. January. Hourly wages dipped 0.1%.The same report showed the U.S. adding 242,000 jobs last month while the labor force surged, so economists weren’t too concerned by the wage data.But tax withholding data suggest significant deterioration. Tax revenue withheld rose just 2.1% over the last four weeks vs. a year earlier, down from 4% at the start of the year and around 5% for much of 2015.Also, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing and nonmanufacturing surveys both indicated job declines.Announced layoff plans have been high, with the 12-month trailing average the highest since mid-2012. Halliburton (HAL), Yahoo (YHOO) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are among the major companies setting plans for job cuts in recent weeks.Halliburton said on Feb. 25 that it would cut 5,000 jobs, bringing total planned reductions to 26,000 since 2014's oil-prices plunge. Yahoo plans to cut 15% of its staff, while Wal-Mart is slashing payroll as it closes 154 stores.Energy, manufacturing and export sectors are struggling, affecting small firms directly or indirectly.In the NFIB survey, 12% of small businesses said finding qualified labor was their top problem, behind taxes and regulation. The number was down from 15% in January and 16% last September.One factor could be a recent rush into the workforce. In the last three months, 1.523 million people joined the labor force -- the best gain since March 2000, the very peak of the dot-com stock market bubble. The rise could be easing skilled labor shortages but also depressing wages.Another factor for weaker wages: In addition to weaker sales, a net 4% reported lower selling prices, the worst in more than 5 years.Image provided by Shutterstock.

223,HAL,"European antitrust officials are to decide on Halliburton’s (HAL) proposed purchase of Baker Hughes (BHI) by July 11.The European Commission stopped its investigation into the oil-field service providers on Feb. 18 to gather more information from the companies, but now the European Union's executive arm has resumed its probe of the $35 billion deal.Halliburton shares fell 3.6% to 34.56 in the stock market today. Baker Hughes stock was down 3.6% to 44.90. Oil prices retreated Tuesday. Lower oil prices have pressured the stocks, which peaked in mid-2014 along with crude futures. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have rallied in recent weeks with oil, moving back above their 50-day moving averages, but remain in a downtrend.In January, Halliburton said in a release that it plans to offer a “substantial remedies package that it believes will address any substantive competition concerns.”Last month, the New York Post reported that the Justice Department is putting pressure on Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets. Earlier, the DOJ had required Halliburton to sell $7.5 billion in assets, including its drilling assets, to a single buyer in order to get approval for the megamerger. Possible buyers included General Electric (GE), which is expanding its oil and gas operations as it divests its financial operations, and Weatherford International (WFT).GE shares dipped 0.8%. Weatherford shares plunged 11.4%.The deal has already received regulatory clearances in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Turkey, according to Halliburton. But U.S. and EU regulators worry that there will be a lack of competition if the  second- and third-largest oil-field service providers merge. Schlumberger (SLB) is the current leader.Schlumberger fell 4.2%.

224,HAL,"The U.S. added a lot more jobs than expected in February, easing fears that the economy is flirting with recession. That won't push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at this month's policy meeting, analysts said, but a move could be in play after that.U.S. employers added a net 242,000 jobs for the month, the Labor Department said Friday, ending a three-month string of decelerating gains. January's jobs gain was revised up to 172,000 from 151,000. December also was revised higher.Economists had expected a gain of 190,000 jobs. February's total was solidly above the high end of the consensus range of 217,000.The unemployment rate held steady at 4.9%, even as the labor force participation rate rose to 62.9%, continuing a gradual rise from a decades-low 62.4% in September.The number of people entering the workforce swelled by 555,000, the most since January 2015. The three-month average of nearly 508,000 was the highest since March 2000, as Americans finally decided to enter the workforce in greater numbers.But workers took home smaller weekly paychecks.The average workweek fell by two-tenths of an hour to 34.4 hours per week, below estimates.Average hourly earnings fell 0.1%, also missing forecasts. Prior estimates for December and January were cut by 1 cent for each month. Year over year, hourly pay grew 2.2%, down from 2.5% in January and 2.6% in December. Still, cheap gasoline is keeping inflation-adjusted wage gains high, supporting consumer spending.The mixed data suggest that a Fed rate hike this month is not on the table analysts say.""There are no signs there has been a meaningful pickup in wage growth that would make them act sooner than later,"" said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial Corp. ""It gives them latitude to do nothing in March.""The central bank took heat for its December rate hike, its first in nearly a decade, amid sluggish U.S. and global data. The criticism intensified as global financial markets buckled early this year.Stocks rallied modestly Friday, capping their third straight week of gains.Aggregate payrolls -- total hours worked multiplied by wages -- fell 0.5%, the biggest one-month drop since June 2009. Year over year, aggregate payrolls rose 3.8%, the smallest gain in two years.Private sector payrolls rose by 230,000 jobs, while governments added 12,000 positions. The service sector created 257,000 jobs, more than the overall employment gain, with education and health services adding 86,000 jobs.Construction payrolls rose by 19,000, the latest solid gain for that sector. But mining and natural resources cut 18,000 positions, bringing total job losses in that sector to 170,000 since September 2014. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 16,000 jobs after jumping 23,000 in January.Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) are among the energy companies that have announced layoffs in recent months.The recent downshift in wage gains could reflect a shift from higher-paying manufacturing and mining jobs to lower-paying service positions.""It kind of struck me that the jobs that are being produced aren’t strong, high-paying jobs,"" said Steve Kalayjian, chief market technician at KnowVera, a New York-based financial technology and research company. ""These are minimum-wage jobs, if not better.""Overall, the U.S. continues to outperform the rest of the globe. But there have been storm clouds elsewhere in the world.A strong dollar has hurt U.S. companies who sell their goods in foreign markets. China is signaling an economic slowdown. Brazilian GDP plunged nearly 6% during the fourth quarter and contracted 3.8% for all of last year. Europe and Japan continue to muddle along.An oversupply of oil coupled with weak demand has sent oil prices plunging. Bad loans to energy companies are weighing on banks, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which increased its Q1 energy loan-loss reserves to $1.5 billion.Finally, stock market volatility has hammered investors. JPMorgan has warned that the global rout in equities has caused a 20% drop in its trading revenue so far this year.

225,HAL,"The Institute for Supply Management's Non-Manufacturing Index fell for the fourth straight month to a two-year low in February, signaling slower growth and a slight decline in jobs.The service-sector gauge dipped just 0.1 point to 53.4, the lowest since February 2014 but better than estimates for 53.1. A reading above 50 indicates growth, while a reading below 50 signals contraction.The new orders gauge slowed by one point to 55.5. Business activity and production grew 3.9 points to 57.8. Inventories gained one point to 52.5.Employment fell into contraction territory for the first time in two years, falling to 49.7 from January's 52.1. The service sector accounts for the vast majority of job growth, especially with manufacturing employment flat or falling for much of the past year.Meanwhile, factory orders rose 1.6% in January, the Commerce Department said. That's less than expected but still the most in seven months, driven by demand in commercial aircraft. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, viewed as a gauge for business investment, rose 3.4%. Inventories fell for the seventh consecutive month.December's decline of 2.9% was left unrevised.Manufacturers such as General Electric (GE) and United Technologies (UTX) have suffered from a strong dollar and weak overseas demand.A struggling energy sector weighed on staff reductions last month, as Challenger reported 61,599 layoffs, down 18% from January's number. Energy industry layoffs were 25,051, up 24.6% from the previous month. Halliburton (HAL) announced new job cut plans last week. It has shed or will shed 22,000 employees worldwide since the price of crude oil began its collapse.

Broken down further, professional and business services added 59,000 jobs, up 55% from January. Trade/transportation/utilities added 20,000, down 30% from January.The 8,000 jobs added in the financial activities sector was the least since August. Bank of America (BAC) is reportedly planning investment banking cuts, according to various recent reports, after JPMorgan Chase (JPM) warned of a ""very tough"" quarter for investment banking.Manufacturing, battered by a strong dollar, weak global economic growth and an enervated energy sector, lost 8,900 jobs last month, the second-largest drop in five years. Halliburton (HAL) is among the companies who have announced fresh layoffs in recent days. Manufacturing employment rose 0.1% vs. a year earlier, the smallest gain since late 2010.But the overall goods sector increased jobs modestly, led by a gain in construction, which added 27,000 payrolls.Large businesses and small businesses added 76,000 jobs each, while medium-sized businesses added 62,000 jobs.ADP's report comes ahead of the Labor Department's employment report on Friday. Economists expect 190,000 non-farm payrolls were added in February. They see the unemployment rate holding at 4.9%.

Baker Hughes shares fell 2.6%. Schlumberger shares fell 1%. GE shares dipped 0.9%. Weatherford shares dipped 0.5%.In December, Halliburton and Baker Hughes extended the time period for closing their merger to April as discussions continued.On Thursday, Halliburton said that it would cut its workforce by 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs, as oil stays lower for longer.  The oil-field service provider has cut 22,000 employees or 25% of its workforce since 2014.Meanwhile, rival Schlumberger has laid off 34,000 workers, 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014 with 10,000 job cuts in the past quarter.Image provided by Shutterstock.

233,HAL,"The collapse in crude oil prices has slashed the U.S. oil rig count by 75%, but those expecting Texas to suffer an economic meltdown as it did during the 1980s should think again, economists say.First, the bad news. The Dallas Federal Reserve's region, which is more exposed to energy markets, had another bad month. While its general activity index improved slightly to -31.8 in February from -34.6 in January, it remains deep in contraction and at levels not seen since the recession.The production subindex was also up slightly but still negative, while gauges for new orders and employment were at their lowest since 2009.Layoffs in the energy sector began at the blue-collar level and are working their way up to the white-collar level, according to Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership.The Texas unemployment rate rose in December to 4.7%, thought it's still below the national average of 4.9%. A 70% plunge in crude oil prices since June 2014 has been a big culprit.Since 2014, Houston-based oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) has cut 22,000 employees worldwide, or 25% of its workforce. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), also based in Houston, has laid off 34,000 globally, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014.Energy's problems are also impacting everything from homebuilders to restaurants. During their most recent quarterly earnings reports, KB Home (KBH), PulteGroup (PHM) and Lennar (LEN) each reported weakness for homes in the Houston market.Meanwhile, Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported seeing some weakness in its Texas chains, and Polaris Industries (PII), a maker of all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, also found that oil and gas regions hurt Q4 earnings and predicted continued softness this year.So, while things are grim, it's important to keep some perspective. Texas has a population of more than 26 million people, spread out in 254 counties and living in several dozen metropolitan areas and countless rural communities. While Houston has a significant exposure to oil, major cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and El Paso do not.""The economic impact varies across the state,"" said Bud Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. ""The oil-producing regions of the state have been hit the hardest.""Texas also has a $16 billion rainy day fund, largely derived from the energy sector, which can cover any shortfalls in state tax revenue caused by the oil bust. Texas also relies less on oil and gas taxes than other energy-heavy peers do.The Lone Star State generates about 9% of its revenue from oil and gas taxes vs. more than 40% for states like Alaska and North Dakota.Texas is better suited to withstand sustained low prices than it was during the 1980s, when the bottom fell out of the oil market. With help from the rise of technology, health and other industries, the Texas economy is more diverse.Oil and gas represents about 14% of the state's economy vs. more than 20% in the 1980s, Comptroller Glenn Hegar told lawmakers last month.The Dallas-Fort Worth area, a laggard during the economic recovery after the recession, currently has thriving business services and technology sectors. Its tax incentives, major international airport, and affordable housing costs have attracted companies seeking to relocate their headquarters. For example, Toyota Motor (TMC) is moving its U.S. base to the Dallas suburb of Plano.The petrochemical sector, which often runs counter-cyclical to oil, is performing well, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Chevron (CVX) building projects in the Houston area.Lastly, limits on interstate banking helped exacerbate the economic crisis in Texas during the 1980s, when collapsing oil prices as well as overbuilding in commercial and residential real estate led to smaller Texas banks failing.Today, big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) have footholds in Texas. Although each lender has boosted its energy loan loss reserves (JPMorgan alone increased its reserve to $1.5 billion for Q1), sustained low oil prices are unlikely to lead to widespread banking failures.Like any industry during a downturn, the Texas oil sector will be forced to become more efficient.""The energy industry will be smaller,"" Jankowski said. ""It will find a way to produce the same amount of oil with fewer people and more technology.""

234,HAL,"Halliburton (HAL) announced another round of layoffs Thursday as oil stays lower for longer, but prices jumped as OPEC and non-OPEC members scheduled a production meeting for March.Halliburton said it would cut its workforce by 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs.  The oilfield service provider has cut 22,000 employees or 25% of its workforce since 2014. Halliburton also has been divesting assets to get European regulators to approve its acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI).Meanwhile, rival Schlumberger (SLB) has laid off 34,000 workers, 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014 with 10,000 job cuts in in the past quarter.Halliburton shares closed up 0.1% in the stock market today. Baker Hughes jumped 3.2%.  Schlumberger rose 0.2%.Crude futures were down for most of the day but quickly reversed on news of the March meeting. Brent oil finished up 2.6% at $35.29 per barrel, and U.S. crude settled up 2.9% to $33.07.Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino said he would meet with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Russia and Qatar next month to talk about freezing output at January levels, according to Bloomberg News.At the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston earlier this week, Saudi Oil Minster Ali al-Naimi said there would be another meeting but also said a production cut “is not going to happen.”While January saw record oil output from top producers, suggesting it would do little to ease the supply glut, markets have been encouraged by signs of any sort of cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC members.

235,HAL,"Big Government: The IRS admitted to Congress what many suspect: That its abysmal customer service and failure to protect taxpayer data are because it's diverted its resources to ObamaCare. Now it wants another billion.House Republicans were flabbergasted when Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen asked the House Appropriations Committee for another $1 billion for the IRS budget for fiscal 2017, following the $290 million increase he got in fiscal 2016. An extra billion is a 12% beef-up for the agency's budget.Seems the customer service is a shambles, with 8 million, or half, of calls from taxpayers seeking to comply with the law going unanswered. And for those who do get through, it takes an average of 23 minutes on hold.Cybersecurity has fallen apart, too, with hackers scooping up data in at least two major security breaches affecting 431,000 people based on the agency's failure to spend for vital upgrades. Koskinen said $900 million had been cut from that part of the budget -- and used for ObamaCare enforcement.""Congress, as I noted in my testimony, has underfunded ... the Affordable Care Act,"" Koskinen said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner. ""That does not remove the statutory mandate we have that we have to implement the Act.""To his credit, the House Appropriations Committee chairman wasn't buying it. ""The mandate we want you to have is to serve the public and you're not doing that,"" said Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican. He pointed out that Congress forked out the extra cash last year to ensure that the IRS improves customer service and cleans up its act after a string of scandals involving excessive bonuses, lavish conferences and the targeting of political dissidents.""Each year we learn that customer service diminishes,"" Rogers told Koskinen, who admitted the situation has been bad for ""three or four years.""""You may argue it's because the IRS budget has been cut, but I'm going to argue it's because the IRS chooses to spend its funds in other areas like the Affordable Care Act, bonuses and conferences,"" Rogers said.Koskinen faults Congress for not funding ObamaCare enforcement. So he let vital services to fall apart to make ObamaCare a priority.And now he wants a billion more.It's as if ObamaCare is black hole consuming the IRS, and not because of the law -- but because of the president's priorities and the decisions of his officials. It's its own reason to scrap ObamaCare and for the IRS to just say no.

236,HAL,"Crude oil's price collapse of more than 70% since June 2014 is messing with Texas in a big way, as the latest data continue to show that plunging oil prices are battering the state's energy-focused manufacturing sector.The Dallas Federal Reserve's general business activity index fell to -34.6 in January, much worse than December's revised -21.6. The brutal score is the most negative since April 2009 during the last recession.The production index, which had been holding up in positive territory despite weak orders numbers, finally plunged into negative territory, falling nearly 23 points to -10.2. New orders and unfilled orders fell deeper into contraction. The employment index turned negative after positive readings in the prior two months.Texas is not only a big oil production state, it's home to many energy giants and hundreds of thousands of industry jobs. Exxon Mobil (XOM) is based in Dallas-area Irving. ConocoPhillips (COP) calls Houston home, along with oil service giants Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI).On Monday, Halliburton reported a sharp drop in Q4 earnings , though it stated reports of the death of U.S. shale oil companies are premature. Last week, Schlumberger said its Q4 EPS fell 57% and its quarterly revenue tumbled 39%. Baker Hughes, which Halliburton is trying to buy, reports Thursday morning. All three companies have slashed tens of thousands of jobs over the past year.Halliburton shares fell 3% on the stock market today. Schlumberger lost 2.9%, and Baker Hughes fell 6.8%. Exxon Mobil retreated 3.4%, and ConocoPhillips gave up 9.2%.Crude oil futures fell sharply after surging late last week. U.S. futures fell 5.8% to $30.34 a barrel, with prices falling back below $30 in late trading.A strong dollar, weak global economic performance and a historic collapse in oil prices have battered manufacturers across the country. The Empire State manufacturing index sank to recession-era lows in this month's report. The Philadelphia Fed's January index was in negative territory for the fifth straight month. The Richmond Fed issues its report Tuesday, followed by the Kansas City Fed's report on Thursday.

237,HAL,"The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell for the 14th time in 15 weeks, as top shale firms hold off on completing wells.Baker Hughes (BHI) said Friday that the rig count fell by 13 to 400 in the past week, the lowest level since December 2009 and down from a peak of 1,609 in October 2014.The number of natural gas rigs ticked up to 102 from 101, despite prices hitting a 17-year low during the week.Crude prices rallied for most of Friday as pipeline issues in Iraq and Nigeria are expected to keep 800,000 barrels temporarily off the market. But they reversed lower, with Brent futures closing down 0.5% at $35.10 a barrel and U.S. oil down 0.9% at $32.78.The oil bust and the collapse in drilling activity have hit oilfield service providers especially hard, with the pain continuing as prices stay lower for longer.On Thursday, Halliburton (HAL) said it would cut its workforce by another 8%, roughly 5,000 jobs. Since 2014, the company has slashed 22,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce. Halliburton also has been divesting assets to get European regulators to approve its acquisition of Baker Hughes.Rival Schlumberger (SLB) has laid off 34,000 workers, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014, including 10,000 cuts in in the past quarter.Baker Hughes shares closed up 2.3% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 0.95%. Schlumberger edged up 0.2%.The new round of  layoffs come as U.S. shale drillers stop completion activities in the massive Bakken shale formation.Late Wednesday, Continental Resources (CLR) said it stopped fracking operations in the Bakken. It already had planned to defer most completions in the North Dakota play in 2016.It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken, with plans to maintain that level through the year, but said it has no stimulation crews deployed there.Also late Wednesday, Whiting Petroleum (WLL) said it will stop completing wells and cut its 2016 capital spending budget by 80% from 2015 to $500 million.Shale companies hope that by leaving wells drilled but not completed, they can bring back production quickly once oil prices rise. Fracking a well normally accounts for two-thirds of a well’s total production costs.While oil companies are trying to save money by operating fewer rigs and slashing budgets, their debt ratings are in jeopardy as lower revenue and investment will likely hurt companies for the next four years.Late Thursday, Moody's put Chevron (CVX) on review for a downgrade on expected negative free cash flow and changed Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) debt rating outlook to negative, as lower capital reinvestment will likely haunt the oil major for the rest of the decade.The ratings agency also downgraded ConocoPhillips’ (COP), Marathon Oil’s (MRO), Devon Energy’s (DVN) and Apache’s (APA) senior unsecured ratings with a negative outlooks late Thursday. It also cut ratings on EOG Resources (EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY), but sees a stable outlook.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
238,HAL,"Drilling activity has crashed, but efficiencies and American ingenuity have helped make each well far more productive.The number of oil rigs fell by 26 last week to 413, the lowest since December 2009, Baker Hughes (BHI) reported Friday. That's down 19% over the last four weeks and 59.5% vs. a year earlier.But U.S. oil output, though off peak levels, has held up remarkably well. That's in large part because Continental Resources (CLR), Concho Resources (CXO) and other shale producers are becoming, well, more productive with every well. They focused on the best wells, kept the best crews, while employing new technical advances and practices. They've also been able to squeeze suppliers and services firms such as Baker Hughes, Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL).• Bakken Shale new wells should produce 737 barrels per day in March, up from 558 bpd in March 2015. That's a 32% increase -- 88.5% vs. March 2014.• Eagle Ford new wells are expected to generate 812 barrels per day in March, up from 665 bpd a year earlier. That's a 22% jump.• Niobrara new wells should produce 741 barrels per day, up 39% from 533 bpd in March 2015.• Permian Basin new wells should produce a 423 barrels per day, a 49% spike from 284 bpd a year earlier.• Utica new wells should generate 309 barrels per day, a whopping 83% increase from 168 bpd in March 2015.Continental Resources, Concho Resources and other shale firms have been able to concentrate efforts, slashing capital spending and operating costs without a big blow to production. But with oil down to $30 a barrel or lower, these companies are under heavy  strain. Continental and Concho earnings reports are due this week, with the former expected to post a loss and the latter a 96% EPS dive.As for suppliers such as Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, they've cut tens of thousands of jobs.  But those oil services giants should emerge stronger after the oil bust, D.A. Davidson said in research reports last week.Schlumberger stock rose 3.6% last week, Baker Hughes 5.6% and Halliburton 7.8%. (Halliburton is trying to buy Baker Hughes, but faces skeptical antitrust officials.) On Monday, Schlumberger rose 2.1% in the stock market today. Halliburton rose 4.75% and Baker Hughes 3.2%.Meanwhile, Concho Resources advanced 5.9% last week but Continental Resources dived 9.7%. On Monday, Concho climbed 2.9% while Continental spiked 7.1%.

239,HAL,"Oilfield-services giants Halliburton (HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI), Schlumberger (SLB) and Weatherford International (WFT) stand to come out of the oil bust even stronger, D.A. Davidson said, citing their diversification, acquisitions and spending restraint.The bullish forecast, appearing in several research notes dated Thursday, follows more than a year of cuts to industry spending plans and tens of thousands of layoffs -- including at those companies -- amid collapsing crude prices.Low prices have devastated drilling activity, a mainstay for oilfield-services providers. The U.S. oil rig count also fell by 26 to 413 this week, Baker Hughes said Friday, down from a peak of 1,609 in October 2014.But D.A. Davidson expects ""significant improvement"" in the companies' financial performance next year as commodity prices and spending levels recover.""Diversified service companies are the best positioned to weather the current commodity cycle and come out stronger on the other side,"" analyst Sonny Randhawa said in initiating coverage of all four stocks with a buy rating.The firm added: ""We believe diversified service companies are well positioned in this cycle and would 'embrace the volatility' and use short-term dips in crude prices as opportunities to increase exposure, becoming more aggressive with the severity of the pullback.""Halliburton's proposed merger with Baker Hughes would create a company that would be a ""formidable international competitor for large scale integrated projects"" that would give Schlumberger a run for its money, Randhawa said.Randhawa still thinks a merger is likely despite regulators' concerns about the combined company's potential size and threat to competition.Halliburton shares closed down 0.3% in the stock market today as oil prices fell. Baker Hughes added 0.35%, and Schlumberger gained 0.3%.As for Schlumberger, Randhawa said the company was set to ""disproportionately outperform in this environment due to its scale, global diversification, technology leadership and game-changing Cameron acquisition.""The purchase of Cameron, which makes products for the oil and gas business, would cut costs for customers and bring together ""downhole and surface technology across the drilling and production life cycle,"" Randhawa said.And Weatherford, he said, has ""emerged as a more focused entity"" after two years of cutting costs and selling off assets.Weatherford, which also provides mechanical products and technological services to the oil and gas drilling industry, gapped down 4.8% Friday.D.A. Davidson expects capex cuts in the U.S. to slow down, easing from a 50% decrease last year to a 40% decline this year.

241,HAL,"The U.S. economy added a stronger-than-expected 242,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said. The jobless rate held steady at 4.9% even as people stream into the work force at the fastest pace in 16 years.The robust job creation, along with an upward revision of January's gain to 172,000, eased concerns that the financial market rout to start the year had dealt a blow to the economy.Market indexes drifted lower on the jobs report, but still pointed to a modest uptick at the open. Investors may fear that the Federal Reserve will be slightly more likely to raise interest rates again amid stronger economic data. But few economists expect policymakers to act at this month's FOMC meeting.The only real weak parts of the report came in hours worked and wages. Average hourly earnings fell 3 cents and are now up a tame 2.2% from a year ago, down from 2.5% in January and 2.6% in December. Cheaper gasoline prices are keeping inflation-adjusted wage gains strong. But the average workweek was shorter by 0.2 hours, falling to 34.4 hours.Meanwhile, the labor force rose 555,000, the latest in a string of healthy gains and the biggest since January 2015. But the 3-month average was the strongest since March 2000, at the very peak of the dot-com boom. That suggests that a healthier jobs market is finally pulling people into the work force, but also points to continued slack.The labor force participation rate rose 0.2 point to 62.9%, continuing to move off long-time lows but still well below pre-recession levels.Services firms added 257,000 accounting for more than 100% of net payroll gains.Mining and manufacturing sectors shed jobs amid energy sector woes and global headwinds. Halliburton (HAL) recently announced plans to cut another 5,000 jobs, as the oil industry slashes activity with prices so low.  
"
242,HAL,"The proposal from top oil producers Tuesday wasn't the output cut the market had hoped for, but the deal could still represent a starting point for discussions on eventual cuts.At a meeting in Doha, Qatar, oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela agreed to freeze production at January levels, but only if other major producers join. Iran said it has no intention to join them.Analysts also noted that too much oil was already on the market in January, suggesting the glut would continue. Markets dismissed the pact too, with U.S. crude futures falling 1.4% to $29.04 a barrel, and Brent dropping 3.6% to $32.18.Oil ministers from Venezuela, Iraq and Iran will meet in Tehran on Wednesday to discuss an agreement. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, is hopeful, pointing out that the top oil producers are willing to talk, unlike a few weeks ago.""Whether this first step of a million miles leads to a strong decline (in production) down the road has yet to be seen, but it's a step in the right direction,"" he told IBD.While Tuesday's agreement doesn't include a reduction in output, the proposed freeze at January levels could still serve as a ceiling, which has been missing from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries amid sharp internal divisions.In December, OPEC failed to agree on a ceiling for the first time in recent memory after members kept producing over their limits for more than a year. The lack of a ceiling has allowed individual producers to do what they wanted.""So this isn't a production cut,"" Flynn said. ""It gives us a starting point for a production cut.""Iran could be one of the major stumbling blocks to a production cut, as Tehran seems unlikely to agree to any deal unless it is allowed to keep increasing output to levels seen before the West imposed economic sanctions.Over the weekend, state-run Iranian media said the country had sent its first shipment of crude to Europe in five years, adding that Tehran has already reached deals to export oil to France, Russia and Spain.But Iran needs money flowing in if it wants to boost production, and Tehran won't get that if oil prices continue to fall, Flynn noted. So Iran still has an incentive to hope the other major players can come together for a production cut.Meanwhile, U.S. producers have been trimming output since prices sank. Total domestic crude output hit 9.61 million barrels a day in June, but it has since dipped below 9.2 million. Earlier this month, the Energy Information Administration said it sees 2016 production averaging 8.7 million barrels a day.Low prices are also stressing producers' finances. Dozens of companies in the U.S. filed for bankruptcy protection last year, and the pace is expected to pick up this year.On Tuesday, Deloitte said a third of oil producers worldwide could go bankrupt as low oil prices dry up liquidity. The report looked at 500 companies in the oil and gas sector.The report came a week after Chesapeake Energy (CHK), amid reports it may look at restructuring, said it doesn’t have plans right now to file for bankruptcy protection.Earlier this month, oil and gas producer Linn Energy (LINE) and affiliate LinnCo (LNCO) said they would “explore strategic alternatives” but added that they have enough resources to continue operations.The Deloitte report also found that producers are filing more bankruptcies than oilfield service providers, most likely due to larger capital costs for producers. Eventually, service providers will start feeling the squeeze too -- giants like Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs.

243,HAL,"Initial jobless claims fell by 5,000 last week to 267,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average rose by 1,750 to 272,500, a three-month high.But by either measure, unemployment filings have held below 300,000 for almost the entire year, hitting a long-term low in July. Sub-300,000 readings normally signal booming job gains, but not in this economic cycle.Net job growth has been mediocre. Yes, there have been layoffs. Hewlett-Packard, now split into HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), announced plans to cut 30,000 workers. Oil services firms Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have announced tens of thousands of job cuts as demand plunges with the price of crude.But jobless claims and layoffs aren't the culprit. The problem is that actual gross hiring — hiring before any job cuts or exits — still hasn't returned to pre-recession levels, according to Labor's JOLTS report. Truth be told, gross hiring wasn't booming in the prior 2001-2007 expansion either, so failing to live up even to that pace isn't encouraging.Weak gross hiring likely is one reason why the labor force participation rate, including among prime-age workers, remains so low. Weak hiring — and firing — also suggest a less-dynamic economy.

249,HAL,"The lifting of sanctions against Iran could be a double-edged sword for Schlumberger (SLB) as it gets ready to report fourth-quarter results Friday amid a round of layoffs and oil prices that have plunged to below $30 a barrel.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the oilfield service provider to report a 58% drop in quarterly earnings to 63 cents per share. Revenue is seen falling 38.2% to $7.8 billion.In December, Schlumberger said it would cut more jobs in the fourth quarter ""in light of expected reduced activity for 2016."" Industry peers Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs due to weak demand for their services as U.S rig counts fall as low crude prices make many projects unprofitable. Halliburton has a deal to buy Baker Hughes, which regulators have yet to approve.Halliburton is scheduled to announce quarterly results Monday.On Saturday the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog confirmed that Iran has curbed its nuclear program, allowing Western sanctions to be lifted and unfreezing $100 billion in assets. Oilfield-service companies may get a boost if their equipment can be used for drilling. But the return of Iranian crude on the world market will push oil prices even lower as Saudi-lead OPEC is unlikely to scale back production to make room for Iran's additional output.

250,HAL,"Schlumberger (SLB) earnings beat estimates late Thursday, and the oil-field service provider announced a $10 billion repurchase program.Fourth-quarter earnings plunged 57% to 65 cents per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 63 cents. Revenue fell 39% to $7.7 billion, under views for $7.8 billion. North American revenue sank 55% to $1.95 billion, and international revenue fell 30% to $5.7 billion.The company forecast 2016 capital expenditures of $2.4 billion, even with 2015 spending.Shares climbed 1.3% in after-hours trading in the stock market today.During Q4, Schlumberger said that it had cut its workforce by 10,000 more employees as it looked to reduce overhead and infrastructure expenses. The company announced some job cuts in December ""in light of expected reduced activity for 2016"" but didn't give a number.Industry peers Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have already slashed tens of thousands of jobs due to weak demand for their services as oil prices and U.S rig counts have fallen.Shares of Halliburton and Baker Hughes were unchanged in evening trading. Halliburton, which has a deal to buy Baker Hughes, is scheduled to announce quarterly results Monday.In addition to the $10 billion buyback, Schlumberger said that it will continue to issue its quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share. Despite oil prices staying lower for longer, oil majors like Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) have vowed to keep their dividends.Also Thursday, the Energy Information Administration said that crude oil inventories for the week ended Jan. 15 rose by 4 million barrels, more than analysts expected.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

308,HAL,"In December, Magnum Hunter Resources filed for bankruptcy protection, and dozens of smaller producers have filed in 2015, with the pace likely to pick up this year.""Banks are going to clamp down and are not going to be as generous as in 2015,"" said Dan Guffey, VP of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus.The prospect of less financing from banks comes as energy companies rely less on the bond and equity markets to raise liquidity. And over-leveraged firms in particular will feel the squeeze, as oil is expected to stay lower for longer.In 2015, Brent crude hit an 11-year low, and U.S. prices fell to levels not seen since 2009. Even lower prices may be ahead.How Low Will Oil Go?JPMorgan analysts see oil staying lower for the first half of 2016 before rising in the second. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have said oil could even hit $20 a barrel. Guffey forecasts oil at $35 to $45 per gallon.Tensions in the Middle East are increasing, potentially boosting oil prices. But the rapidly escalating rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia may sink any hopes that Saudi-led OPEC will make room for Iran's additional output and ease the global oil glut.U.S. producers were able to weather the low-price environment in 2015 by slashing costs, payrolls, drilling rigs and capital expenditure budgets. They also used new techniques on their most efficient, productive wells, keeping U.S. output more resilient than expected.But hunkering down for another year may prove difficult. Gains from drilling innovations, such as using higher sand concentrations and higher proppant volumes, are expected to slow this year, and costs have less room to drop.""We might be in the later innings of those efficiency gains as operators don't want to test in the lower oil price environment,"" Guffey said.U.S. Production To TumbleAfter a modest dip, oil production should see a steeper drop this year. The Energy Information Administration expects U.S. crude output to fall to an average of 8.76 million barrels a day in 2016 from 9.33 million barrels a day in 2015.Meanwhile, more budget cuts are on the horizon this year as well. Chevron (CVX) has said it plans to spend $26.6 billion in 2016, 24% less than in 2015. ConocoPhillips (COP) has said capital expenditures will fall to $7.7 billion in 2016, down 25% from 2015 and 55% from 2014.The big, integrated oil majors are also reluctant to pay for companies or oilfields that aren't top quality, and stable U.S. shale producers are hesitant to spend cash on assets that might not be drilled for years from struggling small firms.So the wave of industry consolidation that was expected when oil prices initially sank hasn't happened yet, though Noble Energy's (NBL) $2 billion purchase of Rosetta Resources and Royal Dutch Shell's (RDSA) $70 billion deal for BG Group were among the few that stood out in 2015. But private equity firms could be interested in smaller oil companies, Guffey said.A mega-merger in oilfield services may be clinched in early 2016. While regulators have been skeptical of Halliburton 's (HAL) $35 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI), discussions with the Justice Department continue, and the companies extended their deadline to April.Amid the gloom of U.S. oil prices at recession-era lows, producers were able to score at least one victory in 2015: ending the ban on exports of U.S. crude.The first crude shipment left Texas on Dec. 31, on its way for the Vitol Group, a Dutch oil-trading firm, according to ConocoPhillips and NuStar Energy (NS).That comes ahead of Iran's expected return to world oil markets, as economic sanctions over its nuclear program could be lifted this month. Tehran has said it can double oil production to 1 million barrels per day in 2016.Hopes are high that opening up export markets for U.S. shale firms will prop up drilling activity and bring back some jobs. Lawmakers also see it as a political weapon.Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, is already paying the price for cheap prices and sees a $98 billion budget deficit for 2015 and $86.86 billion in 2016, as it derives 90% of its fiscal revenue from oil. Saudi Arabia will now face more U.S. competition.""Having the oil export ban lifted permanently is like having 100 Keystone pipelines, and it's really good for foreign policy. . .. It helps us put OPEC out of business,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan said during a Dec. 21 interview on ""The Hugh Hewitt Show."" ""It's not good for Venezuela, the Middle East, Russia and others.""

It was for 10 films over 10 years, a vote of confidence for the 27-year-old star of British theater, who had made only a few motion pictures.But ""My Cousin Rachel"" and ""The Robe"" had earned him Academy Award nominations, so mogul Darryl Zanuck guaranteed that he'd be paid, even if no movies were made.Burton turned him down.""He had worked out that in the prior 12 months, the $300,000 he had earned would be watered down to $42,000, once he factored in his agent's fee and high British taxes,"" Tom Rubython, author of ""And God Created Burton,"" told IBD. ""He decided to return to his first passion, playing Shakespeare at the Old Vic in London, for $6,000 for 39 weeks.""Coaxed back to Hollywood the next year, he made a wide variety of films, from the historic spectacle ""Cleopatra"" to the critically acclaimed ""The Night of the Iguana.""By 1969, he was the world's highest-paid actor, commanding $1.25 million (equivalent to $8 million now), plus a percentage of the gross, for ""Staircase.""Big FamilyBurton (1925-84) was born Richard Jenkins in Pontrhydyfen, Wales, the 12th of 13 children.His father was a coal miner who went on drinking and gambling sprees, leaving the family poor. Before Richard was 2, his mother died at 44 in childbirth.He went to live with his sister Cecilia and her husband in Port Talbot in the south of Wales for the next 15 years.""My sister had become even more mother to me than any mother could ever have been,"" he said of her positive influence.The other great impact came from his tough schoolmaster, Meredith Jones, who instilled in him a love of learning.As a teen, Richard began acting in plays. He did odd jobs, from hauling horse manure to running messages, then dropped out of school at 15 to earn more money at a men's clothing and hat shop.Jones convinced the school to take him back 18 months later and asked one of the teachers, Philip Burton, to mentor him.Seeing the potential in the boy, he became Richard's legal ward, fed and clothed him and gave him his name.He began training Richard to act, to the point of sending him to the tops of mountains to learn how to project his voice.""Philip Burton was a creative genius, and if there was ever a case that superstars can be manufactured out of raw material, it was his transformation of Richard,"" said Rubython.At 18, Burton entered a six-month program at the University of Oxford for Royal Air Force cadets. He developed the habit of carrying a bag of books, including volumes of Shakespeare, history, biography and crossword puzzles.He would return three decades later to teach a course on poetry.And in 1964, he competed with a fellow fan of the Bard, U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, in reciting the sonnets; Burton won by quoting the 15th backward.In 1944, Burton joined the RAF, but the war ended before he finished training as a navigator.After his discharge in 1947, he made his first film, ""The Last Days of Dolwyn,"" set in a Welsh village about to be covered in water from a new reservoir, and was praised by one reviewer for his ""acting fire.""He met his first wife, actress Sybil Williams, on the set. They married two years later and would have two daughters.He had small parts in several more films that had critics talking about his potential to be a leading man, while his stock rose on stage. He earned $4,000 (equal to 10 times that now) for 10 days' work in 1950.The next year saw him at Stratford-on-Avon as Prince Hal in Shakespeare's ""Henry IV, Part I.""""Like his friends Laurence Olivier and Peter O'Toole, Burton was a unique and utterly electrifying stage actor who commanded the rapt attention of his audience,"" noted IMDB.com.Word reached Hollywood in 1952. His first picture there was ""My Cousin Rachel"" opposite Olivia de Havilland, for which he received his first Oscar nomination. Six more followed; he would never win the award, though sometimes critics said he should have. He followed up with 1953's ""Desert Rats,"" set during the North African campaign against the Nazis.Then came a blockbuster, ""The Robe,"" for which he earned another Oscar nomination as a Roman soldier who helps crucify Christ and converts to the new religion.After rejecting Zanuck's 10-picture deal and returning to London, the Old Vic season propelled him to the top rank of Shakespearean actors, with comparisons made to Olivier and John Gielgud.But the death of his friend, the Welsh poet and playwright Dylan Thomas, from alcoholism at age 39 deeply saddened Burton.Burton and other actors donated their fees for a radio production of Thomas' last play, ""Under Milk Wood,"" to benefit Thomas' family. The thespian would reprise his role in the 1972 film version.Going The DistanceCommuting between Hollywood and London, he spent the next decade racking up mostly forgettable film fare, for which he was paid well.In 1957, he made $287,000 (equal to $2.4 million now) but was left with just $21,000 after British taxes, says RichardBurton.com.He and Sybil decided to lower their bill by moving to Celigny, Switzerland.In 1958, Burton was nominated for a Tony Award for his part in ""Time Remembered"" on Broadway, then won the honor as King Arthur in 1960's ""Camelot.""He would also be nominated in 1964 for starring in ""Hamlet"" in the longest-running version of the play in Broadway history at 136 performances.All the while, movies called.In 1963, Burton was cast as Mark Antony in ""Cleopatra."" At a cost of $40 million (equal to $300 million now), it was the most expensive movie up to that time and took a long time to get into the black.The Egyptian queen was played by Elizabeth Taylor, and Burton's affair with her led to divorce from Sybil and marriage to the dark-haired beauty the next year.Burton and Taylor would divorce in 1974, remarry the next year and divorce again in 1976.As the archbishop martyred by King Henry II in 1964's ""Becket,"" Burton received an Oscar nomination for his intense and restrained performance opposite O'Toole.The same year, he starred in the film version of Tennessee Williams' ""The Night of the Iguana,"" which was a box office smash that many critics still regard as his finest acting.HonoredOther 1960s hits that won him Britain's equivalent of the Academy Award and that were nominated for Oscars were ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" and ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""Burton set his minimum fee at $1 million and a percentage of the gross with ""Where Eagles Dare,"" a World War II blockbuster that ended up earning him $8 million — worth $54 million today.But other movies were commercial disappointments, including ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" (though Burton was nominated for an Oscar) and ""Staircase"" (for which he earned a $1.25 million fee but little from ticket sales).The 1970s were less successful for Burton on the screen, because he accepted anything that paid big bucks in order to pay alimony. Still, he had two triumphs.He starred in ""Equus"" on Broadway in 1976 and for his body of stage work was given a special Tony. The film version the next year earned him a Golden Globe and his seventh Oscar nomination. ""The Wild Geese,"" a 1978 adventure about mercenaries in Africa, was an international box office hit.In 1976, he also received the Grammy Award for the Best Album for Children, along with Jonathan Winters and Billy Simpson, for the recording of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's novel ""The Little Prince.""Burton married model Suzy Miller in 1976, and they divorced in 1982. The next year he married film production assistant Sally Hay.His last movie role came in 1984 in the critically acclaimed depiction of George Orwell's novel ""Nineteen Eighty Four."" Burton shot it despite being nearly incapacitated by neck and back pain.He also finished a CBS miniseries, ""Ellis Island,"" and was planning to star in the sequel to ""The Wild Geese.""But his health had been declining because of smoking since he was 8 and heavy drinking starting at 12.He died later that year of a brain hemorrhage at 58 and was buried at Celigny. His lifetime movie earnings totaled $75 million — worth $530 million in today's money.

391,HAL,"Ok...so what happened last night? All that hype about the China macro data kept everyone on edge over the weekend...what would they report? Would it be a disaster? What would that say about the health of the Chinese economy and then by default the global economy? In the end - it was NOT a blockbuster, in fact it was rather boring really....
"
392,HAL,"At 10:00 pm est - China released a bunch of data - and it was mixed.....no disasters but no upside surprises either.........3rd Qtr GDP came in above expectations at 6.9% (exp was for 6.8%), Industrial Production did rise 5.7%, but that was below the exp of 6%. Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean? Well - to start with - the data implies that the world is not ending and that the Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing - which in the end is a positive.
"
393,HAL,"Angus Nicholson - Market Analyst at IG sums it up like this:
"
394,HAL,"""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Nonetheless, markets have clearly been buoyed by the better than expected headline number, and it shows that China's economy has not deteriorated as much as some had thought""
"
395,HAL,"James Laurenceson - Deputy Director of the Australia-China Relations Institute added that:
"
396,HAL,"""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""
"
397,HAL,"So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.
"
398,HAL,"Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.
"
399,HAL,"European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.
"
400,HAL,"France's Danone Group up 2.5% beat estimates, Germany's Deutsche Bank +3.1%, announces a big management shakeup and restructuring plan - heads to roll and that is helping to send other financials higher. German retailer Metro - announces a rise in sales and is talking all bullish about the coming Christmas season sending this stock up by 3.7%. Air France- KLM announces job CUTS in 2016 and investors love it - sending that stock higher.... and not to be left in the dark - Italian carmaker Ferrari is getting ready to price its IPO tomorrow and will start trading on the NYSE on Thursday.
"
401,HAL,"This morning US futures are off 1 pt.....Now prior to the China report - US futures were pointing lower on the expectation that we were gonna get hit hard....and when that did not happen - Futures moved to the plus side and are now flat. I suspect that the market will test resistance at 2040 and then back off trying to find support in the 2025 range - if not, then definitely the 1980 range.
"
402,HAL,"As much as there is plenty of US macro data this week - the focus will now return to US corp earnings. This week and next week will see hundreds of reports for investors to chew on. Earnings to include: HAS, MS, HAL, GPC, IBM, ZION, AXP, BA, KO, MCD, MSFT, and PG to name just a few.
"
403,HAL,"NOTE: Fed's Lacker is due to speak today at 12 pm.
"
404,HAL,"Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.
"
405,HAL,"Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?
"
406,HAL,"Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....
"
407,HAL,"The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?

"
418,HAL,"Oil production outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is seen falling by the most in 24 years, while the oversupply in world markets now appears worse than thought, making it possible for prices to hit $20 a barrel.
"
419,HAL,"On Friday, the International Energy Agency said OPEC output will rise, but non-OPEC output will drop by nearly 500,000 barrels a day next year, with production in Russia and the North Sea sinking to the lowest levels since the fall of the Soviet Union.
"
420,HAL,"The latest slump in oil prices also ""could stop U.S. growth in its tracks"" and has ""dimmed the prospects for a recovery in U.S. drilling activity,"" the IEA added in a report.
"
421,HAL,"The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation fell in the latest week by 10 to 652, Baker Hughes (BHI) said, marking a second straight drop after a brief rally that tracked a short-lived recovery in oil prices.
"
422,HAL,"U.S. Drivers Add To Demand
"
423,HAL,"Meanwhile, the IEA said low prices are lifting world demand that OPEC's low-cost producers should meet via increased production. Indeed, the energy watchdog said U.S. motorists are sending domestic gasoline demand to an eight-year high.
"
424,HAL,"That should give OPEC even more incentive to keep production high. The cartel shocked energy markets last November when it refused to trim production targets amid robust U.S. output. Crude collapsed, and OPEC members like Saudi Arabia pumped at record levels to force cuts from U.S. shale firms and protect market share.
"
425,HAL,"No Relief From Saudis
"
426,HAL,"Saudi Arabia hasn't backed down and on Friday said it doesn't support holding an emergency OPEC meeting to prop up prices, sources told Reuters. Venezuela had asked for a meeting as the country struggles to generate revenue amid cheap oil.
"
427,HAL,"U.S. crude futures settled down 2.8% to $44.63 per barrel, and Brent crude ended down 1.5% to $48.14. Oil's slide could get worse, according to a Goldman Sachs report Friday.
"
428,HAL,"Analysts there said the market was even more oversupplied than previously estimated, adding that because production takes months to slow down after rigs are removed, Brent oil could fall as low as $20 per barrel. But Goldman sees $20 oil as only ""transient"" and would help ""immediately rebalance"" supply and demand.
"
429,HAL,"Goldman sees U.S. crude averaging $45 per barrel next year, down from its earlier estimate of $57. It now sees Brent down to $49.50 per barrel in 2016 vs. a prior view for $62 as Iran ramps up production following the removal of economic sanctions.
"
430,HAL,"U.S. firms, which have emerged as swing producers relied upon to put markets back in balance, are cutting back. The Energy Department said last month that production in June was 9.3 million barrels per day, down from 9.4 million in May and a peak of 9.6 million in April. Last week, output hit 9.14 million barrels per day.
"
431,HAL,"Negative Cash Flow?
"
432,HAL,"Shale producers like Continental Resources (CLR) have also slashed costs to survive in the lower-price environment.
"
433,HAL,"Continental said last month that its second-quarter drilling and completion costs for most operated wells declined 20% since the end of 2014, due primarily to lower service costs, and expects another 5%-10% in reductions by the end of the year on additional cost cuts and efficiency gains.
"
434,HAL,"But the cuts might not be enough. Continental CEO Harold Hamm has said that if U.S. crude prices are at $60 a barrel, cash flow would be neutral. But below $50, the company would be outspreading its cash inflow. Continental Resources shares closed down 3.6% on Friday. EOG Resources (EOG), another shale firm, dropped 1.2%.Oil production outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is seen falling by the most in 24 years, while the oversupply in world markets now appears worse than thought, making it possible for prices to hit $20 a barrel.On Friday, the International Energy Agency said OPEC output will rise, but non-OPEC output will drop by nearly 500,000 barrels a day next year, with production in Russia and the North Sea sinking to the lowest levels since the fall of the Soviet Union.The latest slump in oil prices also ""could stop U.S. growth in its tracks"" and has ""dimmed the prospects for a recovery in U.S. drilling activity,"" the IEA added in a report.The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation fell in the latest week by 10 to 652, Baker Hughes (BHI) said, marking a second straight drop after a brief rally that tracked a short-lived recovery in oil prices.U.S. Drivers Add To DemandMeanwhile, the IEA said low prices are lifting world demand that OPEC's low-cost producers should meet via increased production.

Last week, output hit 9.14 million barrels per day.Negative Cash Flow?Shale producers like Continental Resources (CLR) have also slashed costs to survive in the lower-price environment.Continental said last month that its second-quarter drilling and completion costs for most operated wells declined 20% since the end of 2014, due primarily to lower service costs, and expects another 5%-10% in reductions by the end of the year on additional cost cuts and efficiency gains.But the cuts might not be enough. Continental CEO Harold Hamm has said that if U.S. crude prices are at $60 a barrel, cash flow would be neutral. But below $50, the company would be outspreading its cash inflow. Continental Resources shares closed down 3.6% on Friday. EOG Resources (EOG), another shale firm, dropped 1.2%.

Drilling activity has been falling sharply since late 2014, as plunging oil prices turned profitable operations in loss-making ones. Despite the sharp drop in oil rigs, U.S. shale production has fallen less than expected due to technical advances. And the global supply glut continues.It all means less demand for oil services firms such as Baker Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger (SLB). Halliburton, which has a deal to buy Baker Hughes that antitrust regulators haven't signed off on yet, fell 2.2% on Friday. Baker Hughes actually rose 1.3%, while Schlumberger sank 2.7%.U.S. crude oil prices fell 22 cents to $34.73 a barrel on Friday.Compounding the problem: The number of natural gas rigs fell by 17 to 168, hitting a fresh long-time low.

In July, Linn Energy (LINE) and its affiliate LinnCo. (LNCO) said they would stop making dividend-like payments to shareholders to free up money for debt payments.The number of oil rigs in operation have also started to come back down, after a brief rebound that tracked a temporary bump in oil prices over the spring.On Friday, Baker Hughes (BHI) said the U.S. oil rig count fell by 8 in the latest week to 644, the third straight decline, and is down by 957 rigs vs. a year ago.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

525,HAL,"California's gas-price spike appears to be having a negative impact on already-shaky consumer sentiment nationwide. The latest IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index fell 1.2 points to 46.9, the lowest since November, led by a 15.4% drop in the West. California's reading was 45.2. Readings below 50 signal pessimism.Nationwide, the six-month outlook gauge fell 1.8 points to 42.7, marking the fourth straight drop and the lowest in a year. The personal financial outlook index rose, back near recent highs.But in the West, this gauge was 52.3, the lowest since October 2013. In California, it was 49.5.Meanwhile, wages overall have been flat or barely improving, and revised figures last week show that the current economic expansion is the worst recovery since World War II.So it's not surprising that 42% say the U.S. is still in a recession, up from 38% in May, according to the IBD/TIPP Poll. Just 47% say the economy is improving, including 45% in the West.In contrast with the sudden collapse in Western attitudes, sentiment in the South climbed 2.3 points to 49.5. The Northeast's dipped 0.5 point to 48.8, and the Midwest's fell 1.3 points to 44.3.California Refinery WoesThe high gas prices that are causing the West's mood swing can be traced back to the late 1990s, when California lawmakers began setting unique standards for cleaner-burning gasoline. The state has since stacked on several other environmental rules that raise the cost for California refineries, which tend to run near 100% of capacity. Few refiners outside the state produce this special blend.This year, California has been plagued by refinery issues. Tesoro (TSO) recently cut capacity at its L.A.-area Carson plant for maintenance. In February, Tesoro idled its Northern California site in Martinez for weeks due to a nationwide union walkout.Also in February, Exxon Mobil (XOM) slashed operations at its Torrance refinery after an explosion damaged an air pollution monitoring unit. The Exxon Torrance site is running far below normal capacity and may not be fully back until year-end.In most states, refinery problems don't have a big impact on gas prices, because other plants make up the slack. In California, that's not an option. It can take weeks for tankers to cross the oceans with fuel that meets California's standards.Bad For Poor, Good For TeslaThat's pushed up gas prices throughout Southern California. Over the past four weeks, L.A. drivers have paid 51% more than the nation overall, easily the greatest difference on record.U.S. regular gasoline prices fell nearly 6 cents to $2.69 a gallon in the week ended Aug. 3, the Energy Information Administration reported Monday. That's down 23.5% vs. a year earlier.But in L.A., prices are up from a year ago. The average price at the pump is $3.99, or an extra $1.30 over the U.S. average.Prices in San Francisco and other parts of Northern California are a little lower — around $3.50 a gallon — but still well above the U.S. average.High gas prices are regressive, hitting the poor far more than coastal elites. California's poor, especially in the hot interior, also face soaring electricity prices due to the state's renewable mandates, pushing more households into ""energy poverty.""But high California gas prices are good news for alternative-fuel vehicle makers such as Tesla Motors (TSLA). The state accounts for nearly half of Tesla's Model S sales by some estimates.

583,HAL,"Robots Work As Wages Rise
"
584,HAL,"China's manufacturing wages are now higher than those of many other Asian countries, such as Vietnam, says a Boston Consulting Group study. China's manufacturing wages have climbed to $14.60 an hour and have been rising over 10% annually in coastal areas, though its working-age population has now peaked.

585,HAL,"Bank of America, in a November report, said that the global industrial robot market will grow from $10.7 billion in 2014 to $13.4 billion in 2018.
"
586,HAL,"Factory robots start at around $25,000 and run up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. China's local robot makers have been undercutting the prices of foreign suppliers to gain share. Chinese-made robots may lack the precision or reliability of foreign models but could cost half as much.
"
587,HAL,"Most industrial robots today do heavy lifting, welding and drilling, and apply coatings such as glue or paint. Advanced robots may perform pressing, printing, polishing and packaging.

"
595,HAL,"Moel says that Siasun is among Chinese robot makers hunting for acquisitions, but so far it hasn't bought smaller Japanese or European companies.
"
596,HAL,"Government support has spawned more than 200 Chinese robotics companies, with many tethered to state contracts. Moel says that the average operating profit of Chinese robot makers is a slim 8%. There could be a shakeout if China's economy keeps slowing, analysts say.
"
597,HAL,"Citigroup forecasts that China's domestic robotics companies will hold 33% of the market by 2018, up from 28% in 2014.
"
598,HAL,"Zhang says China's up-and-coming robot makers include Siasun, Shenzhen Inovance Technology, Effort Intelligent Equipment, GSK, Estun Robotics, Shanghai STEP Electric and systems integrator Bozhong Precision Industry Technology. Bernstein's Moel says that two local players to watch are HollySys (HOLI) and Delta Electronics.
"
599,HAL,"China's economy flourished as more and more rural farmers were put to work in factories. But producing sneakers, plastic toys and T-shirts will not maintain China's economic growth in the mid-single digits, says Moel. Automation could help China compete in aerospace, medical equipment and other industries.

600,HAL,"A Methodical March
"
601,HAL,"Today, Chinese firms are far from producing world-class robots. If China stays reliant on foreign-supplied robotics, its manufacturing competitiveness could suffer. Foreign suppliers' intellectual property concerns could pose a hurdle to China getting the latest and greatest outside technology.
"
602,HAL,"For now, Chinese customers prefer to buy from experienced robotics providers abroad because of their reliability, says Bernstein Research.
"
603,HAL,"Hal Sirkin, a Boston Consulting Group managing director, believes that China will catch up in robotics as it caught up in household appliances, Internet software and consumer electronics. But Sirkin does not expect China to become a force in robot exports any time soon.
"
604,HAL,"""They're going after high-end manufacturing,"" Sirkin said in an interview. ""Robotics is very sophisticated. They'll move methodically, walking their way up as they have every time. Learning more, getting better, learning more, getting better is how they do it. They won't skip steps in the chain.""
"
605,HAL,"""They'll be a force in robotics,"" Sirkin added. ""When that'll happen I don't know. To be world-class in five years is probably an impossibility.""For China's ""robolution"" to succeed, companies such as Apple iPhone supplier Foxconn Technology must make it happen. Both China and the Taiwan-headquartered Foxconn face big challenges in replacing human workers with robots.Why automate? As Apple (AAPL) makes effort to use more contract manufacturers, Foxconn needs robots to improve productivity and address concerns over harsh working conditions for its human employees.China, meanwhile, is losing its cheap manufacturing edge as the country's factory salaries rise. China's President Xi Jinping last year called for ""an industrial robot revolution.""""Foxconn is facing pressure from rising wages in the electronics sector,"" said Jan Zhang, a Beijing-based automation analyst at IHS. ""Many Chinese manufacturers need to increase productivity to stay competitive.""Foxconn Gears Up SlowlyFoxconn, which makes its own robots, has scaled back ambitious plans. It has yet to automate Apple iPhone assembly lines. It has some 50,000 installed robots, well shy of its earlier-stated 1 million goal.Foxconn aims to use industrial robots for 30% of the work at its Chinese factories for all customers by 2020.By 2025, meanwhile, China's government aims to move beyond labor-intensive work into high-end manufacturing. In automobiles, electronics and other sectors, robotics technology will be key to meet that goal.Southern province Guangdong, home of the Pearl River Delta manufacturing hub, says that it'll spend $152 billion to develop a home-grown robotics industry.China's automakers, the biggest robotics customers, buy robots mostly from foreign suppliers — ABB (ABB), Fanuc, Yaskawa Electric and Kuka — although one domestic company, Siasun Robot & Automation, has also made significant inroads.The Big Four hold about 60% of China's robotics market, says Zhang. It'll take time for China to develop its own robotics technology, she adds.""If you think about the mobile phone market, 10 years ago there was no local Chinese brand. It was all Nokia, Sony (SNE); there was no Apple at that time,"" Zhang said. ""Now you have companies like Xiaomi.""""Industrial robots could be more difficult, because there are sophisticated requirements — software, key components — that need to be put together.""Long Robot March LoomsChina says that it can develop its own domestic robotics industry, just as it made advances in semiconductors, telecommunications and other sectors. However, a big technology gap exists.China's domestic robot makers buy most of the components they use, such as servo motors, from foreign companies, pressuring profit margins.""There is still a long way to go for Chinese players to be truly competitive,"" said Alberto Moel, a Bernstein Research analyst, in a December report on China's robotics industry.""They lack the core technologies to manufacture key components of industrial robots and advanced automation systems. Currently, the markets they dominate are relatively low-end markets, such as linear robots, where they are gaining market share, mostly through aggressive pricing.""Although domestic players are actively seeking out M&A opportunities to gain technological capabilities, it will definitely take years for them to ... develop competitive products.""Local robot makers have the most market share in the chemical, metals and food and beverage industries, he said.China overtook Japan as the biggest buyer of robots in 2013. In 2014, China purchased 57,000 industrial robots, up 56% from a year earlier, one-fourth of the global total, says the International Federation of Robotics.Even so, China's robot-to-worker ratio is still far below the world average. China's robot density — installed robots per 10,000 employees — was 36 in 2014, in contrast to South Korea's 478, Japan's 314 and Germany's 292, says a Citigroup report. The U.S. has a robot penetration of 164.The Boston Consulting Group forecasts that by 2025, robots will perform 25% of manufacturing tasks, up from 10% currently. In some sectors — such as  computers and electronics, machinery and transportation equipment — the share could rise to 45%, BCG says.Analysts say that the payback time for investing in automation is getting shorter as wages rise.Robots Work As Wages RiseChina's manufacturing wages are now higher than those of many other Asian countries, such as Vietnam, says a Boston Consulting Group study.

644,HAL,"Sen. Marco Rubio, R.-Fla., a presidential candidate, is also a primary sponsor of I-Squared. In a July speech in Chicago, he emphasized the need for skill-based labor and the impact of globalization on the economy. His office declined to speak specifically about H-1B visas.
"
645,HAL,"Those who support increasing H-1B visas do so on the grounds of innovation, skills shortage and free market principles. Tech leaders claim that H-1B visas create more jobs in the U.S. for U.S. workers.

Everyone agrees, in both parties.""
"
647,HAL,"But many in Washington and elsewhere do not agree with increasing the number of H-1B visas. Many scholars and analysts have long argued that there is no U.S. worker shortage in the STEM fields and that employers use the H-1B visa program to pay lower wages.

"
655,HAL,"Research by Kirk Doran, an associate professor at the University of Notre Dame; Alexander Gelber, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley; and Adam Isen, an economist at the U.S. Department of Treasury; found that winning an additional H-1B visa does not improve innovation at a company, does have displacement effects, and does increase the firm's profit.
"
656,HAL,"Salzman, who has testified before Congress about the matter, has found that the U.S. supply of top graduates exceeds the hiring needs of STEM industries, wages in the IT industry have been stagnant for years, and the majority of guest workers fill entry-level positions.
"
657,HAL,"Congress has not taken action regarding H-1B visas, as discussions have stalled in the context of comprehensive immigration reform. While investigations into H-1B abuse are still underway, any arguments and legislation will have to address the potential for fraud.
"
658,HAL,"Salzman said it's a discussion of the U.S. workforce and the decision that U.S. employers make. ""It's not immigrant vs. native. It's about do I need a special category for guest workers or can I just hire through my normal hiring provision?,"" said Salzman. ""A large portion of IT are immigrants and those are getting the hardest hit.""Recent allegations of H-1B visa abuse have prompted heightened talks around skilled immigration, but the Department of Homeland Security might not be able to enforce H-1B laws on its own.At an oversight hearing in July on immigration enforcement, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson was asked about the potential consequences for companies that violated H-1B terms.""That's actually something where I think Congress may be able to help us,"" he said.

At the request of a bipartisan group of senators, the Department of Labor is investigating the matter.Disney has since reversed the decision to lay off its U.S. workers, but the controversy over H-1B visas has been reignited.The H-1B program provides 85,000 temporary visas a year to foreigners who work in specialty occupations, typically in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math. Employers argue that the program is necessary because they are unable to find the skills they need in the U.S. labor pool.Microsoft (MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates has testified before Congress, asking to raise the number of foreign workers allowed in the country.Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and a number of tech leaders are part of FWD.us, an organization that aims address immigration reform. Zuckerberg has also advocated for more H-1B visas for ""talented specialists"" in the opinion pages of the Washington Post.Sen. Hatch Aims To Boost H-1BSome members of Congress have listened to the pleas.Sen. Orrin Hatch's Immigrant Innovation Act, also known as I-Squared, proposes to increase the H-1B cap from 65,000 to 115,000 and allow the cap to go up to 195,000 if early fillings exceed the cap.""In today's global and technology-driven economy, business will go wherever human capital can be found. Be that Canada, Chile, China, or India. To strengthen America's economy, we must ensure that human capital can come here and stay here,"" said Sen. Hatch, R.-Utah, before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Sen. Marco Rubio, R.-Fla., a presidential candidate, is also a primary sponsor of I-Squared. In a July speech in Chicago, he emphasized the need for skill-based labor and the impact of globalization on the economy. His office declined to speak specifically about H-1B visas.Those who support increasing H-1B visas do so on the grounds of innovation, skills shortage and free market principles. Tech leaders claim that H-1B visas create more jobs in the U.S. for U.S. workers.Speaking to the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank, in March, Google (GOOGL) Chairman Eric Schmidt said, ""In the logic of Washington ... everyone actually agrees that there should be more H-1B visas in order to create more tech, more science, more analytical jobs . .. . Everyone agrees, in both parties.""But many in Washington and elsewhere do not agree with increasing the number of H-1B visas. Many scholars and analysts have long argued that there is no U.S. worker shortage in the STEM fields and that employers use the H-1B visa program to pay lower wages.A New York Times editorial said ""the system can be twisted"" into giving companies ""cheap, exploitable, disposable labor.""The H-1B program has also been criticized for not requiring employers to prove a need. Employers do not have to look in the U.S. workforce for a position before turning to foreign workers.""You can't discriminate by race or gender, but legally you can discriminate a U.S. worker,"" said Hal Salzman, a professor of public policy at Rutgers University. ""Make it truly what its intent was, which is to address shortages.""The I-Squared bill also would not require employers to demonstrate a need first.Scholars On Both SidesBoth sides of the debate have scholarship on their side.Research by Harvard University professor William Kerr and William Lincoln, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, found an increase in total science and engineering employment and invention with higher admissions of high-skilled immigrants.Research by Kirk Doran, an associate professor at the University of Notre Dame; Alexander Gelber, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley; and Adam Isen, an economist at the U.S. Department of Treasury; found that winning an additional H-1B visa does not improve innovation at a company, does have displacement effects, and does increase the firm's profit.Salzman, who has testified before Congress about the matter, has found that the U.S. supply of top graduates exceeds the hiring needs of STEM industries, wages in the IT industry have been stagnant for years, and the majority of guest workers fill entry-level positions.Congress has not taken action regarding H-1B visas, as discussions have stalled in the context of comprehensive immigration reform. While investigations into H-1B abuse are still underway, any arguments and legislation will have to address the potential for fraud.Salzman said it's a discussion of the U.S. workforce and the decision that U.S. employers make. ""It's not immigrant vs. native. It's about do I need a special category for guest workers or can I just hire through my normal hiring provision?,"" said Salzman. ""A large portion of IT are immigrants and those are getting the hardest hit.""

680,HAL,"Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics potentially leading to a robot apocalypse have been a popular theme in Hollywood this year. Already we've seen ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" ""Chappie"" and ""Ex Machina"" entertain audiences with the idea of a machine uprising.Next up is ""Terminator Genisys"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emilia Clarke. The latest in the ""Terminator"" robot apocalypse movie series opens in U.S. theaters on Wednesday.Beyond the entertainment industry, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and tech industry icons Bill Gates and Elon Musk have expressed worries about the dangers of AI.If the robot apocalypse is coming, the seeds of our destruction likely have already been planted. What follows is a look — mostly tongue-in-cheek — at the publicly traded companies that could play a part in the robot destruction of the human race.All of these companies are working on technologies that will benefit mankind, including smarter computers, self-driving cars and disaster response robots. But what if our robot friends suddenly decided they didn't want to serve us anymore?IBM (IBM) has been linked to the robopocalypse in the minds of the general public since ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The classic 1968 science-fiction film featured a murderous AI computer called HAL 9000. Many people have conjectured that the name HAL was based on a one-letter shift from the name IBM.Fast-forward to today, and IBM is a leader in artificial intelligence with its Watson computer system.After defeating puny humans on the TV game show ""Jeopardy"" in 2011, Watson has tackled bigger problems in fields such as health care and oil and gas production.In January 2014, IBM created a new business unit around Watson. Around that time, IBM CEO Virginia Rometty said she wanted Watson to generate $10 billion in annual revenue within 10 years.Internet search leader Google (GOOGL) has taken a keen interest in robotics, acquiring a number of companies in the emerging field. But it's been secretive about its plans.This month, Google-owned Boston Dynamics supplied Atlas humanoid robots to six competitors in the DARPA Robotics Challenge. One took the second-place prize of $1 million after completing a simulated disaster response scenario. Looking like Terminator's bulkier cousin, the Atlas robot stands 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 345 pounds.For the DARPA contest, the Atlas robot drove a car, exited it and walked through a course performing such tasks as opening a door, turning a valve, cutting a hole in the wall and climbing a set of stairs. Those tasks will come in handy for responding to disasters like saving a crippled nuclear power plant. They also would be useful for chasing down and killing humans.Boston Dynamics is known for its scary, fast-moving, quadrupedal robots like BigDog and Cheetah, developed for the U.S. military.In addition, Google is working on self-driving cars. For the robot apocalypse to happen, bots will have to move fast and travel great distances to exterminate mankind.E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) has deployed an army of 15,000 robots in its warehouses to retrieve shelves full of products and bring them to fulfillment workers. It also is exploring the use of robotic arms that can pick and pack items.Plus, Amazon is experimenting with aerial drones that it hopes can one day deliver packages within minutes to your doorstep. The Amazon Prime Air drone project was announced in late 2013 and has been slowed by government regulatory hurdles.Don't go thinking drones are harmless flying machines. Ask singer Enrique Iglesias. In May, a quadcopter filming his concert in Tijuana, Mexico, slashed some of his fingers. He had to undergo reconstructive hand surgery.In December, a mistletoe drone at a TGI Friday's restaurant cut someone's nose and chin.Now drones have a taste for blood.Bedford, Mass.-based iRobot (IRBT) is best known for home robots like the Roomba vacuum cleaner. It also makes virtual-presence robots that let people tour facilities and meet face to face with others over great distances.It also makes rovers for defense and law enforcement customers. These robots conduct reconnaissance, check out unsafe buildings, and assist in bomb detection and disposal. About 5,000 such robots from iRobot are in the field. They are performing dangerous missions and keeping human soldiers and police out of harm's way.IRobot's biggest military bot is the 710 Kobra. It weighs 500 pounds and can reach as high as 11.5 feet. With its tanklike tracks, it can reach speeds of up to 8 miles per hour, can easily climb stairs and fit through doorways and aisles.It's not hard to imagine that someday robots will be armed to take out enemy combatants via remote control. One step away from robot domination.Apple (AAPL) introduced its intelligent personal assistant Siri in October 2011. The female-voiced computer program can answer spoken questions, make recommendations and perform tasks like setting your alarm clock.Apple has continued to improve the usefulness and accuracy of Siri. The program started as an app on the iPhone and has migrated to Apple Watch and soon the Mac computer.Competing programs have cropped up, such as Cortana from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google Now.Siri has a personality and is known for talking sass to users when irritated. Given advancements in AI, I wouldn't want to get her too upset.When the history of the robot apocalypse is written, after John Connor or whoever defeats our robot overlords, historians may look to blame drone manufacturers.Unmanned aerial vehicles like the Predator combat drones built by General Atomics, a privately held defense contractor in San Diego, have been critical to the U.S. war on terrorist groups in the Middle East. Other U.S. drone makers include Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).These lethal drones are under human control from remote terminals. But if they become sentient, look out.If robots are ever going to be able to effectively hunt down humans, they're going to need good machine vision.Perhaps they'll use technology developed by Mobileye (MBLY). Its technology is being used for car safety systems, with an eye toward autonomous cars. Mobileye's camera-based advanced driver assistance systems are being used today by top automakers such as Audi, BMW, Chrysler (FCAU), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F), Honda (HMC) and Volvo.And if killer robots are going to see in the dark, they might use thermal imaging systems developed by Flir Systems (FLIR).If robots are going to take over the world, they'll need to mass-produce soldier robots.Who better to produce killer robots than industrial manufacturing robots?Leaders in industrial robots today include ABB (ABB), Fanuc, Kuka and Yaskawa Motoman.In May, ABB opened a robot-building operation in Auburn Hills, Mich., to be close to the Big Three U.S. automakers: GM, Ford and Chrysler.

701,HAL,"Planned job cuts surged in April as employers announced 61,852 layoffs, the most since May 2012, said placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.It was a 68% increase over March and 53% higher than a year earlier. In the first four months of 2015, cuts stand 25% higher than a year earlier.Plunging oil prices, which are pressuring energy firms directly and other sectors indirectly, are driving the reductions. Some 34% of the cuts in April and in the year to date are directly attributed to oil prices, Challenger said. Schlumberger (SLB) made up the biggest share, with 11,000 planned layoffs, but many other firms, among them Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL), have also announced layoffs. (Halliburton is buying Baker Hughes). Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Halliburton are all based in Houston.But the latest upsurge in layoff plans pales compared to 2008, when the credit crash triggered a deep recession and massive cuts among financial firms.

Boeing comprises nearly half of Ex-Im Bank's financing, which doesn't set well with Ex-Im's critics, including some heavy hitters in the business community.Delta Air Lines (DAL) has criticized the bank for financing the purchase of Boeing jets that are used by its foreign competitors. In 2012, Ex-Im backed bonds issued by Ethiopian Airlines to finance the export of four of 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft to Ethiopia.One of Boeing's main competitors, Airbus, is headquartered in France, a nation with its own export credit agency. Ex-Im's defenders argue that if buyers in Vietnam, Ethiopia or elsewhere can't go to Ex-Im for loans to buy Boeing jets, they'll buy an Airbus jet with the help of the French government, leaving Boeing — and the suppliers who depend on it — empty handed.Just last Thursday, a U.K. unit of Carlsbad, Calif.-based satellite maker ViaSat (VSAT) disclosed Ex-Im's latest big deal, a $525 million loan from Ex-Im to finance a satellite it's working on with Boeing.U.S. companies doing business in Mexico with Pemex, the state oil company, enjoyed the most guarantees from Ex-Im in 2013, $1.5 billion out of $1.76 billion.The single largest loan that year, $1 billion, went to Reliance Industries in India to finance generators for a petrochemical plant, a project of U.S. firms Fluor (FLR) and ConocoPhillips (COP).Ex-Im's friends note that comparisons of loan sizes and the number of loans are skewed because the cost of an aircraft or heavy equipment far outweighs the goods sold by small and midsize businesses.""It would take a lot of commercial refrigeration units to equal a jet plane or nuclear reactor,"" said Lauren Airey, director of foreign trade policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.With the U.S. home to some of the world's largest banks, why couldn't Boeing or other businesses bypass Ex-Im and head to private lenders for funding?""That's a fair question,"" Shenkar said. ""Why is it not happening? I suppose the risk-return equation is not there. There also is a limited number of banks that really have all the infrastructure, skill and expertise to deal with an international transaction.""President Obama, who supports reauthorization, in 2008 as a presidential candidate called the bank ""little more than a fund for corporate welfare.""His old criticism is still echoed by the bank's opponents.Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, chairs the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees Ex-Im's charter. He calls the bank's reauthorization ""a defining issue for our party and our movement. ..""There is probably no better poster child of the Washington insider economy and corporate welfare than the Export-Import Bank,"" he said. ""Its demise would be a resounding victory for the Main Street competitive economy.""The bank's critics argue that 0.01% of U.S. small businesses received help from Ex-Im to finance 1% of total U.S. exports in 2014.Hopefuls for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination also have chimed in. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Ex-Im ""should be phased out."" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called it a ""corrupt crony-capitalist fiasco"" while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called for its elimination.Last month, Heritage Action for America launched an ""End Ex-Im"" campaign that will inform voters in 31 Republican-held House districts that their representative supports reauthorizing the bank.""The question here is a moral one,"" said Barney Keller of the Club for Growth. ""How can you say you want to reform social welfare when you're not in favor of reforming corporate welfare?""

780,HAL,"Promises: Not long after FCC chairman Tom Wheeler swore that the FCC takeover of the Internet wouldn't result in new taxes or fees, it appears likely that new taxes will show up on Internet bills in the near future.In a speech a few weeks before the FCC voted to approve its ""net neutrality"" rules, Chairman Tom Wheeler promised there would be ""no tariffs, no new taxes"" as a result.Later that month, FCC spokeswoman Kim Hart promised that the new regulatory scheme ""does not raise taxes or fees. Period.""If that sounds suspiciously like Obama's promise that under ObamaCare you would be able to ""keep your plan. Period,"" there's a good reason.In mid-March, Wheeler told a House panel that he couldn't, in fact, rule out a new Internet fee to help pay for the government's ""Universal Service Fund"" (USF).By shoving the Internet into the agency's Title II regulatory scheme — which was set up 80 years ago to regulate the telephone monopoly — Wheeler made it possible to do so.He said a special board representing federal and state governments was weighing whether to impose that tax. Right now, the USF is paid for by a tax added to long-distance bills.""How they resolve things in the future I do not know,"" he told the House committee.Does anyone in their right mind believe that state and federal governments will say no to a brand new revenue source now that they can tap it?The Los Angeles Times doesn't seem to think so. An article published Thursday leads with: ""Recently adopted net neutrality regulations soon could make your monthly Internet bill more complicated — and potentially more expensive.""It quotes Hal Singer of the centrist Progressive Policy Institute, who figures the USF fee and various other charges that state and local government are likely to add to Internet bills will cost consumers around $11 billion a year.Wheeler has suggested that any new federal Internet fee could be offset by a lower charge on phone bills, so it would be a wash to the consumer.Right. Just last December, Wheeler authorized a $1.5 billion boost in the USF budget so he could spend more on subsidies for school and library broadband services, on top of the 47% boost in the fund's budget since 2004.Welcome to the brave new world of ObamaNet.

817,HAL,"Emerging from the recession, energy markets saw a robust real estate recovery as high oil prices ignited exploration and production investment in places like the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas and the Bakken in the Northern plains.Now oil's price plunge threatens to cap the recovery, particularly in cities like Houston, Oklahoma City and Williston, N.D.However, housing analysts such as the National Association of Realtors' Danielle Hale and Trulia's Jed Kolko expect potential slumps in home sales, prices and construction to be confined to energy markets.Largely based on expectations that a strong job market will induce millennials to become first-time homebuyers, the NAR projects that existing-home sales will climb 8% in 2015 and home prices 4% to 5%. It predicts that single-family home starts will jump 21%, and new-home sales 25%.""While uncertainty will have an effect on areas where the overall economy and jobs market are very tied to oil, there are enough areas that will benefit from lower oil prices,"" Hale said. ""So we're expecting the effect to be a wash nationally.""Outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas said Thursday that 38% of the nearly 104,000 U.S. job cuts in January and February were directly tied to oil, the price of which has dropped by about half since July. Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Weatherford International (WFT) alone have all announced layoffs totaling thousands of workers in the last several weeks.The 1,267 drilling rigs operating nationwide at the end of February represented a 28% drop from a year earlier, according to oil service firm Baker Hughes (BHI), which is being acquired by Halliburton.""I'm bullish about every sector of the national economy that's not in oil and gas,"" said Mark Dotzour, chief economist for the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. ""I'm not bullish about the oil and gas impact on Houston, Oklahoma City and Williston.""Housing demand in energy markets has yet to crater, and weakness likely won't surface until late 2015 or in 2016, according to a recent report on energy markets by Trulia, recently acquired by Zillow (Z).In Oklahoma City, some 20,500 homes sold in 2014, a 6.7% rise over 2013, according to the Oklahoma City Area Association of Realtors, which lumps together single-family homes with half-duplexes, condos and patio homes. The median price at year-end was $150,000, about $6,000 higher than a year earlier. In Houston, single-family home sales increased 2.8% in 2014 and the median home price surged 10.6% to $199,000, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.Waiting For The WaveStill, executives at homebuilders Lennar (LEN), Beazer Homes USA (BZH) and D.R. Horton (DHI), which are active in Houston, anticipate some softness in the market, according to comments made during their respective earnings calls in January.Houston-based apartment developer Camden Property Trust (CPT) also projects a slowdown, particularly with 20,000 new apartments slated to open in Houston this year.Even so, its same-store annual revenue growth has averaged 8% over the past four years in the market, and executives expect it to fall only to the 20-year average of 3.4%, according to remarks on the company's earnings call in January. Unlike the oil bust in the 1980s, when Houston was more dependent on the energy industry, the area now boasts strong health care and port sectors, as well as significant refining and petrochemical industries, Dotzour says. He adds that potential homebuyers in careers that are tied to the energy industry, including attorneys and accountants, are in a ""wait-and-see mode.""""I think the unknown right now is, how will the people outside the oil and gas industry respond to the uncertainty in the energy business?"" Dotzour said. ""Will a cardiologist choose to delay buying a home just because three or four oil executives own homes in the neighborhood?""Falling oil prices failed to keep Houston office landlords from lifting rents 3.6% to $27.35 a square foot in 2014, even with 16.6 million square feet under construction, according to commercial property brokerage Transwestern.Between layoffs and firms looking to sublet unused office space, the area's average vacancy rate has likely ticked up 90 basis points from 10.2% at the end of 2014, says Kevin Roberts, president of Transwestern's Southwest operations.Transwestern predicts that Houston's vacancy rate will climb above 12% over the next two years. Office tenants and buyers are already starting to push for better deals, he says, but landlords are hardly panicking.""Everybody is looking for 2015 to be a little bouncy,"" he said. ""The good news is that the real estate is not financially impaired — tenants are pretty healthy and paying rent, and occupancies are still high.""Building Homes In The BakkenIn northwest North Dakota, Williston is ground zero for the Bakken oil formation and is in the midst of a severe housing shortage. The number of residents more than doubled to 29,595 from 2010 to 2014, and a 2014 Williston Economic Development report projected the city's population to approach 40,000 in 2017. Observers remain upbeat, given the steady environment.""Demand has tempered a bit, but for the most part it's still going strong,"" said Terry Metzler, operations manager for Casper, Wyo.-based Granite Peak Development, a land developer that entered the market in 2011.He acknowledges that apartment rents started to decline in the area, but he attributes most of it to an increase in supply.Developers applied for 422 single-family, multifamily and commercial property building permits valued at $435 million in 2014, up from 276 permits totaling $291 million in 2013, according to the Williston Area Home Builders Association.Among other projects, private equity firm KKR & Co. (KKR) and Denver-based Continuum Partners are developing the Ridge, a community of 1,537 single-family homes, apartments and town houses.Like real estate observers in other energy markets, Metzler hopes the oil price dip is temporary. He notes that as drilling has slowed, work at producing wells continues.""I don't think you're going to see the amount of apartments being built slow down that much,"" he added. ""If we see an extremely prolonged period of very low oil prices, we might see things change.""

Existing state and local rules will remain in force. The bulk of increased oil production in recent years has been on private and state land.Interior initially proposed changes in 2012, with rules expected by year-end. That was pushed back, with a new draft proposal issued in May 2013.

821,HAL,"One of Lee Iacocca's last acts in public life was his October 2012 endorsement of Mitt Romney for president. Iacocca's simple written statement did not have the desired effect — after all, Romney lost.But it was noticed and welcomed by a wave of voters despite coming from someone so long retired.The reason was simple: Iacocca was the man Romney hoped voters would see when they considered voting for him. The Republican nominee had also turned around enterprises.Iacocca's turnaround story began in 1978, when his fast-lane career was sideswiped.Leaving FordHe had been in the car business 32 years, rising to president of Ford Motor (F) and popular with everyone except the man who mattered — Henry Ford II, the chairman who would fire him with a simple explanation: ""Sometimes you just don't like somebody."" Iacocca wrote about that dart and noted that he might have retired then and played golf had Ford not gone to such lengths to disrespect him.According to Iacocca, the grandson of the firm's founder spent $2 million to investigate him and his contacts beginning in 1975 while insinuating, falsely, that he was tied to organized crime.Ford, who died in 1987, viewed Iacocca as a threat to his own position as chairman, according to Peter Collier and David Horowitz's ""The Fords."" Shortly before Iacocca's autobiography was published, Ford criticized him for being ungracious in public comments after their split, although he claimed not to have ""any animosity"" toward him.Iacocca got even — and more important — he saved himself from a remaining life of bitterness and ""stewing in my own anger.""He kept himself going by moving on to one of Ford's rivals.Within five years, he would not only save Chrysler, but also make himself a trusted household name, which to this day evokes business acumen, ""straight talk"" and an ability to find the right use for talent.Iacocca, 90, no longer gives interviews or manages any business affairs. But it is a testament to his influence that he remained in the public eye as long as he did.At age 80, he appeared in a 2005 Chrysler ad with rapper Snoop Dogg. Two years later he published his last book, ""Where Have All the Leaders Gone?""Iacocca's eponymous 1984 memoir — considered by many an indispensable book on management — devotes 150 pages to the compelling tale of his time at Chrysler.In late 1978, he arrived at the car firm's headquarters in Highland Park, Mich., as CEO and found upper management in such disarray that he wondered if he made a mistake taking the job.""I already knew about the lousy cars,"" he wrote of Chrysler's suffering reputation. ""I was well aware of the bad morale and the deteriorating factories. But I simply had no idea that I wouldn't even be able to get hold of the right numbers so that we could begin to attack some of Chrysler's basic problems.""Shifting GearsAfter firing 33 of the company's 35 vice presidents and bringing in his own, leaner team, Iacocca set out to fix Chrysler's many inefficient and inexplicable processes.He had to: Establish financial controls. End the manufacturing division's practice of haphazardly building cars without regard for what dealers wanted. Earn back the dealers' trust.""Chrysler's quality had been so poor,"" he wrote, ""that the dealers got into the habit of expecting to rebuild the cars when they received them.""Despite his company's acute financial woes, Iacocca spent freely on new quality controls. In his mind, he could hardly afford not to.Poor workmanship was sullying the Chrysler brand and diminishing customer loyalty — plus costing the company millions to honor its warranties after sale.Chrysler was facing a much more immediate problem — a shortage of cash, which the onset of the 1979 energy crisis and the subsequent recession did not help.In 1979 and 1980, Iacocca fired or laid off nearly 16,000 employees at all levels, saving half a billion dollars annually. He called it the hardest thing he had to do at Chrysler.""You have to put yourself in the other guy's shoes,"" he wrote of the firings, ""and recognize that no matter how you dress it up, it's a pretty bad day in anyone's life."" He had been through it himself, after all.Iacocca sold off Chrysler's foreign holdings and divisions unrelated to the core business. He unloaded $90 million in real estate.But even this would not be enough to save a company $4.75 billion in debt and making no money.When his efforts to find a savior investor failed, Iacocca took another unpleasant step that would redound as an important precedent 30 years later. He went to Congress, hat in hand. ""Ideologically, I've always been a free-enterpriser,"" Iacocca later wrote.But as he saw it, no other options remained. He had done everything he could to save Chrysler.Calling On WashingtonNow it was a government loan guarantee or bust.The arguments that Iacocca made in seeking a bailout will sound familiar today. Bankruptcy would scare away car buyers and kill off suppliers. Chrysler's failure would cost the government $16 billion in ""unemployment, welfare and other expenses."" The government owed Chrysler because it had done so much to hurt the company with environmental and safety regulations.Even in those days, Iacocca could cite precedents for such loan guarantees. ""In fact, a total of $409 billion in loans and loan guarantees was outstanding when I made our $1 billion request,"" Iacocca wrote.It wasn't easy, but Congress granted $1.5 billion (worth $5 billion today) in loan guarantees, and Iacocca paid them off seven years early, with fees and interest.Before that happened, Iacocca showed just how well he understood his skeptical audience of taxpayers and workers when he reduced his own salary to $1.""It really makes a statement,"" car expert Lauren Fix told IBD. ""It says, 'I'm sufficiently confident in what I know I can do that I'm not going to take money out of a struggling company.'""No one could accuse Iacocca of asking others for sacrifices that he was unwilling to make himself.The $1 salary drew an outpouring of support from common people, celebrities and even the union bosses whom Iacocca faced across the table in Detroit.""I discovered that people accept a lot of pain if everybody is going through the chute together,"" he wrote.By 1984, when his company was on firm footing again, Iacocca's straight talk was making him a star in Chrysler TV ads — which he agreed to do after realizing it would save the firm a lot of money over hiring celebrity endorsers.After introducing and praising his company's cars, he would freely tell consumers, ""If you can find a better car, buy it.""Iacocca's account of his time at Chrysler is more moving for what he reveals only at the end. Mary, his wife of 27 years and mother of their two daughters, had begun suffering heart complications from diabetes in 1978, leading to her death in 1983. He retired in 1992 and has been a champion of diabetes research — among other things founding a food company (Olivio Premium Products), all of whose profits he donated to the cause.Iacocca, the son of Italian immigrants, was a sharp boy who kept good grades while growing up in Allentown, Pa. After attending Lehigh University, he cut his teeth at Ford in sales and marketing.Philly StakesHis first big coup came in 1956, a difficult year for Ford sales.His Philadelphia sales district, where he was assistant manager, came out on top when he offered new models for just 20% down and monthly payments of $56 — ""Fifty-six for '56.""It worked, and it got him noticed.Years later, Iacocca sold Ford's management on the Mustang — to this day one of the all-time classic American cars, ""emblematic of the European small roadsters,"" said Hal Sperlich, chief architect of the snappy auto that came out in 1964.""He was the energy behind the project,"" Sperlich said of Iacocca. ""He was the ideal person to take the risks needed to pursue the opportunity.""The Mustang made more than $1 billion its first year — the equivalent of $7.6 billion today.Years later, Iacocca and Sperlich, both exiled by Henry Ford II, ended up together again at Chrysler, where Sperlich would later become president.The duo proceeded to usher in another industry-changing vehicle — the minivan. The resulting Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager were less sexy than the Mustang. But they were huge hits, helping Chrysler survive. Today it's headquartered in Auburn Hills, Mich., and part of Italy's Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), with annual sales of $95 billion and a stock that has doubled since October.Iacocca's vans were practically family friends and are still part of American culture. A bit like him.

832,HAL,"Amid plunging oil prices, Texas factory activity flattened in January and the outlook looks bleak, the Dallas Fed found in its January survey.The headline production index was 0.7, indicating output was little better than in December, and also barely into positive territory. Other gauges were little better: New orders dropped to -7.7, the first negative read in nearly two years. The growth rate of the new-orders index was among the worst performers, with a -18 read.Measures of general business conditions were negative, and one forecasting the next six months touched its lowest since April 2009. ""Oil below $50 is tough,"" one respondent told the Dallas Fed. ""We'll have to see how long it takes to stabilize.""Yet despite the negativity in other parts of the survey, and the reality that plunging energy prices may hit Texas hard, the employment gauge remained strong. Two-thirds of those surveyed reported no change in their number of employees, while 20% reported increases.However, several big energy players have already slashed capital spending plans, with several announcing job-cut plans, including Houston-based oil service giants Schlumberger (SLB) and soon-to-merge Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI).

Revenue climbed nearly 15% to $8.77 billion, just shy of views for $8.78 billion.Shares were up in the stock market today.Revenue from North America was flat sequentially, while revenue in the Middle East/Asia region rose 10% vs. Q3 with increased integrated project activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India and Indonesia. Latin America sales were up 3% sequentially .""We delivered an excellent 2014, but it is clear that 2015 will be a challenging year for the industry,"" said CEO Dave Lesar in the earnings release. ""As a result of the weakening outlook, during the fourth quarter of 2014 we took a $129 million restructuring charge to temper the impact of anticipated activity declines.""Last week Schlumberger (SLB) announced it was slashing its capital spending and workforce on the recent collapse in oil prices as its customers scale back their exploration and production spending.But on Tuesday, Schlumberger announced a deal to buy a 45.65% stake in Russia's Eurasia Drilling Co. for $1.7 billion. The agreement gives Schlumberger the option of buying the rest of the company three years after the deal closes.Sterne Agee analyst Stephen Gengaro lowered his price target on the company to 92 from 95 but still expects Schlumberger to ""outperform its peers in the face of stiff market headwinds buoyed by its strong technology portfolio, diverse geographic footprint, laser-sharp focus on execution, aggressive cost-cutting initiatives, robust free cash generation, and willingness to return excess cash to shareholders.""Baker Hughes (BHI), which is being bought out by Halliburton, also reported earnings above estimates Tuesday. But like Halliburton, it warned of a difficult 2015 and announced plans to cut 7,000 workers""While market demand ended up being more resilient in the fourth quarter than many had predicted, the recent declines seen in rig counts will clearly affect results in 2015,"" CEO Martin Craighead said in the earnings release.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

955,HAL,"Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.With oil prices near six-year lows and capital budgets getting slashed, drilling has shifted to the most economic acres that can yield positive returns at low prices.In a recent report, Citigroup analysts said those areas include the northeastern and southwestern parts of the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania, the eastern counties of the Eagle Ford in Texas, the Midland Basin in the Permian, the Wattenberg Field in Colorado, and certain portions of the Bakken shale.But exploration could be more muted in ""more fringe"" areas like the Powder River Basin, the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale in Louisiana and Mississippi, and the Brown Dense formation in southern Arkansas and northwest Louisiana.Among the companies Citigroup covers, capital budgets for 2015 reflect a 33% drop to $64.6 billion vs. 2014 levels. Citi analysts previously had predicted an 18% decline.On Tuesday, Matador Resources (MTDR) said it would stop drilling operations in the Eagle Ford formation in Texas and issued a budget lower than last year's. On Monday, Concho Resources (CXO) cut its spending, and Linn Energy (LINE) cut its budget on Friday.Last month, Laredo Petroleum (LPI) lowered its 2015 spending by over 40% vs. 2014. Continental Resources (CLR) said it wouldn't add any new rigs this year. ConocoPhilips (COP) lowered its 2015 budget by 20%, and Chevron (CVX) scrapped plans to drill in the Canadian Arctic.The ""Goldilocks"" era has come to an end, Citi declared, after the E&P sector benefited from strong commodity prices and efficiency improvements in the past two years.""However, this is a cyclical industry and the near-term outlook has turned quite dire,"" according to its report released Wednesday.Still, Citi believes the core of most North American shale or resource plays should see positive rates of return, even with oil prices of $55-$65 per barrel — Citi's current estimates for U.S. crude in 2015 and 2016 respectively.Those returns will get help from an expected drop in oilfield services costs across the industry, Citi said. Indeed, anecdotal evidence points to some operators already seeing savings of 20%.But despite lower prices charged by services giants like Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB), Citi doesn't see the cost savings being enough to offset the effect of falling oil prices.Benchmark U.S. crude futures sank 46% in 2014 and continued to tumble when the new year began. They have stabilized in recent days, but the strong dollar and Saudi Arabia's unwillingness to cut production are still putting downward pressure on prices.With lower oil prices and smaller budgets, production in Citi's coverage group is expected to rise 9% this year vs. an earlier outlook for a 14% gain.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

968,HAL,"Immigration: Executive amnesty for illegal aliens has been greeted with resignation by some members of Congress who say the president's action, though wrong, is legal, and that nothing can be done about it. Neither is true.The consensus in Washington on the president's amnesty for 5 million illegals is perhaps best summed up by Brookings scholar William A. Galston. ""History may judge Mr. Obama's move to be unwise,"" he wrote last week in the Wall Street Journal, ""but it is not illegal.""Well, for our part, we believe Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution is quite clear. It states: ""The Congress shall have power to ... establish a uniform rule of naturalization."" The president overstepped his bounds.Some have also argued Obamnesty can't be stopped because U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency responsible for administering immigration, is funded not directly by Congress but by fees.""The Appropriations process cannot be used to 'de-fund' the (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or CIS) agency,"" said Rep. Hal Rogers, head of the House Appropriations Committee. ""The agency has the ability to continue to collect and use fees to continue current operations ... even under a continuing resolution or a government shutdown.""But in fact, it can be stopped — and we don't have to wait for a court to act.That's not just our opinion; it's also the opinion of the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS), as first revealed by Breitbart Big Government correspondent Matthew Boyle.In a report last week to incoming Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jeff Sessions, CRS concluded that ""funds available to the (CIS) agency through fee collections would be subject to the same potential restrictions imposed by Congress on the use of its appropriations as any other type of appropriated funds.""So while it may be politically convenient to think Congress' hands are institutionally tied on immigration, they're not. Obama's outrageous amnesty can be overturned in several ways.One would be through a government shutdown — which, admittedly, Republicans are unlikely to do, fearing a media-driven backlash.Another is to pass something Obama likes, then attach a provision that would prohibit spending on amnesty. Still another is to fund the rest of government, but refuse to fund anything to do with amnesty.Sure, any of these bills would face an Obama veto. But it would force congressional Democrats to make a tough decision — side with Obama or side with the voters who overwhelmingly reject Obama's unilateral action. They can't have it both ways.Whatever, the new Republican-led Congress isn't helpless. It can use its lawful power of the purse to overturn a lawless presidential action. And it should.

No stocks in the group currently get very high Composite Ratings from IBD.Reports that Iran will follow Saudi Arabia in cutting oil prices will likely create ""stiff headwinds"" for companies in the oilfield services industry, according to a new report from Sterne Agee, though bigger players such as Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL) should weather things better than others.IBD's Oil & Gas-Field Services industry group has been hard-hit in the stock market, down 18% since the end of August and down 11% for the year to date.In a note released Friday, Sterne Agee analyst Stephen Gengaro said ""crude oil price weakness likely persists short term"" amid tensions within the OPEC cartel.These tensions are leading to an ""apparent price war,"" Gengaro added, ""with Iran cutting oil prices for crude buyers in Asia. This appears to be the result of Saudi Arabia's decision to lower prices last week without typical discussions with other members of the cartel.""A rise in oil and gas production in North America, combined with slowing demand in Asia and political strife in the Middle East, are behind the lack of cooperation between OPEC members, Gengaro noted. Although he expects this to have minimal impact on oilfield activity for the balance of 2014, a continued slide in crude oil prices ""will likely hamper 2015 activity,"" especially in North America.""We continue to prefer large cap, diversified names in our coverage universe,"" Gengaro said. ""Our favorites remain Schlumberger and Halliburton.""Both of those stocks are part of the Oil & Gas-Field Services group, which ranks No. 182 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD.

To ease antitrust concerns, Halliburton may divest businesses with up to $7.5 billion in revenue, and the company said it already has identified several potential buyers.Morgan Stanley analysts said Schlumberger may be on the hunt to regain its spot as the largest oilfield service provider by revenue, writing in a note that ""industry consolidation will become a forced response to activity slowdown and overcapacity.""Giants Look To PounceEdward Jones analyst Rob Desai told IBD another large oilfield service merger looks less likely, though GE (GE) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) could buy makers of oilfield equipment.In September, Siemens (SIEGY) agreed to buy compressor and turbine maker Dresser-Rand (DRC) in a $7.6 billion deal, and GE reportedly weighed making an offer as well.Baker Hughes had been batted around for years as a possible target, and Halliburton has been looking to become a larger company to compete against Schlumberger (SLB), Desai said.The recent decline in the price of oil also underscored Baker Hughes' weakness in its margins, which Desai said trail those at Halliburton and Schlumberger.Still, despite exploration and production companies trimming expansion plans, service providers should see more demand. Because yields at shale wells drop quickly, new wells must be drilled just to maintain the same level of production.""The baseline level of activity to keep production where it is now is higher than it's been in the past,"" Desai said. ""So even if there is no growth, they still have to provide more services to their customers.""In the frac sand and proppant space, M&As have been heating up. In July, U.S. Silica (SLCA) bought Cadre Services, and Eagle Materials (EXP) bought CRS Proppants in October.Jack Kasprzak, managing director at BB&T Capital Markets, said he wouldn't be surprised to see more M&As in the sector.""You're seeing consolidation in the frac sand industry because you need reserves,"" he said. ""Your customer base is consolidating too, and they want to deal with fewer suppliers.""

1205,HAL,"Vladimir Putin could save American motorists hundreds of billions of dollars — if the Russian president's aggressive moves in Ukraine prompt U.S. lawmakers to lift the ban on exporting domestic crude.
"
1206,HAL,"A growing number of GOP and Democratic lawmakers have stepped up calls to end the virtual ban, which allows some exports to Canada. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz has said the Obama administration is mulling the idea.
"
1207,HAL,"While there is increased sentiment for eliminating the decades-old ban, U.S. refineries and environmental groups oppose any change.
"
1208,HAL,"The ban started in the 1970s as an attempt to protect Americans from price spikes, some of which were caused by Middle Eastern countries using oil as a political weapon.
"
1209,HAL,"Shale Boom, Crude Policy
"
1210,HAL,"Many economists and politicians on both sides of the aisle believe the oil gushing from previously unreachable shale reserves in Texas and the Dakotas has made the policy outdated and detrimental to the people it was trying to protect — the consumers.
"
1211,HAL,"Since gasoline prices are set on global markets, cheap U.S. crude hasn't meant big savings for American drivers. Meanwhile, refiners have enjoyed fat profit margins from sales of their processed products, which don't face an export ban.
"
1212,HAL,"""The biggest argument against lifting the ban is 'Why should we export a commodity that can be extremely valuable?' But that is a short-term focus,"" Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones, told IBD.
"
1213,HAL,"""The argument is about protectionism. But oil is a global market so why not be a bigger part of that global market?""
"
1214,HAL,"By opening new markets for drillers, lifting the ban would increase domestic crude production from 8.2 million barrels per day to 11.2 million barrels per day in 2022 and create 1 million jobs by 2018, according to a recent IHS report.
"
1215,HAL,"That boost would save U.S. drivers an average of 8 cents per gallon on gas, or $265 billion from 2016-30, IHS reckons, as the flood of new crude on world markets lowers international benchmarks used for gas prices.
"
1216,HAL,"Futures for West Texas Intermediate settled at $104.35 a barrel Tuesday, below London-based Brent crude prices of $109.52. Lifting the ban would narrow the price gap between American and Brent crude.
"
1217,HAL,"Other industries have found ways to exploit this split. Delta Air Lines (DAL) even bought its own refinery, in large part because of the disparity between U.S. and overseas crude prices.
"
1218,HAL,"Global Markets, Local Profits
"
1219,HAL,"Despite the rising calls to end the ban, plenty of its supporters remain. Refiners are the most clear-cut winners while crude is kept at home.
"
1220,HAL,"For the past three years, North American refiners have been considerably more profitable than their European counterparts due in part to lower crude prices in North America vs. world prices, according to a recent Energy Information Administration report.
"
1221,HAL,"In the first quarter, earnings per processed barrel were more than $6 higher at North American refineries than at European rivals, EIA said.
"
1222,HAL,"IHS argues that the ban has created ""gridlock"" as refining capacity can't handle the amount of light crude being produced. While most U.S. refineries are set up to handle the heavy crude from South America, companies like Valero (VLO) are retooling to process the light crude.

1234,HAL,"""I think it will be repealed. But as to when, that's the unknown.""Vladimir Putin could save American motorists hundreds of billions of dollars — if the Russian president's aggressive moves in Ukraine prompt U.S. lawmakers to lift the ban on exporting domestic crude.A growing number of GOP and Democratic lawmakers have stepped up calls to end the virtual ban, which allows some exports to Canada. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz has said the Obama administration is mulling the idea.While there is increased sentiment for eliminating the decades-old ban, U.S. refineries and environmental groups oppose any change.The ban started in the 1970s as an attempt to protect Americans from price spikes, some of which were caused by Middle Eastern countries using oil as a political weapon.Shale Boom, Crude PolicyMany economists and politicians on both sides of the aisle believe the oil gushing from previously unreachable shale reserves in Texas and the Dakotas has made the policy outdated and detrimental to the people it was trying to protect — the consumers.Since gasoline prices are set on global markets, cheap U.S. crude hasn't meant big savings for American drivers. Meanwhile, refiners have enjoyed fat profit margins from sales of their processed products, which don't face an export ban.""The biggest argument against lifting the ban is 'Why should we export a commodity that can be extremely valuable?' But that is a short-term focus,"" Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones, told IBD.""The argument is about protectionism. But oil is a global market so why not be a bigger part of that global market?""By opening new markets for drillers, lifting the ban would increase domestic crude production from 8.2 million barrels per day to 11.2 million barrels per day in 2022 and create 1 million jobs by 2018, according to a recent IHS report.That boost would save U.S. drivers an average of 8 cents per gallon on gas, or $265 billion from 2016-30, IHS reckons, as the flood of new crude on world markets lowers international benchmarks used for gas prices.Futures for West Texas Intermediate settled at $104.35 a barrel Tuesday, below London-based Brent crude prices of $109.52. Lifting the ban would narrow the price gap between American and Brent crude.Other industries have found ways to exploit this split. Delta Air Lines (DAL) even bought its own refinery, in large part because of the disparity between U.S. and overseas crude prices.Global Markets, Local ProfitsDespite the rising calls to end the ban, plenty of its supporters remain. Refiners are the most clear-cut winners while crude is kept at home.For the past three years, North American refiners have been considerably more profitable than their European counterparts due in part to lower crude prices in North America vs. world prices, according to a recent Energy Information Administration report.In the first quarter, earnings per processed barrel were more than $6 higher at North American refineries than at European rivals, EIA said.IHS argues that the ban has created ""gridlock"" as refining capacity can't handle the amount of light crude being produced. While most U.S. refineries are set up to handle the heavy crude from South America, companies like Valero (VLO) are retooling to process the light crude.Environmentalists also don't want to see increased drilling, especially the hydraulic fracturing used to tap shale deposits, and are opposed to allowing more pollution-causing oil to reach world markets.Some politicians also still aren't convinced that exporting crude wouldn't increase volatility for consumers.

"
1247,HAL,"Bob Feller rose with courage — in baseball and World War II.Named the greatest living right-handed pitcher in baseball in 1969, Feller was a first-ballot Hall of Famer in 1962.Beyond that, he achieved the rarity of legend status.""Feller is the best pitcher living,"" said fellow legend Joe DiMaggio, the Yankee Clipper, as quoted in ""Bob Feller: Ace of the Greatest Generation"" by John Sickels. ""I don't think anyone is ever going to throw a ball faster than he does.""Feller (1918-2010) went straight from high school to the majors, making his debut for the Cleveland Indians in 1936 at age 17.Even at that tender age, he knew he could never let himself be overwhelmed by any situation if he were to win in the majors.In The HeatHe got a taste of the big leagues in a July exhibition game vs. the St. Louis Cardinals, whose stars he had watched in person two years earlier in the World Series. He went from fan to opponent.In ""Now Pitching, Bob Feller"" by Feller with Bill Gilbert, the fireballer wrote: ""Scared? Never. Not in my entire pitching career was I ever scared of any hitter or any situation. That's a luxury you can't afford if you're going to make it as a pitcher. Challenges and crises are what pitching is.""In that exhibition, Feller struck out eight Redbirds in only three innings. And he was just warming up.In August, he made his first official start after six relief appearances — and mowed down 15 St. Louis Browns in a victory.In September, 17 Philadelphia Athletics succumbed to his nearly 100 mph fastball as Feller tied what was then the major league single-game strikeout record. He passed the mark two years later by striking out 18 Detroit Tigers.""You have to have the talent, but if you're out there with any question in your mind at all about your ability to win and your ability to defeat every single hitter who stands up there as a threat against you, then you're going to be a failure,"" Feller wrote. ""I wasn't about to let that happen to me.""Playing from 1936 to 1956 with the Indians, Feller compiled a 266-162 won-loss record, a 3.25 earned run average, 2,581 strikeouts and three no-hitters.He also helped Cleveland win the 1948 World Series title, the Indians' last.Feller accomplished all that despite losing more than three prime years to Navy combat in WW II.Detroit slugger Hank Greenberg said that facing Feller meant dealing with blinding speed and ""a very deceptive motion. You never knew where the ball was coming from.""Hal Naragon, who caught Feller for the Indians, told IBD: ""Bob had a great desire to be successful, and he worked awful hard at it. He had a lot of determination, a lot of confidence. He kept himself in wonderful physical condition.""Born on a farm in Van Meter, Iowa, Feller learned baseball from his father, Bill, who had been a semipro player.A Ball With DadBill Feller played catch with young Bob and tutored him in pitching. As the 12-year-old prodigy dominated American Legion ball, Bill built a field of dreams on the farm, complete with seats and a scoreboard. It was a way to develop and showcase his son, and Bill even charged fans 35 cents a seat.Young Bob soared to semipro ball. Then a scout, Cy Slapnicka, signed him for the Indians.Before his rookie 1936 season was over, the New York Times reported that Feller's name was ""on the tongues of a million fans,"" as cited on the Feller Museum website.He was just 18 when Time magazine put him on its cover in 1937.His 1938 high-school graduation was covered live on radio by NBC.Feller was careful not to be seduced by fame: ""I was being rushed by events into celebrity status, something I didn't care about one way or the other. The only thing I cared about was becoming a good pitcher, good enough to win consistently in the big leagues.""By 22, Feller had won more career games than any pitcher his age: 107 vs. 54 losses. He zipped through the 1939-41 seasons with records of 24-9, 27-11 and 25-13 — and led the American League in strikeouts for four straight years.Into The FrayWhen the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, bringing the America into the war, Feller became the first major leaguer to enlist. Because his father was dying of cancer and Bob was the sole support for his family, he was exempt from military service.He was having none of that.""Why enlist? Why not keep playing ball as long as you can . .. making what we considered big bucks?"" he wrote. ""That wasn't the way most young men felt. ... We were outraged about Pearl Harbor and what Hitler was doing in Europe. We didn't just fight to protect ourselves. We wanted to take those guys on and beat the living hell out of them, and I wanted to be a part of that.""After six months of working for former heavyweight champ Gene Tunney in the Navy's physical-fitness program, Feller volunteered for gunnery school.Half a year later, he became chief of an anti-aircraft gun crew on the battleship Alabama.Feller recalled that Capt. F.D. Kirtland, the ship's skipper, gave them four rules for combat:• ""Your guns and ammunition must be in the pink of condition.""• ""You must see your enemy first.""• ""You must shoot first."" • ""You must hit first, or you might not get off another shot.""Feller credited Kirtland with the crew surviving eight of the bloodiest invasions of the war in the Pacific without having anyone killed or wounded. ""I'm no hero,"" Feller told Sickels in 2002. ""Get this straight. The heroes didn't come back. Only the survivors did.""Bob DiBiasio, the Indians' senior vice president of public affairs, knew Feller well. He told IBD: ""The lessons that can be learned from Bob's selfless sacrifice, his character, his farm-boy work ethic and Midwestern values extend far beyond the game of baseball.""With the war over in the late summer of 1945, Feller traded his Navy duds for Cleveland's uniform and picked up right where he left off.He went 5-3 the rest of the 1945 season, then tore through the American League the next year — going 26-15 with a 2.18 ERA while striking out 348, a modern-day record that lasted two decades.Feller fired away for a 20-11 record in 1947 and 19-15 in Cleveland's World Series-winning campaign of 1948.Three years later, he produced another stellar season, going 22-8.Feller took a page out of the military lessons he'd learned: ""My 1951 baseball season was sort of a peacetime adoption of the Capt. Kirtland code. I was going to be in my best physical condition ever, and I was going to get the upper hand against the 'enemy' by getting off to a fast start and maintaining a winning pace all season long.""In 1954, Feller's 13-3 record helped the Indians win 111 games and the pennant. Yet they kept the 35-year-old out of the rotation in the World Series, which saw Willie Mays and the New York Giants stun Cleveland in four games.When it came to physical fitness, Feller wrote: ""I worked out with weights and barbells, and did stretching exercises 25 years before they became widespread. I was ... always doing something to maintain my peak physical condition so I would have an edge on the competition. ... I've never minded extra work, and I didn't mind it then. It was all part of what athletes call being willing to pay the price.""Feller also believed in running as a training staple for pitchers: ""It's critical for pitchers to get in as much running as they can, all year long. ... They should run sprints in the outfield during batting practice. If they are going to be winning pitchers, their legs must be as strong as their arms because legs do just as much work in the act of pitching a baseball.""Besides mastering his heater, Feller worked with the same diligence on his breaking ball.""I was never afraid to throw my curve when I was behind in the count ... or even late in the game in a pressure situation,"" he said.""His curveball isn't human,"" DiMaggio said.On Bob Feller Day in Cleveland in his last season of 1956, he was honored with gifts and a telegram from an old friend and baseball fan, President Eisenhower:""Your outstanding record in baseball, together with your war record in the United States Navy and your peace time in many charities and community projects, makes a fine example of American manhood.""Feller saw a correlation between his sport and society: ""You get to wash the slate clean and start all over again. That's the way life is, with a new game every day, and that's the way baseball is.""
"
1248,HAL,"How do you follow a legend?
"
1249,HAL,"That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.
"
1250,HAL,"Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.
"
1251,HAL,"Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.
"
1252,HAL,"Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.
"
1253,HAL,"The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.
"
1254,HAL,"Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.
"
1255,HAL,"IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?
"
1256,HAL,"Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.
"
1257,HAL,"IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.
"
1258,HAL,"Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.
"
1259,HAL,"IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?
"
1260,HAL,"Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.
"
1261,HAL,"IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?
"
1262,HAL,"Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.
"
1263,HAL,"We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.
"
1264,HAL,"IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?
"
1265,HAL,"Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.
"
1266,HAL,"IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?
"
1267,HAL,"Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.
"
1268,HAL,"IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?
"
1269,HAL,"Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.
"
1270,HAL,"IBD: What's your biggest bet?
"
1271,HAL,"Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.
"
1272,HAL,"IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?
"
1273,HAL,"Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.
"
1274,HAL,"He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.
"
1275,HAL,"We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.
"
1276,HAL,"Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.
"
1277,HAL,"IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?
"
1278,HAL,"Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.
"
1279,HAL,"IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?
"
1280,HAL,"Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.
"
1281,HAL,"I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)
"
1282,HAL,"People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.
"
1283,HAL,"But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.
"
1284,HAL,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?
"
1285,HAL,"Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.
"
1286,HAL,"I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).
"
1287,HAL,"IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?
"
1288,HAL,"Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.
"
1289,HAL,"What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.
"
1290,HAL,"IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?
"
1291,HAL,"Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.
"
1292,HAL,"They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.
"
1293,HAL,"And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.
"
1294,HAL,"We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.
"
1295,HAL,"IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?
"
1296,HAL,"Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.
"
1297,HAL,"We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.
"
1298,HAL,"IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?
"
1299,HAL,"Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.
"
1300,HAL,"IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?
"
1301,HAL,"Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.
"
1302,HAL,"I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.

1303,HAL,"And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.
"
1304,HAL,"IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?
"
1305,HAL,"Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.
"
1306,HAL,"IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?
"
1307,HAL,"Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.
"
1308,HAL,"They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.
"
1309,HAL,"IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?
"
1310,HAL,"Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.
"
1311,HAL,"IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?
"
1312,HAL,"Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.How do you follow a legend?That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.IBD: What's your biggest bet?Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility.

"
1458,HAL,"By the late 1990s, Walt Disney shareholders could have whistled toward work — or retirement.
"
1459,HAL,"The company stood atop the entertainment world, growing strongly as its animation division churned out hits, its live-action films flowered, and its dusty video library turned into content gold.
"
1460,HAL,"Shares surged 8,943% from their 1984 low to their March 2014 peak, with the biggest run from '84 to '98.
"
1461,HAL,"But in the spring of 1984, all of that was far off.
"
1462,HAL,"A few years after the death of the visionary founder Walt in 1966, Disney (DIS) foundered under weak leadership and little sense of direction. Once the company's crown jewels, the animated movies had fallen by the wayside, and its live-action films — think of ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" (1965) and ""Tron"" (1982) — weren't much better.
"
1463,HAL,"In fiscal 1982, net income plunged 18% and fell 7% again the following year. The next year, corporate raider Saul Steinberg targeted Disney, which eventually paid him $32 million to go away.
"
1464,HAL,"The Disney board knew that it needed change. In September of 1984, Michael Eisner started as CEO and chairman, and Frank Wells as president.
"
1465,HAL,"""It was a fabulous management team. People were at their absolute best,"" said Chris Dixon, who covered Disney as a PaineWebber analyst at the time. ""Eisner was terrific in terms of imagination and energy, and Frank, because of his long-term experience, added a little gray hair.""
"
1466,HAL,"""The '80s were golden,"" said Hal Vogel, a long-time entertainment industry analyst and investor who wrote ""Entertainment Industry Economics."" ""It was a very positive change and a very fruitful period.""
"
1467,HAL,"One of the team's first smart moves, analysts say, was to recognize the cash potential of Disney's assets. By the early 1980s, the theme parks were generating 70% of company income, according to the website Funding Universe.
"
1468,HAL,"""They sensed correctly that they could raise ticket prices and not affect demand for the parks,"" Vogel said.
"
1469,HAL,"In fact, raising ticket prices by just $1 would yield $30 million more per year, wrote Kim Masters in ""The Keys to the Kingdom: The Rise of Michael Eisner and the Fall of Everybody Else.""
"
1470,HAL,"Disney got lucky with demographics, says Vogel, as children of baby boomers got old enough to appreciate the theme parks. But it was a stroke of genius, not luck, that led Eisner to see Disney's existing film stock as an asset to be tapped.
"
1471,HAL,"""Such a bounty has fallen into my lap. Every day a new asset falls out of the sky,"" Eisner said in Masters' book. Wells was said to have quipped, ""Every time I open a door at this company, there's money behind it.""
"
1472,HAL,"No company had thought of marketing videocassettes cheaply enough that parents could buy them for children to watch over and over, Masters wrote, and that brainstorm made video a ""staggering source of revenue"" for Disney. Its video library, more than those of most studios, was easily distributed overseas because the films didn't require a lot of sophisticated translation.
"
1473,HAL,"Eisner's recognition that old content had value changed the face of entertainment. It helped cable fill empty channels and gave rise to new business models such as Netflix (NFLX) and Roku.
"
1474,HAL,"Again, Disney was in the sweet spot. Consumers weren't the only ones looking for videocassette content; scores of new TV channels also needed it, and Disney had family-friendly films galore.
"
1475,HAL,"To create new movie and TV content, Eisner and Wells hired Jeffrey Katzenberg, who'd worked under Eisner at Paramount, as Disney Studios chairman.
"
1476,HAL,"Under Katzenberg's direction, Disney revitalized its animation division, turning out hits like ""The Little Mermaid,"" which won two Oscars and grossed a record-setting $85 million; ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the first animated film to be nominated for a best-picture Oscar; and ""The Lion King,"" which took in a staggering $423 million in theatrical box-office revenues according to the website BoxOfficeMojo.
"
1477,HAL,"Katzenberg ""lit a fire under people,"" said Bill Cotter, author of ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television."" Cotter worked for that Disney medium for years.
"
1478,HAL,"Thomas Sito, who helped animate many of the hit films of the Disney renaissance, including ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin,"" believes another manager was also key to that revival: Roy Disney, Walt's nephew, who became head of the animation division in 1984.
"
1479,HAL,"Roy was personally invested in the revival of animation, which had been the Disney Co.'s heart and soul. Sito told IBD that when it came to making decisions about the quality of the products, Roy used to growl, ""I have to care. My name's on the damn door.""
"
1480,HAL,"The entire management team focused on bringing that sense of quality back to Disney films, Sito says. That was partly due to outside competition; former Disney animator Don Bluth had left and was producing popular animated films such as 1986's ""An American Tail.""
"
1481,HAL,"Katzenberg used to liken Disney's status as synonymous with quality family entertainment just as the Kleenex brand is to tissues.
"
1482,HAL,"""It was very exciting at the time, because as artists we always had faith in the art of animation and its ability to entertain,"" Sito said.
"
1483,HAL,"Disney's new successes also showed Hollywood that animation could be big business again. The Lucasfilm spinoff Pixar had enormous hits with ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo"" and other films before being bought by Disney in 2006. And Katzenberg had hits like the ""Shrek"" films at DreamWorks Animation (DWA) after leaving Disney.
"
1484,HAL,"Eisner, who was president of Paramount Pictures when Disney tapped him for the CEO job, also knew that there was value in live-action, non-G-rated movie fare. Disney had established Touchstone Films in 1983, before Eisner started, and had even had a hit with the Tom Hanks comedy ""Splash.""
"
1485,HAL,"Eisner gave Touchstone lots of attention, and Touchstone hits such as ""Outrageous Fortune,"" ""Ruthless People"" and ""Pretty Woman"" were box-office gold.
"
1486,HAL,"Eisner also expanded the moneymaking theme parks. He broadened Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., via a partnership with MGM for a studio-themed entertainment park, which opened in 1989.
"
1487,HAL,"But Eisner thought even bigger. Tokyo Disneyland had opened in 1983, and while it did well, it was considered a missed opportunity because Disney had leased its characters and name to a local concessionaire rather than owning everything in the park outright. Still, Vogel said, ""It was quite lucrative, and Europe was the next logical decision."" Eisner began working on establishing a Disneyland in Paris: Euro Disney, which opened in 1992.
"
1488,HAL,"Vogel lauds the decision to pursue global expansion. It spread Disney products to consumers around the world and reinforced the brand's iconic status.
"
1489,HAL,"More than that, Eisner's long-distance shift meant that every interaction that a consumer had with Disney sparked another. A theme-park vacation would remind children of a love for Disney films, and re-viewing an old favorite movie could send a parent to buy a toy with a character's likeness. Some 22% of Disney's revenue came from international operations by 1991.
"
1490,HAL,"All of those ventures were a prelude to one of Eisner's biggest steps: buying ABC/Capital Cities in 1996 for $19 billion. ""Once they were successful in being able to expand and demonstrate they could take the company to the next level and scale it, the next step was buying ABC,"" Dixon said.
"
1491,HAL,"The acquisition got Disney a broadcast network along with TV and radio stations — plus ESPN, which at the time had 95 million worldwide viewers. ""ESPN was the crown jewel,"" Vogel said.
"
1492,HAL,"The purchase was especially bold because it guaranteed Disney a network for its programs, Masters notes.
"
1493,HAL,"ABC could air new Disney programming, which could be resold as reruns to cable. Yet Disney remained focused on quality entertainment rather than on churning out lots of content to dump on the network, says Cotter.
"
1494,HAL,"The sense of rebirth touching the film animators reached the TV division as well, Cotter said: ""The more you keep a feeling of fire and ambition under a creative crowd, the more they're going to rise to the occasion.""
"
1495,HAL,"Disney's market cap increased from $2 billion to $53 billion from 1984 to 1996. Eisner could point to 18 new businesses into which he'd led the company since taking the reins, including professional sports teams, live Broadway shows and Disney stores.
"
1496,HAL,"""In the history of American business, this was a great group of people who complemented each other at the same time as expanding demand for American entertainment and rapidly developing technology delivered entertainment in new and different ways,"" Dixon said.By the late 1990s, Walt Disney shareholders could have whistled toward work — or retirement.The company stood atop the entertainment world, growing strongly as its animation division churned out hits, its live-action films flowered, and its dusty video library turned into content gold.Shares surged 8,943% from their 1984 low to their March 2014 peak, with the biggest run from '84 to '98.But in the spring of 1984, all of that was far off.A few years after the death of the visionary founder Walt in 1966, Disney (DIS) foundered under weak leadership and little sense of direction.

1501,HAL,"For much of the world, the recent unrest in Egypt and Tunisia raised the usual concerns about political instability in the Middle East and higher prices at the gas pump.But for large corporations that make a living in the oil industry, the upheaval was good for business.Many of these corporations were doing well enough even before massive demonstrations hit Tunisia and Egypt. When tensions in the region escalated, causing a spike in crude oil prices, most oil-related stocks spiked as well.One of those stocks, Halliburton (HAL), rose 16% over a seven-session period from Jan. 26 through Thursday. Shares hit a 2 1/2-year high.Halliburton, based in Houston, provides products and services to the energy industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. It operates in two segments: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.Crude PricesThe rise in crude prices likely contributed to Halliburton's recent stock uptick. So did the company's strong position in non-Middle East regions, which figure to see a rise in value if tensions continue to escalate in Egypt and elsewhere.North America has been a particularly robust market for Halliburton, despite problems in the Gulf of Mexico tied to last April's explosion and oil spill at BP's Macondo field. The North America region accounted for 61% of the company's operating profit and 51% of its revenue during the fourth quarter.""North America (produced) surprisingly strong revenues in the fourth quarter,"" Citigroup analyst Robin Shoemaker noted. ""The strong 10% sequential top-line gain took place in spite of a rig count improvement of only 4% quarter-over-quarter and a decline in Gulf of Mexico activity after the Macondo relief well work was completed in the third quarter.""The slowdown in the Gulf of Mexico has been partly offset by strong activity in other oil- and gas-producing regions in North America.The Bakken formation, which covers parts of Montana, North Dakota and Saskatchewan, has been particularly productive, analysts say.The average number of frac stages at Halliburton's Bakken operation has more than doubled over the past two years. A frac stage monitors the process of fracturing rock formations so drillers can stimulate oil and gas wells.Meanwhile, Halliburton's revenue per rig in North America rose 5.5% sequentially last quarter and reached an all-time high of $10,235, according to JPMorgan analyst J. David Anderson.The increase came ""despite very little contribution from the Gulf of Mexico, which typically has higher service intensity per rig,"" Anderson wrote in a report. ""Onshore, this is partly due to increased rig efficiency, where wells drilled per rig is up 15%. As long as the emerging rig count continues to increase and the mix shifts from gas to oil, we are confident the revenue per rig day will keep moving higher.""Halliburton's success in North America prompted Citi analyst Shoemaker to raise his 2011 forecasts for the company. He expects 25% revenue growth from Halliburton's North American operations this year, up from an earlier estimate of 10% growth. He also raised his EPS estimates for 2011, 2012 and 2013.""We believe North American margins will prove resilient and that capacity expansions will be consistent with demand growth,"" Shoemaker wrote.JPMorgan's Anderson has an equally optimistic near-term outlook.

1502,HAL,"For much of the world, the recent unrest in Egypt and Tunisia raised the usual concerns about political instability in the Middle East and higher prices at the gas pump.But for large corporations that make a living in the oil industry, the upheaval was good for business.Many of these corporations were doing well enough even before massive demonstrations hit Tunisia and Egypt. When tensions in the region escalated, causing a spike in crude oil prices, most oil-related stocks spiked as well.One of those stocks, Halliburton (HAL), rose 16% over a seven-session period from Jan. 26 through Thursday. Shares hit a 2 1/2-year high.Halliburton, based in Houston, provides products and services to the energy industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. It operates in two segments: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.Crude PricesThe rise in crude prices likely contributed to Halliburton's recent stock uptick. So did the company's strong position in non-Middle East regions, which figure to see a rise in value if tensions continue to escalate in Egypt and elsewhere.North America has been a particularly robust market for Halliburton, despite problems in the Gulf of Mexico tied to last April's explosion and oil spill at BP's Macondo field. The North America region accounted for 61% of the company's operating profit and 51% of its revenue during the fourth quarter.""North America (produced) surprisingly strong revenues in the fourth quarter,"" Citigroup analyst Robin Shoemaker noted.

1503,HAL,"Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, after the market closes. The company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share in each of the preceding two quarters, with high costs hindering bottom-line growth.What is worse is that the dismal performance is likely to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter as well. This railroad operator’s disappointing price performance in the first quarter (January-March period) further highlights the gloomy scenario. The stock has lost 11.4% of its value in the three-month period, faring worse than its industry’s 3.4% decline.The negative sentiment surrounding the stock can also be gauged from the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings moved south 11.1% over the last 60 days. The consensus mark for the same too decreased 9.1% on year-over-year basis.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deep to unearth the factors that are likely to influence the company’s first-quarter results:We expect Canadian National’s results to be hurt by the network congestion problems that have led to customer dissatisfaction due to service delays. In February 2018, oilfield service major — Halliburton Company's (HAL  -  Free Report) — stated that Canadian National’s service delays have been affecting its bottom line, thus underlining the gravity of this situation.Additionally, rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited’s (CP  -  Free Report) commentary about its increasing network fluidity highlights the fact that these operational issues are likely to affect Canadian National’s customer base. This, in turn, might adversely impact its growth prospects in the to-be-reported quarter, unless resolved quickly.In fact, Canadian National announced a change at its helm in the first week of March to primarily address the service issues. The new CEO (interim) — Jean-Jacques Ruest — has apologized to its customers for the service woes and promised an improvement on the service front. Even if the new CEO fulfills his promise, we believe that it will take time and the change is unlikely to significantly impact the railroad’s first-quarter results.Service issues apart, high labor and fuel costs are expected to weigh on Canadian National’s bottom line. Rise in costs are likely to hurt operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, Canadian National’s high debt levels remain potent threats. However, we are impressed by the 10% dividend hike announced by the company in January 2018.Canadian National Railway Company Price and EPS Surprise  Canadian National Railway Company Price and EPS Surprise | Canadian National Railway Company Quote What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Considering the above-mentioned downsides, our proven model too does not show that Canadian Nationalis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Canadian National’s has an Earnings ESP of -2.10% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a cent below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Canadian National’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP, making us even less confident of an earnings beat. As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderWith Canadian national likely to disappoint, investors interested in the railroad space may consider Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report). Our model shows that Union Pacific possesses the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in its next release.Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved.Zacks’ has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market.Click here to access these stocks. >>

1504,HAL,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1008 in the week (ended Apr 13) compared with the prior week’s 1003. Notably, total count increased eight times in the last 10 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 847.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher offshore and onshore operations. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 16 compared with 12. Also, the number of onshore rigs totaled 988, marginally higher than 987.Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the figure reported in the week ended Apr 6.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose to 815 from 808 for the week ended Apr 6. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 683. The oil rig count rose eight times in the last 10 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 192 is lower than 194 for the week ended Apr 6.However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 162.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 55 units dropped from 56 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by six units to 953 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 16 units — 15 rigs were oil-directed — higher than the tally of 12 for the week ended Apr 6.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of two oil rigs in Cana Woodford shale play and three oil rigs in the Eagle Ford.The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading above $65 per-barrel-mark, thanks to the intensified middle east tensions. The missile strike in Syria by the United States and allies Britain and France will likely pave the way for America’s strong stance against Iran and Russia. Iran and Russia reportedly backed Syria for conducting the suspected chemical attack on Douma people. Hence, there is considerable room for rally in oil prices which could support the persistent ramp up of drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and Antero Resources Corporation (AR  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. We expect Continental to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 376.5% in 2018.Antero will likely see year-over-year earnings growth of 303% in 2018.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1505,HAL,"Shares of Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) have lost 11% in the past six months, significantly underperforming its industry’s gain of 6.1%. Reasons Behind the Price PlungeThe company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion for the past few months, which have hurt its operational performance. Further, oilfield service major, Halliburton Company's (HAL  -  Free Report) statement issued in February 2018 that Canadian National’s service delays have been affecting its bottom line, underlines the gravity of this situation.Additionally, rival Canadian Pacific Railway Limited’s (CP  -  Free Report) commentary about its increasing network fluidity highlights the fact that these operational issues might affect Canadian National’s customer base and adversely impact its growth prospects, unless resolved quickly.In March 2018, Canadian National also announced a change at its helm to primarily address the service issues. The new CEO (interim) — Jean-Jacques Ruest — has apologized to its customers for the service woes and promised an improvement on the service front. However, in case the management change fails to yield the desired results, the stock might be hurt further.Deterioration in operating ratio (defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) due to high labor and fuel costs also does not bode well for the stock. Canadian National’s high debt levels raise concerns as well.Furthermore, the stock has a VGM Score of C, which too highlights its unattractiveness. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows investors to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Zacks Rank & Key PickCanadian National carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the broader Zacks Transportation sector is FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of FedEx have gained 14.5% over the last six months.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

(DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).   DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 981 in the week (ended Mar 2) — higher than the prior week’s 978. Notably, the total count increased for four in the prior six weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated with a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 756.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 963, higher than 959. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, up from the count of two for the week ended Feb 23.  However, the tally for offshore was 14, down from 17 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 800 was up from 799 for the week ended Feb 23. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 609. It should be noted that since 2015, the count of rigs exploring for oil touched 800 for the first time.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 181 was up from 179 for the week ended Feb 23. With this, the tally increased thrice in the last four weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 146.  Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 59 units decreased from 67 units. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 11 units to 922 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 14 units — 13 of which were oil-directed — compared with 17 units for the week ended Feb 23.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of two gas rigs in the Marcellus shale play.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

1507,HAL,"Wall Street closed sharply lower on Wednesday ending its four-day winning streak. All three major stock indexes closed in the red. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a second round of tariffs worth $200 billion on Chinese goods halted the four-day market rally. Investors remain confused between strong expectations of second quarter earnings supported by a fundamentally robust U.S. economy and prolonged trader tensions between the United States and China.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,700.45, declining 0.9% or 219.21 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.7% to close at 2,774.02. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,716.61, shedding 0.6%. A total of 6 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.9 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2.74-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.87-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 7.8% to close at 13.63.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow was down 0.9% and once again entered negative territory year to date. Notably, 24 of the 30-stock blue-chip index closed in the red while 5 traded in the green and 1 remain unchanged.The S&P 500 slumped 0.7% led by 2.1% drop in Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE), 1.7% decline in Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) and 1.6% fall in Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) partially offset by a 0.9% gain in Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU). Notably, ten out of 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.Likewise, tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 0.6% primarily due to poor performance of chipmakers that have a large business stake in China.U.S. - China Trade War Escalates The ongoing trade conflict between United States and China is showing no signs of abating. In March, Trump administration announced first phase of 25% U.S. tariffs worth $50 billion. First part of these tariffs worth $34 billion was implemented from Jul 6 and the remaining $16 billion of tariffs will be implemented within next two weeks.On Jul 10, the U.S. government released a list of 10% tariffs on Chinese goods worth $200 billion. The new tariffs will undergo a two month review and hiring after which final decision will be taken. Last week, President Trump had threatened China that his administration may consider the possibility of imposing new tariffs worth $300 billion on China if it retaliate U.S. tariffs. However, China has retaliated with $34 billion of tariffs imposed on U.S. exports.Energy Stocks Plunge Energy stocks plunged on Wednesday on trade war concerns and some positive news on the supply side. These two developments overshadowed the government report which revealed that for the week ending Jul 6, the U.S. crude oil inventory dropped significantly by 12.6 million barrels from the previous week.Investors fear a full-flagged global trade war will slow economic growth reducing oil demand worldwide. Moreover, supply concerns eased as OPEC reported that Saudi Arabia enhanced oil production in June to its highest level since the end of 2016. Further, four Libyan oil ports have returned to normalcy after Tripoli-based National Oil Corp (NOC) lifted the ban imposed on February.Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated on Tuesday that Trump administration will consider requests from some countries to be exempted from sanctions that United States will impose on Iran since November.On Jul 11, the WTI crude dropped $3.73 or 5%, to settle at $70.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude fell $5.46 or 6.9% to end the session at $73.40 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.Consequently, share price of energy behemoths like Chevron Corp.

(DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1052 in the week ended Jul 6, up from 1047 in the previous week. This marked an increase after the rig count fell for three consecutive weeks.Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 952.For the week under review, the rise in rig count can be only attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1029, up from 1024. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, in line with the prior week’s count. Also, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week, same as the count for the week ended Jun 29.   Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 863, up from 858 for the week ended Jun 29, marking an increase after a decline for two weeks in a row.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 763.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 is flat with the week ended Jun 29.Per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.4% below the all-time high of 1,606 recorded in 2008. Unlike oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is below the year-ago tally of 189.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 55 units, down from the prior week tally of 56. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by six units to 997.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 18 units, of which 15 were oil-directed. The count is in line with the week ended Jun 29.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States increased primarily due to the addition of three oil rigs in the Williston Basin and one in each of the Eagle Ford and Permian basins.   West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is trading close to $75-a-barrel psychological mark. As of now, worries of intensifying trade war tensions between the United States and China have gripped the energy market, keeping investors in the dark the direction of commodity prices.

1509,HAL,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company reported a decline in U.S. rig count.About the Rig Count Baker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.A change in the Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1047 in the week ended Jun 29, down from 1052 in the previous week. This marked a decline in rig count for three weeks in a row.  Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 940.For the week under review, the fall in rig count can be only attributed to reduced onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1024, down from 1032. However, the tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, up from the prior week’s count of 18. Also, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week, higher than two for the week ended Jun 22.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 858, down from 862 for the week ended Jun 22, marking a decline for two straight weeks.However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 756.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 lags 188 for the week ended Jun 22. Notably, the tally for gas rigs fell for three consecutive weeks. Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.4%, below the all-time high of 1,606 in 2008.  However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 184.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 56 units, down from the prior week tally of 60. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by one unit to 991.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is 18 units, of which 15 were oil-directed. The count is in line with the week ended Jun 22.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring in the United States declined primarily due to the removal of three onshore rigs from Texas and two from North Dakota.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is again approaching the $75-a-barrel psychological mark. Although the pricing scenario of oil is favorable for drillers, the production possibilities in the domestic shale plays — especially the Permian — remain dull owing to the pipeline bottleneck problem. In other words, the bottleneck in transportation capacity and labor shortage have made Permian operations expensive.Despite the unfavorable business scenario, investors may bet on a few oil and gas explorers.

1510,HAL,"National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to form a joint venture (JV) with Saudi Aramco for manufacturing onshore rigs and equipment in Saudi Arabia. The latest development will brighten prospects of the energy services sector in Saudi Arabia and boost future growth potential of National Oilwell.The Rig-Building JV DealThe JV, which will serve as a major hub for high-specification rigs with breakthrough technologies, aims to construct up to 10 onshore drilling rigs annually. It will also supply advanced drilling equipment, spare parts and packages for jack-up rigs, along with providing repair and maintenance services for the sophisticated drilling technologies.Located at Ras Al Khair on the kingdom’s east coast, the facility will lead to the creation of around 1,000 jobs. While the project is likely to be completed in 2020, the first rig is expected to be delivered in 2021.Houston-based National Oilwell will own 70% stake in the JV and Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil/gas entity will hold the remaining 30%. The tie-up is also supported by Saudi Aramco’s partnership with Nabors Industries Limited (NBR  -  Free Report), which has already agreed to purchase 50 onshore rigs over a period of 10 years.Deal Motive for Saudi AramcoWith the deal leading to the creation of high-specification land rigs along with providing after-market services in Saudi Arabia, it will advance the kingdom’s oil services industry. It will help in encouraging trade with locally produced goods and services. Of late, Saudi Aramco has entered into strategic alliances with various U.S. oil companies including Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Weatherford International PLC, among others, to promote bilateral business between the two countries.The deal is in sync with Saudi Arabia’s reform program “Vision 3030,” as the JV will bolster the kingdom’s manufacturing capabilities, and spur economic diversification along with the creation of jobs. Under the reform plan, the country aims to fuel economic modernization and foreign investment. Saudi Aramco’s plans for IPO are also part of Vision 3030, as the company intends to diversify globally.While the IPO-offering plans have made a slow progress, the company is gearing up for downstream efforts, and aiming to maximize value by making investments in refineries and chemical plants. Saudi Arabia is taking a keen interest in investing in Texas petrochemical plants, and the refineries in Corpus Christi and Port Arthur. In fact, it is planning to invest $18 billion in its U.S. subsidiary, Motiva Enterprises LLC's Port Arthur refinery that has a processing capacity of 603,000 barrels of crude per day.Just a week ago, Saudi Aramco announced its collaboration with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to foray into the retail petroleum business in India. Both the company signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a consortium of three Indian national oil companies for investing in the development of $44-billion mega refinery in Ratnagiri.Encouraging Prospects of National OilwellNational Oilwell Varco is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment in the world, boasting an impressive business model. Strong demand for the firm’s onshore-focused Wellbore unit offers strong upside potential. The latest JV with Saudi Aramco is expected to boost the prospects of National Oilwell going forward, thereby driving revenues and earnings.While offshore-levered Rig Technologies is still bearing the brunt of reduced activities and declining backlog, the gradual uptick in the oil prices is likely to spur a recovery in the offshore segment in the coming period. In fact, last month, National Oilwell inked a deal to acquire a Dutch offshore rig design and engineering company, GustoMSC, boosting the former’s supply chain. The deal is considered as a vertical integration. The acquisition strengthens National Oilwell’s hold in the offshore industry, expanding equipment-providing business to the upstream companies.National Oilwell currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1511,HAL,"Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) will separate from parent company General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), which is planning to lower exposure in the volatile energy sector.Over the next two to three years, General Electric will likely sell its 62.5% stake in Baker Hughes to strengthen its balance sheet and simplify operations. In July 2017, General Electric had acquired Baker Hughes and merged the affiliate with its oil and gas equipment and services businesses.However, investors didn’t cheer the acquisition as following its closure, share prices of both the companies plunged. Baker Hughes has lost 39.2% since the acquisition, underperforming the 5.3% collective decline of the stocks belonging to the industry, while General Electric slipped 49.1%.Although crude prices have made a massive comeback, Baker Hughes scattered international operations could not benefit from the surge in commodity prices. Also, demand for drill bits and refinery valves of Baker Hughes will likely be blunt in the long term since the energy market is expected to be hurt by limited operational possibilities in prime oil plays and political disturbances, Bloomberg added.All those uncertainties might have convinced General Electric to offload Baker Hughes stake. Sonny Randhawa of Seaport Global Securities LLC announced that the entire interest of General Electric in Baker Hughes will not be sold through corporate buyout but will involve a number of share divestments. Randhawa added that Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) might be potential buyers but they will not get the approvals from the regulators.Baker Hughes is a leading oilfield service player. Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

(RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 978 in the week ended Feb 23 — higher than the prior week’s 975. Notably, the total count increased for three in the prior five weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 754.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 959, higher than 956. Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, up from the count of one for the week ended Feb 16.  However, the tally for offshore was 17, down from 18 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 799 was up from 798 for the week ended Feb 16. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 602.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 179 was up from 177 for the week ended Feb 16. With this, the tally increased twice in the last three weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 151.  Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 67 units increased from 65. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by one unit to 911.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 17 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — compared with 18 for the week ended Feb 16.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of two oil rigs in each of Permian basin and Cana Woodford resources. Moreover, the Utica and Haynesville basins added one natural gas rig each.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Concho Resources Inc.

1514,HAL,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 17% in the past month, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HAL due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsHalliburton reported better-than-expected fourth quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales. With higher commodity prices supporting the surge in oil production and drilling activity, the company issued an upbeat outlook.The world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger saw its income from continuing operations (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs and charges associated with U.S. tax reform) come in at 53 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents -- the fourteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,940 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,567 million.Strong North America, and Improving International MarketAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing, particularly for pressure pumping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one and half years since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its Completion and Production unit revenue grew 8% sequentially, ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth.Additionally, the outlook for Halliburton’s international market continues to improve. In fact, regional sales were up 11% sequentially in the fourth-quarter, driven by strong activity gains across a number of product services lines in Latin America, as well as increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere.Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $552 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $85 million. The division also improved from previous quarter’s income of $525 million, helped by improved pressure pumping activity and pricing in the North American land market. Further, Halliburton experienced a year-end bump in the Gulf of Mexico completion tool sales, while software sales in Latin America and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere were higher as well.Meanwhile, Drilling and Evaluation unit profit improved from $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 to $291 million this year. The number was also above the $180 million earned in the September quarter. The outperformance was on account of higher drilling activity in the Middle East and North America. This was supported by higher software sales and services in Latin America.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was $439 million. For the full year, capital spending was $1,373 million.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $2,337 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,430 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter compared to two lower.Halliburton Company Price and Consensus  Halliburton Company Price and Consensus | Halliburton Company Quote VGM ScoresAt this time, HAL has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a B. However, the stock was also allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, HAL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1515,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE), reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.Details on Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 947 in the week ended Jan 26 — higher than the prior week’s 936.

Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 712.  For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations – the tally rose from 916 to 929. The tally for inland waters was 1, in line with the count for the week ended Jan 19. However, the number of offshore rigs were 17, lower than 19.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 759 jumped from 747 recorded for the week ended Jan 19.

In the basin, the number of oil rigs has been rising for four weeks in a row. Four rigs were added in the Marcellus shale play.              Crude is trading above the $65-per-barrel psychological mark, which might lead to ramped up activities by oil drillers in domestic shale plays.

1517,HAL,"Oil services behemoths Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) have kick-started the fourth quarter energy earnings season in style. Results of the two biggies – providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells – are closely followed events. They serve as barometers of oilfield activity, providing a glimpse into demand trends for energy services like drilling, completion, production.Schlumberger, Halliburton Comes Up with Upbeat Q4The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-ago figure of 27 cents. Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong fourth-quarter results.Smaller rival Halliburton reported better-than-expected fourth quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs and charges associated with U.S. tax reform) came in at 53 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents – the fourteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,940 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,567 million.The Road AheadBoth companies, apart from coming out with estimate beating numbers, indicated that activity in North America remain strong even as the international market continues to improve.Schlumberger, which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services, believes that the positive oil market sentiment will push up North American investment by upstream operators. Meanwhile, the international market is expected to witness 5% higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline.Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing, particularly for pressure pumping. Additionally, the outlook for Halliburton’s international market continues to improve. In fact, regional sales were up 11% sequentially in the fourth-quarter on the back of strong activity gains across a number of product services lines in Latin America, as well as increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere.What the Positive Results Mean for the Oilfield Services SectorThe strong earnings reports naturally pleased investors. Consequently, shares of Schlumberger and Halliburton have surged 4% and 7% since their respective releases. Moreover, the companies' positive outlook for their U.S. and international operations bode well for the health of the oil industry. As it is, crude has been on a stellar run over the past few months.The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong fourth-quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended 2017 at $60.42 per barrel – the first settlement above $60 since June 2015. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $53 per barrel mark.Importantly, higher commodity prices continue to spur U.S. production to near-record levels supporting the surge in oil production and drilling activity. The U.S. rig count has jumped around 35% from same time last year, reflecting strong demand for oilfield services. And unlike the past few quarters, the tight domestic market is complemented by a gradually improving foreign business that is witnessing a spurt in tendering activity.Overall, the improving macro scenario is likely to translate into significant cash flows for the oilfield service operators.How to Pick the Right Stocks?To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight three oilfield service stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance.

1518,HAL,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported rig count decline in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, which is issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.A change in the Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by firms like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1059 in the week ended Jun 15 and fell from 1062 in the previous week. This decline was a first as the tally rose for 10 weeks in a row.Despite rig count slipping to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, it has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. The current national rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 933.    For the week under review, the fall in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1035, down from 1039. However, the number of rigs operating in the inland waters was four last week, higher than three for the week ended Jun 8. Also, the tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 20, in line with the prior week’s tally.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 863, up from 862 for the week ended Jun 8. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 747.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 194 is lower than 198 for the week ended Jun 8. Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 in 2008.However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 186.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs totaled 60 units, down from 61 units. Along with that, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations), fell by two units to 999.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units, of which 16 were oil-directed. The count is in line with the tally for the week ended Jun 8.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States declined due to the removal of four onshore rigs in Texas and two in Alaska.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to hover around $65-a-barrel psychological mark. Investors are waiting for the OPEC meetings on Jun 22, 2018, when the major crude producers including Russia will decide on extension or relaxation of the earlier-signed production curb deal. In other words, the outcome of the OPEC meetings is likely to provide new direction to oil price.Meanwhile, investors can buy two energy stocks with strong growth prospects per our proprietary model.

1520,HAL,"The short squeeze explanation notwithstanding, there are logical fundamental reasons for oil prices to have reversed course as they did
"
1521,HAL,"When almost the entire market is worried about overvaluation, U.S. blue-chip companies have brought sweet surprises for investors in the form of revenue growth. As per an article published on Financial Times, revenue growth at blue-chip US companies like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) are beating analyst expectations at almost the decade-best rate (read: 4 Sector ETFs Winning on Revenue Growth).Oil-service bellwether Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), fast food giant McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) and social-media darling  Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) surpassed sales expectations last week (read: Decent Oil Service Earnings Fail to Perk Up ETFs).As per the Earnings Trends issued on July 26, 2017, about 34.2% of the S&P 500 companies have reported this reporting cycle. Among these, 70.8% companies beat top-line estimates while 78.9% beat on the bottom line.Why Revenue Growth is a Bullish SignInvestors should note that sales are harder to be influenced in an income statement than earnings. A company can land up on decent earnings numbers by adopting cost-cutting or some other measures that do not speak for its core strength. But it is harder for a company to mold its revenue figure.Secondly, according to chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust, when corporate revenues are rising in a low inflation backdrop like this, it signifies “true demand-based revenue increase”. These gains are likely to be volume driven, not realization driven, which points to a recovering consumer segment. A still-low interest rate environment and energy prices maybe have been boosting the consumer area.Weaker Dollar: A Boon for Blue ChipsThe year 2017 has been all about greenback weakness, with the U.S. currency ETF PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish ETF (UUP  -  Free Report) losing about 8.7%. The fund has dived over 5% in the last three months (as of July 28, 2017) (read: Rising ETFs in a Falling Dollar Environment).Political uncertainty in the Trump administration has kept the greenback from soaring. Investors should also note that lower-than-expected expansion in the fiscal policy given the ongoing political drama has prompted the IMF to downgrade U.S. growth to 2.1% for 2017 and 2018 from the previous projections of 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively.The Fed also stayed away from an extremely aggressive policy tightening – after two rate hikes this year – due to subdued inflation (read: ETF Winners & Losers on IMF Growth Forecast).This makes us think that this is the right time to bet on large-cap stocks rather than the smaller ones. Large-cap stocks perform better in a weaker dollar environment since the former has substantial foreign exposure. So, negative currency translation risk gets minimized in a falling dollar environment.Financial Times reported that an analyst with AllianceBernstein indicated, “the weaker dollar appears to be a factor this season as global companies have posted 300 basis points better growth than those with higher domestic revenue exposure.”Global Economy on the MendSince large-caps rely heavily on foreign economies, the health of the Euro zone, Japan and emerging economies is very important in taking investing decisions. The IMF upgraded 2017 GDP growth projections for the Euro zone by 0.2 percentage points from April to 1.9%. High levels of public investment also led IMF to beef up its Chinese growth forecast.The IMF also nudged up the 2017 growth forecast for Japan to 1.3%, from 1.2% forecast in April. Emerging markets, as a whole, are also better placed now. All these point at better demand from foreign economies.ETFs to PlayIf you are convinced by the above-mentioned reasonings, you can try a few large-cap ETFs mentioned below.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) The fund comprises 30 blue-chip U.S. stocks. Industrials, information technology, financials and consumer discretionary are the top four sectors of the fund. The fund charges 17 bps in fees.First Trust Mega Cap AlphaDEX Fund (FMK  -  Free Report)The underlying index of the fund tracks the performance of stocks on the NASDAQ AlphaDEX Mega Cap Index.

1522,HAL,"Oil price worries have been rife this year despite the ongoing OPEC output cut. The prolonged travails of the commodity oil saw a short-lived reversal following the OPEC output cut deal signed late last year and the extension of the same this year. Against this backdrop, a close monitoring of the energy space that deals with the extraction of oil is warranted.Presently, the Zacks Industry Rank for oil service companies is in the bottom 17%. Thanks to a downbeat industry rank, energy investors should be on high alert this earnings season as everyone is keen on finding out where the space is heading. Let’s delve a little deeper into the earnings picture and see how things are shaping up for the space.In this piece, we have considered two stocks, namely – Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Among the duo, Halliburton reported earnings results on July 24 before the market opened while Schlumberger reported on July 21 (read: 7 ETF Areas to Hog the Limelight in 2017).Results in DetailHalliburton – the second largest oil service company – beat on both lines. Its adjusted income per share from continuing operations (excluding special items) came in at $0.23, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19. Continued and effective cost management led to the outperformance. Halliburton posted revenues of $4.957 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.856 billion.Schlumberger – the world’s largest oilfield services provider – came up upbeat Q2 results. Earnings of $0.35 per share (excluding charges and credits) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.30 and the year-ago figure of $0.23. Total revenue of $7.462 billion improved from the year-ago level of $7.164 billion but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.227 billion.Market ImpactThe space got mixed signals thanks to decent performances by industry bellwethers were outweighed by long-standing oil price worries. We would like to note that in the OPEC and non-OPEC meeting held this week, Saudi Arabia announced its plans to take further action to boost waning oil prices. The Saudi oil minister also noted that the country’s oil exports would be fixed to 6.6 million bpd, which reflects a decline of almost a million bpd from last year’s export level. With this, things might turn positive in the days to come, though we believe it is likely to take time.Still, investors might want to know the impact on ETFs that are heavily invested in these popular oil service companies. Below we highlight three oil-services ETFs with considerable allocation to SLB and HAL that could be in focus following oil-service earnings (see all energy ETFs here):iShares US Oil Equipment & Services ETF (IEZ  -  Free Report) This ETF invests about $195.3 million of assets in 35 securities, focusing solely on the energy world. The in-focus SLB takes up the first position here with 15.87% of holdings. Generally, when one stock accounts for as much as 20% of an ETF's weight, its individual performance decides much of the fund’s price movement. HAL takes up the second position with about 9.89% of total assets (read: Oil Refiner ETF (CRAK): A Star Pick Amid Weak Oil Price).VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH  -  Free Report) OIH invests $1.0 billion of assets in 26 holdings and devotes as much as 19.54% of the portfolio weight to SLB, followed by 14.70% in HAL.Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE  -  Free Report) XLE invests $15.4 billion of assets in 36 stocks. The fund puts 7.51% of the portfolio weight in SLB, followed by 3.09% in HAL.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

1523,HAL,"Shares of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) rose nearly 3% in pre-market trade, after the oilfield services behemoth reported better-than-expected second quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.Halliburton’s adjusted income per share from continuing operation (excluding special items) came in at 23 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents – the twelfth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $4,957 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,844 million.Oil services companies (like Halliburton) – providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells – are generally the first of the U.S. energy firms to kick off an earnings season. While the world’s biggest oilfield services company Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) came out with Jun numbers on Friday, Jul 21, the remaining two of the so-called Big Four oilfield service and equipment providers – Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) – report second quarter earnings over the next few days.Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteNorth American Market Continues to Gather StrengthAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pimping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one year since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by nearly 25% sequentially, ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 21%Additionally, the international market seems to have bottomed out, with regional sales rising 7% from the first quarter on heightened Latin American activity, together with increased well completion and drilling services in Europe and Africa. However, pricing pressure continued with the slowdown in Middle East stimulation services. Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $397 million, turning around from the year-ago loss of $32 million and the previous quarter’s income of $147 million, helped by strong pressure pumping activity and improved pricing in the U.S. land market.But Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation unit profit dropped – from $154 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $125 million this year and was only marginally ahead of the $122 million earned in the Mar quarter. The setback was on account of pricing pressure, partly offset by higher drilling activity in Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, a seasonal rebound in the North Sea and Russia, plus increased fluid services in Asia Pacific.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the second quarter was $327 million.As of Jun 31, 2017, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had approximately $2,139 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,816 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 54.7%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stock PerformanceHalliburton has seen its shares fall 18.0% year to date after gaining more than 50% for 2016. Nevertheless, the company has managed to outperform the industry across the past six months- and 1-year periods.Let’s wait and see if the latest earnings beat can help the stock break out of sluggishness.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Notably, total count increased 11 times in the last 12 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 916.   For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1039, marginally higher than 1036. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 19, in line with the count for the week ended May 25.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, however, came lower than four for the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 861, up from 859 for the week ended May 25.

In the Cana Woodford, oil rigs have been increasing for four weeks in a row. Eagle Ford has also been witnessing the same over the past two weeks.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude recently fell marginally below the $65-a-barrel psychological mark as there are possibilities that Saudi Arabia and Russia will decide to relax the production cut quota in the OPEC meeting. However, considering the current crude pricing scenario, there is room for ramping up oil and gas drilling activities. Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Wildhorse Resource Development Corporation (WRD  -  Free Report).

With higher commodity prices supporting the surge in oil production and drilling activity, the company issued an upbeat outlook.The world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) saw its income from continuing operations (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs and charges associated with U.S. tax reform) come in at 53 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents -- the fourteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,940 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,567 million.Strong North America, and Improving International MarketAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing, particularly for pressure pumping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one and half years since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its Completion and Production unit revenue grew 8% sequentially, ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth.Additionally, the outlook for Halliburton’s international market continues to improve. In fact, regional sales were up 11% sequentially in the fourth-quarter, driven by strong activity gains across a number of product services lines in Latin America, as well as increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere.Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteSegmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $552 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $85 million.

1526,HAL,"Equinor ASA (EQNR  -  Free Report) is awarding new contracts for integrated drilling and well services on majority of the Equinor-operated fields on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) to Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHGE  -  Free Report), Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report).The contracts comprise options for five two-year extensions. The extension of the contracts is dependent on constant accomplishment of the goals for well deliveries. Initially, the contracts have been awarded for four years and have a total estimated value of about NOK 30 billion.Equinor’s new contracts will ensure that the service supplier, rig supplier and operator have proper interactions with each other so as to simplify each ones roles and responsibilities.The purpose of this practice is to facilitate flawless planning and execution of operations between various contributors. It will also help in drilling more wells, which will result in recovery improvement and enhance long-term operations.The new contracts are projected to generate employment for about 2000 people on 17 fixed platforms and eight mobile rigs. The current service contracts, which expire on Aug 31, 2018, will be substituted with the new ones.The contracts incorporate new methods of joint operations, which will provide the service suppliers with larger accountability for services than before. For successful implementation of integrated operations, support from land will be vital. For mobile units the service contracts will be connected to the rig rather than various licenses. The collaboration model has given very competent and efficient results. It has already been tested out for Johan Sverdrup Phase 1, Aasta Hansteen, Mariner and the Askeladd and Askepott Cat J rigs.The contracts will comprise integrated drilling, cementation and pumping, drilling and completion fluids, electrical logging and completion services for well construction.Per Baker Hughes, it will be the key drilling and well services provider for the eight rigs developing Troll, Oseberg and Grane. These three fields are considered to be the most prolific and dynamic in the Norwegian continental shelf.In a separate announcement, Equinor announced that it had been awarded seven licenses in the 24th licensing round by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. Of which, Equinor will operate five and will have partner positions in the other two.The company aims to maintain production on the NCS until 2030 and beyond at the current level. For this, the company is required to get access to new exploration acreage past the already-opened areas.Thus, the award is in line with Equinor’s exploration strategy of securing access to newer areas on the Norwegian continental shelf as exploration in the region gets more challenging.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, Equinor’s shares have gained 16.8% compared with the industry’s 8.6% rise.Zacks Rank Equinor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1527,HAL,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes reported an increase in rig count in the United States.Rig Count DetailsBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1059 in the week (ended May 25) compared with the prior week’s 1046. Notably, total count increased 13 times in the last 14 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 908.  For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1036, higher than 1023. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended May 18. The tally for offshore rigs was 19, also in line.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 859, up from 844 for the week ended May 18. Notably, for the first time since the week through Feb 9, the market witnessed such a jump in weekly rig count.Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 722. The oil rig count rose 11 times in the last 14 weeks.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 198 is lower than 200 for the week ended May 18. However, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 185.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 66 units increased from 61 units. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by eight units to 993 units.    Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 15 rigs were oil-directed — same as the tally for the week ended May 18.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of 10 oil rigs in the Permian Basin. With this, rigs exploring oil in the region increased for four weeks in a row. It seems that drillers have been gathering in Permian despite the basin suffering from midstream infrastructure bottleneck.The leading crude producers in the world — Saudi Arabia and Russia —  were in talks to boost daily oil production by roughly 1 million barrels, per media reports. This created a panic in the energy market, leading crude prices to fall below $70 a barrel through the week ended May 25.However, the oil drilling market scenario is still favorable in U.S. shale plays. Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report) and Comstock Resources, Inc. (CRK  -  Free Report).

1528,HAL,"Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) recently inked the unconventional gas stimulation services three-year contract with Saudi Aramco, in a bid to unleash a natural gas revolution in Saudi Arabia. Per the deal, the oilfield services major will provide project management, hydraulic fracturing and well intervention services to meet Saudi Aramco’s production targets and improve the economics of its unconventional resources program. The program mainly covers three regions, namely Northern Kingdom, South Ghawar and Jafurah Basin.Deal BenefitsWhile Halliburton has been a major player in the U.S. shale drilling across Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana, the company has also successfully expanded its operations in Argentina, Poland, Canada, Mexico, among others. On entering into a three-year contract in Saudi Arabia, the company has further expanded its geographical footprint, along with boosting its backlog and revenue prospects.Though Saudi Aramco is the world’s top exporter of oil, Saudi Arabia also has a huge natural gas potential, holding the world’s fifth-largest gas reserves. By 2026, the government aims to produce some 651 billion cubic meters of natural gas per day -- almost double its current output. However, much of it is difficult to recover from shale rock and tight sand. Hence, the company intends to utilize Halliburton’s specialized technological services to tap into those resources.The contract will boost Saudi Aramco’s efforts to spur natural gas production for meeting the domestic needs as well as shoring up its evolving chemical industry, by providing the essential raw materials. The state-run company also intends to reduce its practice of burning oil for domestic power, thus freeing up more barrels for exports. Notably, over the past year, Saudi Aramco has awarded $4.5 billion worth contracts to international oil service companies, for increasing the country’s gas output.The deal is also in sync with Saudi Arabia’s reform program “Vision 3030,” which has the goal of making its economy less reliant on oil prices. Under the reform plan, the country aims to fuel economic modernization and foreign investment. Saudi Aramco’s plans for IPO are also part of its Vision 3030, as the company intends to diversify globally.While the IPO offering plans have made a slow progress, the company is getting more involved with downstream efforts and aiming to maximize its value by making investments in refineries and chemical plants. Saudi Arabia is taking a keen interest in investing in Texas petrochemical plants, and the refineries in Corpus Christi and Port Arthur. In fact, it is planning to invest $18 billion in its U.S. subsidiary, Motiva Enterprises LLC's Port Arthur refinery that has a processing capacity of 603,000 barrels of crude per day.Middle East Shale Drilling Picks UpAlthough shale drilling in North America has been on a roll, doubling its production and making it a major hydrocarbon exporter, the shale revolution is still limited to a few countries. However, the interest in shale drilling has been on a gradual rise in the Middle East and North Africa lately.Last month, Bahrain discovered extensive oil and gas resources off its west coast and also inked a deal with Halliburton to commence the drilling of two appraisal wells, and further evaluate the potential of the reservoir. Recently, there were also reports about Algeria’s state energy firm Sonatrach seeking collaboration with Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) to develop the country’s shale gas. While the details of the latest Halliburton-Aramco contract are not disclosed, it aims to unlock the natural gas boom in Saudi Arabia.Zacks Rank and Key PicksHalliburton currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Halliburton Company Price Halliburton Company Price | Halliburton Company QuoteSome better-ranked players within the same industry include Nine Energy Service, Inc. (NINE  -  Free Report) and Select Energy Services, Inc. (WTTR  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1529,HAL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HAL due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsHalliburton reported in-line first quarter profit after robust North American drilling activity on the back of oil pricing strength were offset by problems in Venezuela and frack sand delivery delays.The company's income from continuing operations (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs) came in at 41 cents per share, same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, revenues of $5,740 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,760 million.However, Halliburton joined fellow oil services majors Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, a GE Company, in affirming increased activity in U.S. shale, driven by strong oil and gas production in response to an improving crude environment.Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $500 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $147 million. The division’s performance was helped by continued growth in the North American land drilling business. Further, Halliburton experienced a bump in the Europe/Africa/CIS completion services, while stimulation activity in the Middle East were higher as well.However, the segment operating income could not match our consensus estimate of $534 million. The shortfall could be attributed to cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing. Rising prices of sand – used to hydraulically fracture new wells – increased the expense associated with the drilling of a new shale well and put upward pressure on the cost of contractors like Halliburton.As it is, Halliburton had to shell out more to purchase the sand from spot markets to minimize the impact on client completion timelines after extreme weather and rail shut-downs disrupted deliveries.Meanwhile, Drilling and Evaluation unit profit improved from $122 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $188 million this year. The outperformance was on account of higher drilling activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and North America.But the segment income was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $180 million. Results were hampered by lower activity – primarily across various product lines – in Latin America, especially Venezuela.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the first quarter was $501 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had approximately $2,332 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,428 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.4%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.VGM ScoresAt this time, HAL has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D. The stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, HAL has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1532,HAL,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued at the end of every week since 1944, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 1045 in the week (ended May 11), up from prior week’s 1032. Notably, total count increased 10 times in the last 11 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 885.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore and offshore operations. The tally for offshore rigs was recorded at 21 compared with 19 for the week ended May 4. Also, the number of onshore rigs totaled 1021, up from 1011.  Three rigs operated in the inland waters last week, marginally higher than two in the week ended May 4.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose to 844 from 834 for the week ended May 4. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 712. The oil rig count rose ninth time in the last 11 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 199 is higher than 196 for the week ended May 4.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 172.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 55 units is in line with the figure reported in the week ended May 4. The horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) rose by 13 units to 990 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 20 units — 19 rigs were oil-directed — higher than the tally of 19 for the week ended May 4.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of eight onshore rigs in Texas. The addition of three onshore rigs to each of Colorado and Oklahoma states also aided the rise.    The West Texas Intermediate crude recently reached its highest point since November 2014, hitting $71.36 a barrel after President Trump’s announcement that the United States will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. Hence, the rally in crude has been highly supportive for drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc.

1533,HAL,"It was a week where oil prices marked its highest finish in three-and-a-half years.On the news front, oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the first-quarter energy earnings season. Both companies, apart from coming out with estimate-meeting numbers, indicated that the North American drilling market remains robust, driven by increased activity. Meanwhile, French oil giant TOTAL S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report) agreed to acquire French utility Direct Energie for $1.73 billion.Overall, it was another good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained around 1.5% to close at $68.38 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged up a marginal 0.2% to $2.739 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: CVX's Gorgon Expansion, MDR & NOV's Operational Updates & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recovered from President Trump’s tweet, posting a second straight weekly gain following bullish EIA crude inventory numbers and expectations that the OPEC-led group of exporters will continue with their supply cuts.The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories were down by 1.1 million barrels for the week ended Apr 13. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go up some 625,000 barrels. Oil stockpiles have actually shrunk in 38 of the last 54 weeks and are down more than 105 million barrels in the past year – a pointer to a tightening oil market.The commodity was also supported by reports that the OPEC-Russian alliance would like production withholding pact to run beyond the scheduled closure at the end of 2018.Natural gas prices also inched up northward last week following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. Investors were encouraged by another unseasonal inventory drawdown that further pushed back the commencement of the injection season.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of 38 cents per share (eliminating charges and credits) - in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line rose from the year-earlier figure of 25 cents.Surge in North American directional land drilling operations and awards for Integrated Production Services (IPS) contracts supported the first-quarter results. This was offset partially by operations related to Testing Services in Qatar, Egypt and Brazil.As of Mar 31, 2018, Schlumberger had approximately $4,165 million in cash and short-term investments and $13,526 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32.7%. In the January-to-March quarter, the company bought back 1.4 million shares.For 2018, the company projects investments of $2 billion, almost in line with the 2017 and 2016 figures. (Read more: Schlumberger Q1 Earnings Meet, Investment Plan in Place)2.    Smaller rival Halliburton reported in-line first quarter profit after robust North American drilling activity on the back of oil pricing strength were offset by problems in Venezuela and frack sand delivery delays. Halliburton’s income from continuing operations (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs) came in at 41 cents per share, same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, revenues of $5,740 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,760 million.However, Halliburton joined Schlumberger in affirming increased activity in U.S. shale, driven by strong oil and gas production in response to an improving crude environment.Halliburton’s capital expenditure in the first quarter was $501 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had approximately $2,332 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,428 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.4%. (Read more: Halliburton's Earnings Streak Comes to a Halt in Q1)3.    TOTAL S.A. announced that it has entered into a definite agreement with the controlling shareholders of Direct Energie to acquire 74.33% of its share capital. Price of each share is fixed at €42 ($51.96) and ex-dividend at €0.35 (43.3 cents) per share, representing an aggregate acquisition price of approximately €1.4 billion ($1.73 billion).The acquisition of majority of Direct Energie’s interest will help TOTAL to expand its electric and gas generation, and distribution operation in France and Belgium. TOTAL aims to develop energy from alternate and clean sources like natural gas. Direct Energie’s acquisition will support the long-term plan of TOTAL, as it will bring in 1.35-gigawatt (GW) of installed capacity and supplement Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) TOTAL’s 900 megawatt (MW) installed capacity. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.TOTAL also aims to have a global capacity of at least 10 GW of installed clean power generation within five years. The acquisition of Direct Energie will add 1.35 GW of clean energy generation capacity to TOTAL’s production portfolio. TOTAL has a few more renewable projects under construction, which when completed will help the company reach its renewable goals.

The company’s financial restructuring plan received approval from 99.8% of the creditors and has also been officially confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The company now expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in two to three months.Per the restructuring agreement, the international offshore drilling company will witness capital injection of $1.08 billion that would comprise $880 million secured loans and $200 million equity.However, shareholders will be receiving a minimal recovery from their existing shares. Existing shareholders will receive only 1.9% stake in the post restructuring equity. (Read more: SeaDrill's Shares Ride High on Confirmed Restructuring Plans)5.    McDermott International, Inc. (MDR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will combine its operations with that of Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., which is expected to close in May 2018. The news came following a dramatic chain of events wherein McDermott was approached by Norway-based offshore oil services provider Subsea 7 S.A. with an unsolicited, non-binding buyout proposal that was subject to the termination of the agreed-upon Chicago Bridge & Iron deal.Subsea 7 was interested in acquiring McDermott as it would have made the combined company the leader in subsea equipment industry, with significant expansion in market share.  McDermott's board believed that the bid from Subsea 7 was undervalued. McDermott recently provided encouraging first-quarter 2018 operational update, while reaffirming its strong guidance for the whole year. Moreover, with a strong balance sheet, the company is well positioned to benefit from the deal with Chicago Bridge & Iron in the long term. Thus, McDermott ruled in favor of the $6 billion Chicago Bridge & Iron deal struck in December.( Read more: McDermott Sticks to CBI Brushing Aside Subsea 7, Stock Jumps)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM+1.5%-4.7%CVX+2%+3.7%COP+1.4%+31.1%OXY+3.9%+17.4%SLB+1.9%+8.6%RIG+6.5%+22.8%VLO+6.6%+40.6%ANDV+6.6%+12%Reflecting the bullish oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a +2.6% return last week.

1534,HAL,"After a prolonged period of 10-year bond yields relatively stagnant in the 2.8s earlier this year — while equity markets were setting a wild roller coaster in motion — we now see the 10-year peek its head up near 3% for the first time since the end of 2013. At 2.966%, market participants are beginning to pay close attention here, with a ratcheted-up bond yield signifying things like increased economic inflation, which would likely prompt the Fed to raise interest rates higher, faster.Also of interest, not of actual concern just yet, to the market is the tight spread between the 10-year bond yield and the 2-year, which is currently the lowest it’s been since 2007 — which is an important benchmark historically, as it came the year Bear Stearns crumbled and ahead of the economic meltdown of 2008 which led to the Great Recession.

1536,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig count in the United States.Details on Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 936 in the week ended Jan 19 — lower than the prior week’s 939. This marked a decrease in rig count for three times in the last four weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 694.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 916, lower than 919. The tally for offshore and inland waters were 19 and 1, in line with the respective counts for the week ended Jan 12. Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 slipped from 752 recorded for the week ended Jan 12. This marked a decline after the domestic plays witnessed the addition of 10 rigs through the week ended on Jan 12.However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 551.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 189 was up from 187 for the week ended Jan 12. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 142.   Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 57 units fell from the count of 62 for the week ended Jan 12. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by two units to 879.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Jan 12.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil decreased while the count for natural gas increased. Overall, the total tally of rigs in the United States declined, thanks to the removal of the respective four and three rigs from the Utica and Eagle Ford shale plays. In the Utica resources, natural gas rig count fell from 27 to 24, while the tally for oil rig was zero against 1 in the week ended Jan 12. At the Eagle Ford shale, the count of rigs exploring crude fell from 62 to 58.On top of that, two rigs were removed from each of DJ-Niobrara basin, Cana Woodford shale and Barnett shale play.Although the count of oil rigs fell, there has been plenty of room for crude explorers to ramp up drilling, given that the commodity has been trading above the $60-per-barrel mark.  Energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.   Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities. We expect the company to see year-over-year earnings growth of more than 357% in 2017.Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources is also an upstream energy player. The company is likely to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 157.1% in 2017.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1539,HAL,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2018 results on Monday, Apr 23, before market opens. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 41 cents on revenues of $5,760 million.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.2% thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales.On a further encouraging note, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014, as you can see in the chart below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteEven pricewise, the stock has done better than the peer group so far this year; it is up 4.5% in 2018 as against 0.2% loss for the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry. Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells surpasses earnings estimate this time too.Unfortunately, as per our model, the trend is likely to be broken in the first quarter. Evidently, multiple headwinds including fracking sand logistics issues have dampened expectations.Thus, while U.S. activity continues to accelerate and margins remain strong, Halliburton’s underlying results are unlikely to come ahead of our expectations. The tepid sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the estimate revision trend has been negative with four downward estimate revisions and none up in the last month.Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Halliburton’s third-quarter results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWith U.S. rig count falling to record levels in 2016, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds. However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend.The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, the first quarter of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014.Consequently, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the oilfield service providers. In particular, the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing -- particularly for pressure pumping.As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $3,822 million, higher than $3,804 million reported in the previous quarter and way above the first-quarter 2017 sales of $2,604 million. To put things in perspective, the Completion and Production unit makes up around two-thirds of the oilfield service provider’s total revenue and operating income.However, cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing is likely to drag down the company's bottom line. Rising prices of sand – used to hydraulically fracture new wells – increases the expense associated with the drilling of a new shale well and puts upward pressure on the cost of contractors like Halliburton.As it is, Halliburton had to shell out more to purchase the sand from spot markets to minimize the impact on client completion timelines after extreme weather and rail shut-downs disrupted deliveries.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.42%.Zacks Rank: Halliburton is #3 Ranked.

1540,HAL,"It was a week where the price of oil finished lower and natural gas futures also pulled back from their highest levels since May.On the news front, oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the fourth-quarter energy earnings season. Importantly, both companies, apart from coming out with estimate beating numbers, indicated that activity in North America remain strong even as the international market continues to improve. Meanwhile, British oil giant BP plc (BP  -  Free Report) saw its Deepwater Horizon costs spill over $65 billion following a new, $1.7 billion charge in the fourth-quarter.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1.5% to close at $63.37 per barrel, while natural gas prices edged down 0.5% to $3.185 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Shell's Acquisition, Apache & Encana's Production Guidance & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its first weekly decline in a month. The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. U.S. output rose by 258,000 barrels per day last week to 9.75 million barrels per day, tantalizingly close to December’s record of 9.789 million barrels per day -- the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In fact, the Energy Department believes that U.S. output will break through the 10 million barrels per day barrier soon, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies.The negative sentiment was partially offset by another higher-than-expected weekly draw. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 33 of the last 41 weeks and are down more than 120 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 412.7 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – settled lower following a smaller-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 183 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also below the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 203 Bcf for the reported week, pointing to tepid demand for the heating fuel.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of 48 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents and the year-ago figure of 27 cents.Surge in SIS software sales, ramp up of drilling operations in Colombia and Argentina along with higher pricing in North America’s onshore market supported the strong fourth-quarter results.On a further positive note, Schlumberger issued a positive outlook for 2018. The company, which plans to exit its marine and land seismic acquisition services, believes that the positive oil market sentiment will push up North American investment by upstream operators. Meanwhile, the international market is expected to witness 5% higher spending in 2018 following three years of decline.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $5,089 million in cash and short-term investments and $14,875 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32.8%. In the October-to-December quarter, Schlumberger bought back 1.6 million shares. (Read more Schlumberger's Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates, Up Y/Y)2.    Smaller rival Halliburton reported better-than-expected fourth quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America -- the company’s largest market by sales. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs and charges associated with U.S. tax reform) came in at 53 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents – the fourteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,940 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,567 million.Along the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing, particularly for pressure pumping.Additionally, the outlook for Halliburton’s international market continues to improve. In fact, regional sales were up 11% sequentially in the fourth-quarter on the back of strong activity gains across a number of product services lines in Latin America, as well as increases in drilling and stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere.Halliburton’s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was $439 million. For the full year, capital spending was $1,373 million. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had approximately $2,337 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,430 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.5%. (Read more Halliburton Shares Leap After Q4 Earnings, Sales Beat)3.    BP is likely to pay additional charge of about $1.7 billion in fourth-quarter 2017 relating to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (""DWH"") spill. The Court Supervised Settlement Program (""CSSP""), which was established post the DWH, has ordered BP to pay a post-tax non-operating charge of about $1.7 billion for the remaining Business Economic Loss (""BEL"") and other claims related with the CSSP. The payment will be carried out over a multi-year period.The high claims determined by the CSSP along with the effect of the Fifth Circuit’s adverse May 2017 ruling on the matching of revenues with expenses while appraising BEL claims has resulted in this charge.The claims are about seven times higher than the company’s expectations. By the end of September 2017, BP paid about $63.4 billion to cover clean-up costs and legal fees connected to the largest environmental disaster in the U.S. history where 11 rig workers were killed. Moreover, hundreds of outstanding claims have yet to be closed. (Read more: BP to Cough Up Additional $1.7B in Charges for 2010 Oil Spill)4.    Pipeline operator, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its compression units, CDM Resource Management and CDM Environmental & Technical Services LLC, to natural gas compression services provider, USA Compression Partners, LP for about $1.8 billion.Per the deal, USA Compression will pay $1.225 billion in cash along with 19.2 million of its common units and 6.4 million of its Class B units to Energy Transfer Partners. However, there won’t be any quarterly distributions for the Class B units in the first year following the closure of the transaction, which is expected by the first half of 2018.The deal is expected to strengthen Energy Transfer Partners' balance sheet by lowering its debt burden. As of Sep 30, 2017, the partnership had long-term debt (less current maturities) of $33,630 million. Debt-to-capitalization ratio was about 52.2%. Apart from reducing the debt load, the cash proceeds of $1.225 billion can also be used for funding new projects. The move also reduces the chance of the partnership slashing its distribution – currently yielding an attractive 11.3% – in the coming quarters. (Read more Energy Transfer Partners Divests Compression Units for $1.8B)5.    Moving forward with its $30-billion divestment goal, Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) is set to offload West Qurna 1 oil field in Iraq to Japan's Itochu Corporation. However, the value of the transaction has been kept under wraps.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company also intends to close the divestment of its interest in the Majnoon oil field in Iraq to the state-run Basra Oil Company by June 2018. Production in the Majnoon oil field started in 2014, with average capacity of 210,000 barrels per day. It is to be noted, Shell has a 45% operating stake in the Majnoon oil field. Malaysian national petroleum company, Petronas and Iraq’s Missan Oil Company have 30% and 25% stakes in the field, respectively.The primary reason behind Shell leaving Majnoon is that the oil department of the country and the company could not agree on the future production plans and investments for the field. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The divestment is in line with Shell's strategy to steer clear of debt stemming from its $50-billion acquisition of BG Group. The move will also help the company to upgrade and streamline its portfolio.

1543,HAL,"With reports from 32.8% of the S&P 500 companies out, we are in the thick of Q3 earnings. Meanwhile, only 19.4% of the energy companies belonging to the index have reported their Q3 numbers. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these energy firms are up 253.9% from the same period last year on 33.5% higher revenues; 50% of the companies have reported positive earnings surprises so far; with 50% beating revenue estimates.Moreover, our report shows that energy is the only sector among the 16 representing the S&P 500 index to witness triple-digit earnings growth in Q3.Hence, it is time for investors to add energy stocks with strong growth potential to their portfolio.Crude Turns Around in Q3As per macrotrends, The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude saw a 12.2% gain during the third quarter of 2017 after two consecutive quarters of decline this year. Notably, this is the highest quarterly gain since the April-to-June quarter of 2016.According to The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), average monthly prices for each month of Q3 2017 were higher than the year-ago comparable period. Lower global crude inventory helped ease the crude supply glut concern which primarily supported the oil price rally in the third quarter.Oversupply Concerns Ease in Q3Per the EIA, during the July-to-September quarter of this year, worldwide oil inventories declined by 500,000 barrels per day (B/D). With this, the inventory level fell for three quarters in a row.According to The Oil & Gas Journal, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) produced an average of 32.9 million B/D in the third quarter as compared to last November’s 33.4 million B/D. Thus, it can be safely concluded that the leading crude exporter’s landmark production cut deal primarily supported the draws in global crude inventory.Oil Rebound Drives Performance   Major oilfield service firms have reported healthy Q3 numbers so far. Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved from the year-earlier adjusted figure of 25 cents.Another leading oilfield service player, Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), reported better-than-expected profit in the third quarter. The company’s income from continuing operations came in at 42 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents — the thirteenth consecutive quarter of outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.On top of that, key upstream energy player Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 5 cents per share which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. Notably, the company had incurred a loss of 6 cents in the year-ago quarter.Hence, it is clear that the promising Q3 crude pricing environment supported the top and bottom-line performance of key energy companies.Let’s Focus on Growth Energy StocksSince crude determines the fate of energy companies, the favorable oil price scenario will support Q3 numbers for energy firms that are yet to report results.However, choosing the right stocks is quite an uphill task. With the help of our proprietary screening criteria, we have shortlisted four energy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These stocks have a Growth Style Score of A or B.Growth stocks, as the name suggests, offer higher growth potential to investors compared to other stocks in the same category. A primary attribute of growth stocks is that these prefer to invest profits in capital growth projects to develop products and technologies rather than paying dividends.In particular, our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth. Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B, when combined with a favorable Zacks Rank, offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.Headquartered in Irving, TX, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) is the world’s largest publicly traded oil company. The company, set to report third-quarter results on Oct. 27, has a Growth Style Score of B.Our proven model shows that Exxon Mobil is likely to beat third-quarter earnings because it has an Earnings ESP of +1.91% and a Zacks Rank #2. Our research shows that for stocks with a combination of positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2, or 3 (Hold), the chance of delivering a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.  Also, we expect Exxon Mobil to witness year-over-year earnings growth of almost 39% for the July-to-September quarter.Newpark Resources, Inc. (NR  -  Free Report), based in The Woodlands, TX, is a leading provider of drilling fluids products that are used in oil fields.Scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct. 30, Newpark has an Earnings ESP of +33.33%. The company has a Growth Style Score of B and carries a Zacks Rank #2.The company’s earnings surprise history looks impressive. Newpark managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 70.46%.We also expect the firm to see year-over-year earnings growth of 123.1% in the quarter.Ecopetrol SA (EC  -  Free Report), based in Bogotá, Colombia, operates as an integrated energy player. The company is expected to report quarterly earnings on Nov. 24.The firm has a Growth Style Score of A and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

1544,HAL,"The big name reporting earnings today will be Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), but not until after the closing bell this afternoon. Never fear, though — there are plenty of other firms pushing out Q2 earnings results in the meantime:Oil field services provider Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) posted 23 cents per share on quarterly revenues of $4.96 billion. Both numbers easily topped expectations of 19 cents per share and $4.84 billion in sales. Improved performance in both North and South America were cited as improvements in the company’s Q2, as was operating income in its Completion & Production segment, which swung to $397 million from a loss of $32 million this time a year ago. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is trading up 2.5% in today’s pre-market.Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report) also beat the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines: $2.01 per share and $3.23 billion in revenues outperformed the $1.96 and $3.17 billion expected, respectively. This marks at least the fifth straight positive earnings surprise for the Zacks Rank #3 company, which also bumped up its guidance range for fiscal 2017 by a dime on both top and bottom ends.Toy-making giant Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) reported a mixed Q2 report this morning, beating the bottom-line estimate by 7 cents to 53 cents per share. Quarterly sales, however, narrowly missed the $973 million expected in the Zacks consensus. Yet franchise brand sales were up 21% year over year (these include popular brand names such as Monopoly, Transformers and My Little Pony), on quarterly sales up 10.6%. Shares are selling off roughly 5% in today’s pre-market, however, as the stock is up 40% year to date.Retail brand company VF Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) beat expectations narrowly on top and bottom lines this morning, by a penny on the bottom line to 29 cents per share, and by roughly 3% on the top line to $2.36 billion. Strength in the company’s largest brands — among them Wrangler jeans, The North Face, Timberland and Nautica — boosted the company’s fortunes in the quarter. VF Corp. also announced Executive Chairman Eric Wiseman will be stepping down as of late October, to be replaced by President & CEO Steven Rendle.Finally, a Q2 beat for Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report) in both earnings and sales has come out this morning, reporting a 6-cent beat to 32 cents per share and $3.23 billion topping the $3.18 billion in revenues anticipated. The spin-off from Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report) in Q4 2016 also bumped up its 2017 EPS guidance from $1.15 per share to $1.20. The company appears to be on fairly sound footing considering the shakeup not only regarding the spin-off but the sudden departure of former CEO Klaus Kleinfeld this past spring.

1545,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes reported a decrease in oil and gas rig counts in the United States.    DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 928 in the week ended Oct 13 – lower than the prior week’s 936. This marked a decline in rig count for seven times in the last 10 weeks.   Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 539.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works slipped from 22 to 20, while the tally for onshore activities fell to 907 from 913.However, the tally for inland waters remained the same at one.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count fell by five to 743. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude decreased for five times in the last six weeks. But, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 432.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – declined by two units to 185. However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 105. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 88.5%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.  Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs decreased by two units to 63, while the horizontal rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by six units to 786.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 20 units – 17 of which were oil-directed – lower than the prior count of 22.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States has decreased, thanks to the removal of six rigs from the Eagle Ford shale play. Moreover, the Barnett shale saw the removal of four rigs.Declining rig count, helping reducing crude glut, helped oil price to settle above the $50-per-barrel mark again.  Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio now are Abraxas Petroleum (AXAS) and Cimarex Energy (XEC). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Headquartered in San Antonio, TX, Abraxas Petroleum explores oil and gas resources in the United States.

1546,HAL,"Posting its second annual gain in a row, oil prices closed 2017 up more than 12%. The last week of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since June 2015. The commodity was supported by a variety of catalysts, including positive vibes from the OPEC-led production cut extension, lower inventory overhang and a flat rig count.What’s encouraging is that the price appreciation extends an upbeat tone in crude trade into 2018 following the fourth monthly gain in a row by the futures contracts. To be precise, the commodity rose about 5.3% in December to end the month and year at $60.42 per barrel.5 Reasons for Oil's December SurgeSharp Inventory Drawdowns: Investors have pinned hopes of recovery over the recent U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles – pointing to a slowdown in shale output. The nation's oil stockpiles have shrunk in 30 of the last 38 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April.Production Cut Deal Extension: One of the significant reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared nearly 17% last quarter revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. True to predictions, the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018. The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Drop in OPEC Output: Meanwhile, the producer group pumped 32.5 million barrels daily in November, about 133,500 barrels a day less than their October output and the lowest level since May. The group’s success in capping production has shrunk the huge global stockpiles of oil and supported prices.Steady Rig Count: Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs remaining essentially flat over the past few weeks also helped cement oil’s December gains. An early indicator of future crude volumes, rigs engaged in oil exploration and production in the U.S. totaled 747 for the week ending Dec 29 – down by two from the previous month and importantly, a sign of brake in shale oil production.Other Factors: An explosion at a Libyan crude pipeline and an unplanned shutdown in the North Sea's 450,000 barrels-per-day Forties pipeline, were also price drivers.How to Identify the Outperformers?The strong December rally does not necessarily indicate that all energy scrips would be wise picks. Moreover, with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver attractive returns. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, this is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy.In particular, we have shortlisted 5 companies that have outperformed oil prices over the past 4 weeks, and have a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Finally, the chosen ones have VGM Score less than or equal to B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best upside potential.5 ChoicesStatoil ASA , a #1 Ranked stock, is our first pick. A major international integrated energy company with operations in all major hydrocarbon-producing regions of the world and an upstream focus on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, Stavanger, Norway-based Statoil has a VGM Score of A. Also, shares of the company have gained 10.1% in the past four weeks.Our second choice is Lonestar Resources US Inc. (LONE  -  Free Report) – an oil and gas exploration and production company with primary focus on the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. This Fort Worth, TX-based Zacks Rank #1 stock, sporting a VGM Score of A, has risen 26.5% in past month.Then we have Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report). Headquartered in Minnetonka, MN, Northern Oil and Gas is a non-operator explorer and producer with primary focus on the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana. This Zacks Rank #1 stock, sporting a VGM Score of B, is up 37.3% in the past four weeks.Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) is another company we recommend. Headquartered in Houston, TX, Halliburton is one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy sector. The company carries a Zacks Rank of 2 with a VGM Score of B. Also, shares of Halliburton have gained 16.2% since the start of December.Finally, there is Sanchez Energy Corp. (SN  -  Free Report). Headquartered in Houston, TX, Sanchez Energy is an independent exploration and production company with majority of its properties in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. The Zacks #2 Ranked stock, which has gained 9% in past month, has a VGM Score of A.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1547,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decrease in total rig counts in the United States.  About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 929 in the week ended Dec 29 — lower than the prior week’s 931. This marked a decrease after the tally increased for the week ended Dec 22.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 658.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore and offshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 909, lower than 910. The tally for offshore was 18, down from 19.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended Dec 22.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was in line with the count for the week ended Dec 22. Further, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 525. Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 182 was down from 184 for the week ended Dec 22. This marked a decrease after the tally increased for two consecutive weeks.However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 132.  Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 65 units increased from 64. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) declined by three units to 864.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 14 of which were oil-directed — down from 19 for the week ended Dec 22.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States decreased, while the count of rigs searching for oil remained the same. Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count fell, primarily supported by the removal of two rigs in Williston basin. One rig, exploring natural gas, was also removed from the Haynesville shale play.   Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil crossed the $60-per-barrel mark, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to ramp up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG) and Approach Resources, Inc. (AREX). Northern Oil and Gas sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Approach Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Based in Minnetonka, MN, Northern Oil and Gas is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities. We expect the company to see year-over-year revenue growth of almost 48% in 2017.Headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, Approach Resources explores oil and gas resources in the domestic shale plays. The company is likely to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 67% in 2017.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1548,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE), reported a fall in oil and natural gas rig count in the United States.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 936 in the week ended Oct 6 – lower than the prior week’s 940. This marked a decline in rig count for seven times in the last 10 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 524.For the week in discussion, the decline in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore and inland waters operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works was reported at 22, in line with the earlier week count.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count slipped by two to 748. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude fell four times in the last five weeks. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 428.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – declined by two units to 187. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 94. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 88.4%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.     Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by one unit to 65, but the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) decreased by five units to 871.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 22 units – 18 of which were oil-directed – same as the prior count.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States has declined, primarily due to the removal of two rigs in each of Marcellus shale play, Permian basin and Cana Woodford shale formation. This signifies that shale drillers are not rushing to the U.S oil resources in the wake of weak commodity prices.           Oil is again trading below the $50-per-barrel mark on fears of lower oil demand from refiners as Hurricane Nate made landfall along the Gulf coast area.Despite weak crude, some energy explorers look attractive. Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio now are Lonestar Resources US (LONE  -  Free Report) and Diamondback Energy (FANG  -  Free Report). Lonestar sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Diamondback carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, Lonestar explores oil and gas resources in the United States. The company is expected to witness 79.7% year-over-year earnings growth in 2017.Headquartered in Midland, TX, W&T Offshore is primarily involved in the exploration and development of Permian basin oil and natural gas resources.

1549,HAL,"Major oilfield services provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America – the company’s largest market by sales.Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents – the thirteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.Oil services companies (like Halliburton) – providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells – are generally the first of the U.S. energy firms to kick off an earnings season. While two of the world’s biggest oilfield services providers – Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) – came out with September numbers on Friday, Oct 20, Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), another biggie, will report third quarter earnings next week.Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company Quote North American Market BoomingAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pimping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one and half years since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by 14% sequentially, well ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 6%.Additionally, Halliburton’s international market proved resilient in the face of challenging circumstances. The company’s impressive expense management for the last several quarters helped regional sales rising more than 4% from the second quarter.Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $525 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $24 million. The division also improved from previous quarter’s income of $397 million, helped by better utilization and pricing in the North American land market - especially in Halliburton’s pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing product service lines.Meanwhile, Drilling and Evaluationunit profit improved from $151 million in the third quarter of 2016 to $180 million this year. The number was also above the $125 million earned in the June quarter. The outperformance was on account of higher drilling activity in the Middle East, North America and Latin America. This was supported by an expanding Consulting and Project Management product line in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the third quarter was $342 million.As of Sep 30, 2017, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company had approximately $1,898 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,423 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stock PerformanceHalliburton has seen its shares fall 18.9% year to date after gaining more than 50% for 2016. Nevertheless, the company has managed to outperform the industry across the past six months- and 1-year periods.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1552,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in oil rig count in the United States. However, the number of rigs searching for natural gas has declined.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 940 in the week ended Sep 29 – higher than the prior week’s 935. This marked an increase in total rig count after the tally declined six times in the last nine weeks.  Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 522.For the week in discussion, the increase in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works rose from 19 to 22, while the tally for onshore activities jumped to 916 from 913.However, the number of rigs for inland waters fell by one unit to two.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count rose by six to 750. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude increased after falling for three weeks in a row. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 425.    Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – declined by one unit to 189. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 96. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 88.2%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.   Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs decreased by four units to 64, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by nine units to 876.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 22 units – 18 of which were oil-directed – higher than the prior count of 19.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States has decreased, however, the count for oil has increased. Overall total oil and gas rig count has jumped, primarily supported by the addition of four rigs in Utah. Louisiana witnessed two more rigs for upstream operations.  Weak oil prices led the explorers to lower the number of drilling rigs in the domestic crude resources. But after oil crossed the $50-per-barrel mark, the upstream business seemed lucrative and drillers started gathering in crude patches.Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio now are Lonestar Resources US (LONE  -  Free Report) and W&T Offshore, Inc. (WTI  -  Free Report). Lonestar sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while W&T Offshore carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1553,HAL,"Monday, July 24th, 2017The big name reporting earnings today will be Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), but not until after the closing bell this afternoon. Never fear, though — there are plenty of other firms pushing out Q2 earnings results in the meantime:Oil field services provider Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) posted 23 cents per share on quarterly revenues of $4.96 billion. Both numbers easily topped expectations of 19 cents per share and $4.84 billion in sales. Improved performance in both North and South America were cited as improvements in the company’s Q2, as was operating income in its Completion & Production segment, which swung to $397 million from a loss of $32 million this time a year ago. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is trading up 2.5% in today’s pre-market.Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report) also beat the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines: $2.01 per share and $3.23 billion in revenues outperformed the $1.96 and $3.17 billion expected, respectively. This marks at least the fifth straight positive earnings surprise for the Zacks Rank #3 company, which also bumped up its guidance range for fiscal 2017 by a dime on both top and bottom ends.Toy-making giant Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) reported a mixed Q2 report this morning, beating the bottom-line estimate by 7 cents to 53 cents per share. Quarterly sales, however, narrowly missed the $973 million expected in the Zacks consensus. Yet franchise brand sales were up 21% year over year (these include popular brand names such as Monopoly, Transformers and My Little Pony), on quarterly sales up 10.6%. Shares are selling off roughly 5% in today’s pre-market, however, as the stock is up 40% year to date.Retail brand company VF Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) beat expectations narrowly on top and bottom lines this morning, by a penny on the bottom line to 29 cents per share, and by roughly 3% on the top line to $2.36 billion. Strength in the company’s largest brands — among them Wrangler jeans, The North Face, Timberland and Nautica — boosted the company’s fortunes in the quarter. VF Corp. also announced Executive Chairman Eric Wiseman will be stepping down as of late October, to be replaced by President & CEO Steven Rendle.Finally, a Q2 beat for Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report) in both earnings and sales has come out this morning, reporting a 6-cent beat to 32 cents per share and $3.23 billion topping the $3.18 billion in revenues anticipated. The spin-off from Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report) in Q4 2016 also bumped up its 2017 EPS guidance from $1.15 per share to $1.20. The company appears to be on fairly sound footing considering the shakeup not only regarding the spin-off but the sudden departure of former CEO Klaus Kleinfeld this past spring.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1555,HAL,"Oilfield service giant Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 earnings of 35 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents and the year-ago figure of 23 cents.  The company reported total revenue of $7,462 million, which improved from the year-earlier level of $7,164 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,258 million.The strong results were driven by a rebound in drilling activities in Russia and the North Sea. Higher demand for directional drilling techniques, especially in the domestic onshore market, also supported the numbers.Schlumberger is the first among the “Big Four” oilfield service and equipment providers to release its quarterly results. The other players – Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) – will report second-quarter results next week.Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups – Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group – registered a year-over-year increase in revenues.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the international market. Rebound in seasonal works in Russia and the North Sea contributed to growth. Higher demand for directional drilling techniques, especially in the domestic onshore market, also supported the top line. However, the positives were partially negated by reduced operations related to the offshore market in the Gulf of Mexico.Results at the Production Group were positively impacted by higher hydraulic fracturing work in the domestic land market. Pricing recovery in the North American land areas, improved unconventional land works in Argentina along with higher activities in China and Russia were also led to the improvement. Meanwhile, a decrease in production at the SPM Shushufindi development partially offset the positives.The Reservoir Characterization segment was supported by strong contributions from the international market. Surge in sales of WesternGeco multiclient seismic license along with higher contributions from drillstem test operations in the UAE led to better results. Higher wireline revenues from the North Sea and Russia also favored the business unit.  Reservoir Characterization: This group posted revenues of $1,759 million as against $1,586 million in the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax operating income was $299 million, up 12% year over year. Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,107 million rose 4% year over year. Pre-tax operating income was $302 million, up 77% year over year.Production Group: Revenues recorded by this group increased 18% from the year-earlier quarter to $2,496 million.

1557,HAL,"Oilfield service giant Schlumberger Limited’s (SLB  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits) were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom line improved from the year-earlier adjusted figure of 25 cents.The company’s total revenue of $7,905 million improved from the year-earlier level of $7,019 million but failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,910 million.Third-quarter earnings were driven by solid demand for directional drilling in the land market of North America. This was partially offset by major project completions in Mexico and Iraq.Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), have reported third-quarter numbers. The other two players – Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) – belonging to the “Big Four” oilfield service and equipment providers – will likely report results on Oct 23 and Nov 1, respectively.  Segmental PerformanceEach of the groups – Reservoir Characterization, Drilling Group and Production Group – registered a year-over-year increase in revenues.Drilling Group revenues increased primarily on contributions from the North American market. Demand for directional drilling in the continent’s land market remained strong during the quarter. However, the positives were partially negated by the closure of Mexico and Iraq’s major developments – related to integrated drilling services.Results at the Production Group were driven by higher hydraulic fracturing work in the North American land market. Higher operations in the unconventional plays in the Middle East also led to the improvement.The Reservoir Characterization segment was supported by strong contributions from the international market. Surge in activities related to Wireline and Testing & Process in Russia and Norway led to the improvement in results. However, reduction of sales related to multiclient seismic license hurt the business unit.Reservoir Characterization: This group posted revenues of $1,771 million as against $1,667 million in the prior-year quarter. However, pre-tax operating income was $311 million, down 5% year over year.  Drilling Group: Revenues of $2,120 million rose 5% year over year. Pre-tax operating income was $301 million, up 38% year over year.Production Group: Revenues recorded by this group increased 37% from the year-earlier quarter to $2,876 million. Pre-tax operating income skyrocketed 212% year over year to $283 million.Cameron Group: This segment generated revenues of $1,297 million, down 3% year over year. Pre-tax operating income plunged 10% from the prior-year comparable period to $194 million.FinancialsAs of Sep 30, 2017, the company had approximately $4,952 million in cash and short-term investments and $15,871 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 30%. In the July-to-September quarter, the company bought back 1.5 million shares.  Q3 Price Performance  During the third quarter of 2017, Schlumberger has rallied 6%, outperformed the industry’s 1.7% gain.GuidanceFor 2017, the company projects investments of $2.1 billion, lower than the prior projection of $2.2 billion.Key DevelopmentIn a separate announcement, the company declared the execution of an agreement with Cenovus Energy (CVE  -  Free Report).

1558,HAL,"We are entering the heart of the Q3 earnings season, with a host of S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of next week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q3 results from 52 S&P 500 members that combined account for 16.7% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 13.3% from the same period last year on 6.9% higher revenues, with 76.9% positive earnings surprises and 73.1% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have any results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, quite a few companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Q3 Report Card: Oil and Gas Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Moreover, energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year. Also, supply from the 14-member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months, helping to tighten the market significantly. Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended the third quarter at $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude futures hovered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Natural gas fared badly, dropping about 3.5% in the July-September period, thanks to the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages.Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices are in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: As we know, the profitability of energy companies is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Therefore, all oil/gas-related stocks stand to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The April-June 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year -- by far the highest growth among all sectors -- on 16.8% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the Q3 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the third quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom line.In fact, the strongest growth in Q3 is again set to come from the Energy sector. As per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 122% from the third quarter of 2016, while the top line is likely to show an improvement of 16.3% from the year-ago levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 23Let’s see what’s in store for three energy companies expected to come up with September-quarter numbers on Monday, Oct 23.First, we have major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), which is expected to report before the opening bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.In the previous quarter, Halliburton delivered a positive earnings surprise of 21.1%. Moreover, both Halliburton’s segments, Completion and Production as well as Drilling and Evaluation, reported revenues slightly better than our estimates thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.When it comes to earnings surprises, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014. And our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too.For the quarter to be reported, this Houston, TX-headquartered company has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% and a Zacks Rank of 3, the right combination of the two key ingredients.Evidently, multiple tailwinds including the recovery in commodity prices have buoyed the entire space. With U.S. activity accelerating and margins set to remain strong, Halliburton’s underlying results are likely to come ahead of our expectations.As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $3,430 million, much higher than $3,132 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Sales in the Drilling and Evaluation unit is forecasted to be $1,888 million, more than the prior quarter figure of $1,825.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of +0.18% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteHeadquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Core Laboratories N.V. (CLB  -  Free Report) is also set to report third-quarter 2017 results, after the closing bell. The company, which provides reservoir management and production enhancement services to the oil and gas industry on a global basis, has a good track of outperforming estimates in the last two quarters.But our model does not indicate that Core Laboratories is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 44 cents, which is 6 cents (or 15.8%) above from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $161 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 12.6%. However, we notice that the rate of growth may decelerate from the preceding quarter that saw 48.6% jump in the bottom line, while sales were up 10.8%. This could be attributed to the impact of Hurricane Harvey on the company’s Gulf Coast facilities.Core Laboratories N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Core Laboratories N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Core Laboratories N.V. QuoteThen there is Houston, TX-based Superior Energy Services Inc. (SPN  -  Free Report) coming up with July-September operational results Monday evening.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, Superior Energy Services – one of the largest diversified global oilfield service provider, offering drilling, completion and production-related services – has a good history. It went past the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four reports.But our model does not indicate that Superior Energy Services is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -1.14%.With offshore exploration and drilling demand remaining muted, especially in international markets, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Drilling Products & Services adjusted loss is $14.7 million, wider than the $12.4 million loss expected in the second quarter of 2017.Superior Energy Services, Inc.

1559,HAL,"Domestic oil and gas explorer Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Wednesday, Jul 26.In the preceding three-month period, the Denver, CO-based company reported stronger-than-expected results on robust output and cost control.Coming to earnings surprise history, Whiting Petroleum has a mixed record: its missed estimates in 2 of the last four quarters.Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Whiting Petroleum Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider This QuarterOil prices have been on a freefall over the past few weeks, erasing all the gains associated with the OPEC-led output cut. The continued rise in domestic production thanks to soaring shale output have dragged down the commodity well below the psychologically-critical $50 threshold. This will hamper Whiting Petroleum’s earnings and cash flowsHowever, efficiencies on the production front might be able to mitigate some of the damage. The company expects to maintain a flat-to-rising production profile in the upcoming few quarters despite asset sales.Moreover, Whiting Petroleum has been able to reduce costs that will provide some buffer amid the tumbling commodity prices.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Whiting Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -5.26%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 20 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged narrower, at a loss of 19 cents.Zacks Rank: Whiting Petroleum’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP, making us less confident of an earnings surprise call.As it is, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Share Performance: Shares have fallen 41.8% during the second quarter, as against the industry's loss of 16.9%. Over the last 12 months, Whiting Petroleum stock has lost 37.4%.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Whiting Petroleum, here are some energy firms you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:TransCanada Corp. (TRP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.84% and a Zacks Rank #1. The energy infrastructure developer is expected to release earnings results on Jul 28. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.53% and a Zacks Rank #3. The oilfield services provider is anticipated to release earnings on Jul 24.EQT Corp. (EQT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #3. The oil and gas company is likely to release earnings on Jul 27.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1560,HAL,"Pre-market indexes are down slightly to kick off a new week as the U.S. government remains closed for now a third straight day. A Senate meeting today at noon ET will hopefully bring at least a near-term compromise to re-open the government until February 8th, while bigger issues related to immigration policies remain to be hashed out.Furloughs for federal employees are expected, and we will look for clarity on who in the government are considered “essential” federal employees. As it relates to the stock market directly, we will keep an eye on the defense contracting space, which figures to see a negative affect as the government shutdown continues.Thankfully, Q4 earnings results continue unabated this morning, even if your U.S. mail remains delayed. Here are some key results this morning:Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-based Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), a global oilfield services giant based in both Houston, TX and Dubai, U.A.E., reported another bottom-line earnings beat while easily surpassing top-line estimates for its fiscal Q4. Earnings of 53 cents per share outpaced the 46 cents Zacks analysts had been looking for, on $5.94 billion in revenues — much stronger than the consensus estimate of $5.57 billion and the year-ago total of $4.02 billion.Beating earnings expectations is nothing new for Halliburton. In fact, the company has outperformed estimates in its 14th straight quarter this morning. Results were similarly strong for Halliburton’s main competitor, Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), which reported earnings last week. For more info on HAL’s earnings, click here.Swiss banking giant UBS Group (UBS  -  Free Report) also performed well in its Q4, reporting results ahead of today’s opening bell, demonstrating 25% growth in net profit for shareholders, year over year. This comes after a one-time tax write-off that translates to $2.23 billion (U.S.). Full-year net profit reached 23.3%. For more info on UBS’s earnings, click here.After today’s closing bell, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) will be releasing its Q4 results. The streaming content leader is expected to bring in 41 cents per share (42 cents in the Zacks ESP), on $3.28 billion in quarterly revenues. Should these numbers come in as expected, they would represent 173% growth on the bottom line and 32.4% from revenues, year over year.However, Netflix has missed estimates in its last two successive quarters. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also has a negative Zacks Style Score of F (Value: F, Growth: F, Momentum: A). So while the company is expected to post strong growth figures from a year ago, we shall see if they can reach the lofty estimates in the Zacks consensus.

1561,HAL,"It was a week where oil prices slumped below $70-a-barrel. However, natural gas futures edged closer to the psychologically important $3 level.On the news front, energy major Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report) made a significant discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, while natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy, Inc. (LNG  -  Free Report) took the final investment decision to construct a third liquefication unit at its Corpus Christi export terminal in Texas.Overall, it was a mixed week for the sector. While West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 4.9% to close at $67.88 per barrel, natural gas prices rose some 3.2% to $2.939 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: TOTAL's Oman MOU, Rex Energy's Bankruptcy & More)The U.S. oil benchmark posted its first weekly loss in almost a month on fears of supply increase, bearish EIA inventory numbers, and soaring rig count.Oil futures fell after reports emerged that Saudi Arabia and Russia were in discussion to step up output amid reduced supply from Iran and Venezuela.The commodity was also spooked by the federal government’s EIA report that revealed crude stockpiles climbed by 5.8 million barrels, contrary to market expectations for 1.7 million barrels decline. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that U.S. output edged up 2,000 barrels per day last week to nearly 10.73 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs climbing – this time by 15, the most in more than three months – brought further downside.Meanwhile, natural gas prices moved northward last week. Apart from the weekly inventory release showing a smaller-than-expected increase in natural gas supplies, the commodity got a leg up from warm weather forecasts.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Royal Dutch Shell recently discovered a large deepwater well in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM), providing a breather to the offshore oil industry of the United States, which has been gasping for breath since the crude downturn. The Dover well — in the Norphlet geologic play in the U.S. GoM — marks the sixth oil and natural gas find that Shell has struck in the region.The company has been focusing on exploration opportunities in the prolific Norphlet play, which will be moored by its multibillion-dollar offshore project Appomattox, production from which is expected to commence before 2019 end.The Dover well, drilled in Mississippi Canyon about 170 miles offshore southeast of New Orleans, is located in 7,500 feet of water. It was drilled to a depth of 29,000 feet vertically. The prospect lies 13 miles from the Appomattox project that was completed and launched into GoM earlier this month. The new discovery is thus poised for further drilling and development through potential tiebacks to Appomattox rather than building new platforms, which will in turn result in cost savings for the company.Notably, Appomattox is the first major deepwater project authorized by Shell since the oil slump. In fact, since then only two other projects — namely Mad Dog Phase 2 and Vito — have been going forward in the Gulf platforms. (Read more Offshore Industry Gets Respite from Shell's New GoM Find)2.    Cheniere Energy recently gave its final approval regarding the construction of its third liquefaction unit or Train 3 at its Corpus Christi export terminal in Texas. The approval of the project marks the first final investment decision on the new LNG project in the United States since 2015. Building of the third train will be handed over to contractor Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc., which had started with its initial construction in late 2017.Notably, under the Corpus Christi LNG project, the company intends to develop three trains each having a nominal production capacity of 4.5 million metric tons per year of LNG. The first two trains are expected to come online next year.However, the cost and timeline of the third train has not yet been disclosed and its construction is likely to take around four years. Cheniere’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Cheniere Corpus Christi Holdings has credit facilities worth $6.1 billion, which are likely to be utilized to finance a portion of the construction and operation of the trains.Further, Cheniere Energy intends to develop seven midscale liquefaction trains adjacent to the Corpus Christi project. The company has also initiated the regulatory approval process regarding the same. The total production capacities of these trains are expected to be approximately 9.5 million tons per annum. (Read more Cheniere Green Lights Train 3 of Corpus Christi Project)3.    Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) recently inked the unconventional gas stimulation services three-year contract with Saudi Aramco, in a bid to unleash a natural gas revolution in Saudi Arabia. Per the deal, the oilfield services major will provide project management, hydraulic fracturing and well intervention services to meet Saudi Aramco’s production targets and improve the economics of its unconventional resources program. The program mainly covers three regions, namely Northern Kingdom, South Ghawar and Jafurah Basin.Though Saudi Aramco is the world’s top exporter of oil, Saudi Arabia also has a huge natural gas potential, holding the world’s fifth-largest gas reserves. By 2026, the government aims to produce some 651 billion cubic meters of natural gas per day -- almost double its current output.However, much of it is difficult to recover from shale rock and tight sand. Hence, the company intends to utilize Halliburton’s specialized technological services to tap into those resources.The contract will boost Saudi Aramco’s efforts to spur natural gas production for meeting the domestic needs as well as shoring up its evolving chemical industry, by providing the essential raw materials. The state-run company also intends to reduce its practice of burning oil for domestic power, thus freeing up more barrels for exports. Notably, over the past year, Saudi Aramco has awarded $4.5 billion worth contracts to international oil service companies, for increasing the country’s gas output.4.    Cimarex Energy Company (XEC  -  Free Report) has inked a purchase and sale agreement with Callon Petroleum Company to divest oil and gas properties located in Ward County, TX. The sale is expected to raise cash proceeds of about $570 million.Production from these properties, majority of which has been derived from the Bone Spring formation, is about 6,831 barrels of oil equivalent per day (73% oil). Net Wolfcamp acreage of about 18,925 is undeveloped. The transaction is likely to close in the third quarter of 2018.This sale reflects Cimarex Energy’s strategy to consistently upgrade and optimize its portfolio. Cimarex Energy was among the first horizontal operators in the Bone Spring formation in Ward County. The area has delivered good returns over the years. However, the remaining Wolfcamp prospects require more capital compared with other projects. (Read more Cimarex Energy to Divest Ward County Assets for $570M)5.    Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD  -  Free Report) has signed a natural gas liquids (NGL) transportation deal with Apache Corp. (APA  -  Free Report).Per the accord, the Shin Oak pipeline of Enterprise Products will likely be utilized by Apache for carrying NGL from the Alpine High project to the storage facility of the partnership in Mont Belvieu, TX.In the Delaware Basin’s Alpine High discovery, Apache’s presence spreads over 336,000 net acres. The company is willing to transport all produced NGL from the resources through the Shin Oak pipeline. The partnership has committed to transport at least 205,000 barrels of NGL daily through the pipeline.Investors should know that the Shin Oak pipeline, which is being built by Enterprise Products, will spread over roughly 658 miles to the NGL fractionation and storage unit in Mont Belvieu, TX, from Reeves County. The construction of the Shin Oak pipeline will likely close by the second quarter of 2019. Enterprise Products projects the initial daily liquid transportation capacity of the pipeline at 550,000 barrels.The latest transportation commitment will likely provide Enterprise Products with steady fee-based revenues. Apache will also gain as the pipeline will help the company to persistently transport its growing production from the prospective Alpine High prospect.(Read more Enterprise Products, Apache Sign NGL Transportation Accord)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-3.2%-4.3%CVX-4.4%+4.3%COP-5.9%+28.7%OXY-3.5%+17.9%SLB-7.7%+10.4%RIG-10.1%+23.6%VLO-1.5%+42.5%MPC-3.2%+34.3%Reflecting the week’s negative oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a -4.5% return last week.

Notably, total count increased 11 times in the last 12 weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 901.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 1023, marginally higher than 1021. Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than three for the week ended May 11. The tally for offshore rigs was, however, recorded at 19 compared with 21.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was 844, flat with the week ended May 11. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than last year’s 720. The oil rig count rose nine times in the last 12 weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 200 is higher than 199 for the week ended May 11.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs exploring gas is above the year-ago tally of 180.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 61 units increased from 55 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by five units to 985 units.   Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 18 units — 17 rigs were oil-directed — lower than the tally of 20 for the week ended May 11.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring in the United States has increased, courtesy of the addition of three land rigs in New Mexico and two in Texas.           West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude continues to trade above the $70-a-barrel psychological mark owing to concerns that Iran’s crude export might fall after Trump nixed the nuclear deal. Moreover, there is considerable room for rally in oil prices which could support the persistent ramp up in drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report) and Comstock Resources, Inc.

1563,HAL,"Monday, January 22, 2018Pre-market indexes are down slightly to kick off a new week as the U.S. government remains closed for now a third straight day. A Senate meeting today at noon ET will hopefully bring at least a near-term compromise to re-open the government until February 8th, while bigger issues related to immigration policies remain to be hashed out.Furloughs for federal employees are expected, and we will look for clarity on who in the government are considered “essential” federal employees. As it relates to the stock market directly, we will keep an eye on the defense contracting space, which figures to see a negative affect as the government shutdown continues.Thankfully, Q4 earnings results continue unabated this morning, even if your U.S. mail remains delayed. Here are some key results this morning:Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-based Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), a global oilfield services giant based in both Houston, TX and Dubai, U.A.E., reported another bottom-line earnings beat while easily surpassing top-line estimates for its fiscal Q4. Earnings of 53 cents per share outpaced the 46 cents Zacks analysts had been looking for, on $5.94 billion in revenues — much stronger than the consensus estimate of $5.57 billion and the year-ago total of $4.02 billion.Beating earnings expectations is nothing new for Halliburton. In fact, the company has outperformed estimates in its 14th straight quarter this morning. Results were similarly strong for Halliburton’s main competitor, Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), which reported earnings last week. For more info on HAL’s earnings, click here.Swiss banking giant UBS Group (UBS  -  Free Report) also performed well in its Q4, reporting results ahead of today’s opening bell, demonstrating 25% growth in net profit for shareholders, year over year. This comes after a one-time tax write-off that translates to $2.23 billion (U.S.). Full-year net profit reached 23.3%. For more info on UBS’s earnings, click here.After today’s closing bell, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) will be releasing its Q4 results. The streaming content leader is expected to bring in 41 cents per share (42 cents in the Zacks ESP), on $3.28 billion in quarterly revenues. Should these numbers come in as expected, they would represent 173% growth on the bottom line and 32.4% from revenues, year over year.However, Netflix has missed estimates in its last two successive quarters. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also has a negative Zacks Style Score of F (Value: F, Growth: F, Momentum: A). So while the company is expected to post strong growth figures from a year ago, we shall see if they can reach the lofty estimates in the Zacks consensus.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1564,HAL,"Oilfield services behemoth Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) reported in-line first quarter profit after robust North American drilling activity on the back of oil pricing strength were offset by problems in Venezuela and frack sand delivery delays.The world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger’s (SLB  -  Free Report) income from continuing operations (adjusted for Venezuela write-downs) came in at 41 cents per share, same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, revenues of $5,740 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,760 million.However, Halliburton joined fellow oil services majors Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE  -  Free Report), in affirming increased activity in U.S. shale, driven by strong oil and gas production in response to an improving crude environment.Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Halliburton Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteSegmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $500 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $147 million. The division’s performance was helped by continued growth in the North American land drilling business. Further, Halliburton experienced a bump in the Europe/Africa/CIS completion services, while stimulation activity in the Middle East were higher as well.However, the segment operating income could not match our consensus estimate of $534 million. The shortfall could be attributed to cost inflation triggered by increased fracking sand pricing. Rising prices of sand – used to hydraulically fracture new wells – increased the expense associated with the drilling of a new shale well and put upward pressure on the cost of contractors like Halliburton.As it is, Halliburton had to shell out more to purchase the sand from spot markets to minimize the impact on client completion timelines after extreme weather and rail shut-downs disrupted deliveries.Meanwhile, Drilling and Evaluation unit profit improved from $122 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $188 million this year. The outperformance was on account of higher drilling activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and North America.But the segment income was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $180 million. Results were hampered by lower activity – primarily across various product lines – in Latin America, especially Venezuela.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the first quarter was $501 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had approximately $2,332 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,428 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55.4%.Zacks Rank & Stock PicksHalliburton currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that it is expected to perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Meanwhile, one can look at a better-ranked oilfield service player like Flotek Industries, Inc. (FTK  -  Free Report). Flotek Industries is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Flotek Industries provides a range of products and services to enhance returns for the oil and gas finders. The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Houston, TX-based company is 32 cents, representing some 557.1% earnings per share growth over 2017. Next year’s average forecast is $52 cents, pointing to another 62.5% growth.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1566,HAL,"Over the last three years, the energy market has experienced intense price volatility. However, it seems that following an extended period of relative weakness, energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery. With crude now firmly back over $60, the panic that swept over the market are all but gone. The incredible turnaround has stoked high expectations from the energy sector going into the first quarter of 2018.Posting its third quarterly gain in a row, oil prices ended March 2018 up nearly 8% year to date. The commodity got off to a strong start this year with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbing 7.1% in January. Though the benchmark tumbled 4.8% in February in the wake of a broad stock market selloff, it staged a rebound in March, with the contract up 5.6% for the month.The first quarter of the year saw U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014 despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by a variety of catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curbs from OPEC and its allies.What’s encouraging is that the quarterly price appreciation extends an upbeat tone in crude trade into 2018 following the futures contracts’ back-to-back yearly increases. To be precise, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.94 per barrel.A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $50 per barrel mark.Gains Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q4 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The October-December period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 153.7% jump from the same period last year – the most among all 16 broad Zacks sectors by a long way – on 23.6% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q1 earnings season as well, which is on track to be the fourth successive quarter of positive earnings growth for the Oil/Energy sector. This is not surprising, considering that crude prices improved considerably from the year-ago period. In fact, the strongest growth in Q1 is again set to come from Oil/Energy. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the bottom line for energy companies is expected to expand at a highly impressive rate of 60.2% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 15.6%.Not all Stocks Will Outperform EstimatesSure, investing in companies that positively surprises estimates can fetch handsome returns for investors. This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat.But, the flip side, not all energy companies will deliver positive earnings surprises despite the promising backdrop. And when a stock negatively surprises and its scrip plummets subsequently, it can destroy a trade, set back an entire portfolio, and make a trader lose his confidence. Few things can decimate a stock like a negative earnings surprise.Utilizing Zacks' Earnings ESP system can greatly increase your odds of finding these potential underperformers before they report. And excluding these stocks from one’s portfolio can actually increase return by minimizing losses. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Apart from Earnings ESP, we have relied on our proprietary Zacks Rank and Style Score systems to help you avoid a few oil and gas companies this earnings season. Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) along with a VGM Score of D or lower are best avoided.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.As per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of 1, 2 or 3 to beat estimates.

1567,HAL,"In its weekly release, Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report), a GE company, reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in this Houston-based oilfield services player’s rotary rig count impacts demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 990 in the week (ended Mar 16) — higher than the prior week’s 984. Notably, the total count increased for the fifth time in the prior seven weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 789.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs totaled 973, higher than 967.Four rigs operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended Mar 9. The tally for offshore rigs was also in line at 13.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 800 was up from 796 for the week ended Mar 9. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly higher than the previous year’s count of 631. The tally for oil rigs increased five times in the last six weeks.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 189 was up from 188 for the week ended Mar 9. With this, the tally increased five times in the last six weeks.Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 157.Per the recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 88.2% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 57 units decreased from 61 units. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 10 units to 933 units.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 13 units — 12 of which were oil-directed — in line with the tally for the week ended Mar 9.ConclusionThe number of total rigs exploring oil and gas in the United States increased, courtesy of the addition of four and three onshore rigs in Oklahoma  and North Dakota respectively. Two onshore rigs were also added in Texas.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil has been trading mostly over the $60-per-barrel mark since January, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to continue ramping up drilling activities.  Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Continental Resources, Inc.

1569,HAL,"In a bid to revive its sagging fortunes, railroad operator Canadian National Railway Company (CNI  -  Free Report) announced a change at its helm. Per the company, Jean-Jacques Ruest  has replaced Luc Jobin as the chief executive officer (CEO)  effective immediately. Notably, Jobin served as the company's CEO since July 2016.Ruest has also been appointed as the president of the company. Prior to this latest announcement, Ruest served the company as its executive vice-president and chief marketing officer for eight years. In fact, he has been associated with Canadian National for 22 years now. A search for a permanent CEO at Canadian National is underway. What Prompted the Change?Of late, Canadian National has been struggling due to various headwinds. This is quite evident from its lackluster price performance. In the past six months, the stock has lost 8.2% of its value against the industry’s gain of 8.9%.This Montreal, Canada-based company has been facing a number of challenges related to network congestion recently, which have hurt its operational performances. Unless resolved quickly, these operational issues might adversely impact its customer base, thus affecting company’s growth prospects. Increasing costs and the company’s high debt levels raise further concerns.In fact, the above issues are well-reflected in Canadian National’s lower-than-expected earnings per share in the last two quarters. In February 2018, oilfield service major, Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), stated that Canadian National’s service delays were also hurting the bottom line.Given the plethora of issues facing Canadian National, it is not at all surprising that the company has decided to make a change at its helm. However, only time will tell whether the CEO replacement revitalizes the company and yields the desired results.Guidance For 2018 Retained Canadian National still expects adjusted earnings per share for the current year between C$5.25 and C$5.40. Moreover, the company, which focuses on improving safety and efficiency, intends to spend C$3.2 billion under its capital program in 2018.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCanadian National carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1570,HAL,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Halliburtonis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for HAL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 47 cents per share for HAL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for HAL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.46% heading into earnings season.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that HAL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Halliburton, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1571,HAL,"Over the last three years, the energy market has experienced intense price volatility. However, it seems that following an extended period of relative weakness, energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery. With crude now back over $50 and natural gas revolving around the pivot point of $3, the panic that swept over the market are all but gone. The incredible turnaround has stoked high expectations from the energy sector going into the penultimate quarter of 2017.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the third quarter of this year and what makes the Energy sector a material factor this earnings season.Q3 Report Card: Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative.The rapid decline of oil inventories in recent months has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Moreover, energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year. Also, supply from the 14-member OPEC cartel is set to remain constraint for at least the next six months, helping to tighten the market significantly. Adding to the positive momentum, OPEC and Russia claimed to be on the right track in clearing the global oil glut with half the job done.With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended the third quarter at $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $45 per barrel mark.Natural Gas: Natural gas fared badly, dropping about 3.5% in the July-September period, thanks to the fuel’s tepid demand on the back of mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages.Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices are in a sweet spot compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: All oil/gas-related stocks stand to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The April-June period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year – the most among all 16 broad Zacks sectors by a long way – on 16.8% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q3 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas both improved from the year-ago period. In fact, the strongest growth in Q3 is again set to come from the Energy sector. As per our Earnings Preview report, earnings for the sector are expected to be up 122.4% from the third quarter of 2016, while the top-line is likely to show an impressive growth of 17.9%.How to Identify the Outperformers?The encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies likely to beat our third quarter earnings estimates.Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors. This is because a stock generally surges upon earnings beat.But with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, our proprietary methodology - Earnings ESP - makes it relatively simple.

1572,HAL,"Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter results on Jan 17, kicking off the earnings season for the energy space. Now, oil service companies — providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells — are slated to release October-to-December numbers in the coming weeks. These reports are likely to provide a better understanding of the energy sector’s performance this earnings season. In particular, key oil services earnings reports scheduled for release this week and the next are that of Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report).  The world’s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger is expected to report on Jan 19, while smaller rival Halliburton will post its fourth-quarter numbers on Jan 22.Here, we take a closer look at which of these stocks is better placed, although both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The AnalysisWe have assessed the stocks on six parameters.Price PerformanceDuring the fourth-quarter 2017, Halliburton clearly outpaced Schlumberger and the industry in terms of price performance. Halliburton rallied 6.2% against the respective 3.4% and 1.9% declines of Schlumberger and the industry.Free Cash Flow YieldsCompanies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent on the stock.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for Halliburton stands at 3.7%, slightly higher than 3.5% of Schlumberger.Earnings History and ESP  Halliburton has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. The company has consistently surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings since mid-2014. As far as recent history is concerned, the Texas-based firm delivered an earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 41.2%. Meanwhile, Schlumberger has managed to beat earnings in one of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being a modest 4.2%. Considering Earnings ESP as well, Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in this upcoming quarter. This is because the stock has the right combination of two key ingredients — an Earnings ESP of +0.46% and a Zacks Rank #3.The picture is different for Schlumberger as the stock has an Earnings ESP of -1.87%.Earnings Expectations for 2018The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s 2018 earnings currently stands at $2.19 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 89.1%.For Schlumberger, the same is pegged lower at $2.15 per share, reflecting growth of 47.4%.ValuationHalliburton and Schlumberger are overvalued when compared to the Zacks Oil & Gas–Field Services industry. For this, we have employed the EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio, which is often used to value oil and gas stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses.  With an EV/EBITDA ratio of 18.37, Halliburton is overvalued compared to the industry’s 10.57, though Schlumberger also looks pricey compared to the industry; its EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.98 lends it an advantage over Halliburton.   Dividend Yield & Debt BurdenSchlumberger’s current dividend yield of 2.6% is significantly higher than 1.4% of Halliburton. Also, over the past year, the dividend yield of Schlumberger has been consistently higher than Halliburton.Schlumberger has a lower leverage as evident by its debt-to-capital ratio of 28.4% compared with Halliburton’s 55.6%.Bottom LineHalliburton clearly scores higher in terms of share price movement, earnings surprise history and free cash flow yield. On top of that, the company has a much higher ESP reading of +0.46% as against Schlumberger’s -1.87%.However, Schlumberger holds an advantage when it comes to dividend yield and valuation. The stock also has less exposure to debt.Overall, our comparative analysis shows that Halliburton has an edge over Schlumberger on most of the parameters.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1573,HAL,"The Q3 earnings season is underway with major banks set to report this week. Earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 2.3% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues, as per the latest Earnings Trends.However, earnings growth is on track to be the lowest this year after double-digit growth in each of the first two quarters and with high single-digit expected earnings growth in the last quarter. This is especially true as twin attacks by hurricanes Harvey and Irma have taken toll on many industries such as insurance, energy, airlines and autos. Per Moody's Analytics, the two storms may lead to $150-$200 billion in damages (read: Hurricanes Impact on Earnings ETFs?).While earnings estimates for Q3 have declined from 6.3% at the start of the period, the magnitude of negative revision is lower than the recent quarters. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, seven are likely to be contributors to earnings growth, with energy leading the way. Like the last reporting cycle, the energy sector has the strongest growth projection of 122.3% for Q3, primarily reflecting easier comparisons. This is followed by earnings growth of 16.1% for conglomerates, 9.7% for technology, 8.7% for industrial products, and 8.3% for construction.Given this, we have highlighted one ETF and one stock from some of these sectors that could make great plays as the Q3 earnings season unfolds. Each of these ETFs and stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). For stocks, we have added the extra flavor of a positive Earnings ESP.

1574,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a fall in oil and natural gas rig count in the United States.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 936 in the week ended Sep 15 – lower than the prior week’s 944. Notably, total rig count has declined five times in the last seven weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 506.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations and lower inland water activities.However, count of rigs engaged in offshore operations rose from 16 to 17.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count slipped by seven to 749. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased six times in the last nine weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 416.    Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – fell by one unit to 186. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 89. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.     Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs slipped by eight units to 67, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was in line with the prior week’s 869.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 17 units – 14 of which were oil-directed – higher than the prior count of 16.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs searching for crude and natural gas in the United States has declined. Three rigs were removed from Cana Woodford, a liquid rich shale play. Also, Permian basin and Eagle Ford shale play saw the removal of two rigs each.A persistent fall in drilling rigs in U.S. resources helped crude to reach near the $50-per-barrel mark, significantly higher than the historical low of February 2016.    Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio now are Range Resources Corporation (RRC) and Lonestar Resources US (LONE). Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1575,HAL,"Over the last three years, the energy market has experienced intense price volatility. However, it seems that following an extended period of relative weakness, energy stocks are finally on their way to recovery. With crude now back over $60, the panic that swept over the market is all but gone. The incredible turnaround has stoked high expectations from the energy sector going into the final quarter of 2017.Let's take a look at how oil prices behaved during the fourth quarter of 2017 and what makes the Energy sector a material factor this earnings season.Q4 Report Card: Oil Prices End on a Positive NoteThe U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 32 of the last 40 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 419.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 13.2% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015.Another reason why the U.S. oil benchmark soared nearly 17% last quarter revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. True to predictions, the coalition prolonged the current dynamic for another nine months to the end of 2018. The agreement, now renewed twice, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day (or 2% of global supply) off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended 2017 at $60.42 per barrel – the first settlement above $60 since June 2015. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $53 per barrel mark.All oil-related stocks stand to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q3 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index. The July-September period turned out to be a rather good one with earnings for the sector recording a massive 152.3% jump from the same period last year – the most among all 16 broad Zacks sectors by a long way – on 19.3% higher revenues.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q4 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil prices improved considerably from the year-ago period. In fact, the strongest growth in Q4 is again set to come from the Energy sector. As per our Earnings Preview report, earnings for the sector are expected to be up 178.5% from the fourth quarter of 2016, while the top-line is likely to show an impressive growth of 24.1%.How to Identify the Outperformers?The encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies likely to beat our fourth quarter earnings estimates.Investing in such companies can fetch handsome returns for investors.

1576,HAL,"Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Jan 22, before market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.5%, thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. The world's second-largest oilfield services company, after Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. The company posted average positive earnings surprise of 41.23% in the trailing four quarters. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company Quote This Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells is likely to maintain this trend in the fourth quarter too. Evidently, multiple tailwinds including the recovery in commodity prices have buoyed the entire space.With U.S. activity accelerating and margins set to remain strong, Halliburton is likely to beat estimates in the quarter under review. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the strong earnings estimate revisions with two estimates going up and none going down over the last seven days for the current quarter.Factors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of the fourth quarter were $60.46 per barrel, up about 19.6% sequentially amid tightening supplies, improving demand outlook and OPEC-deal extension talks.The oilfield service provider is poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices.With the North American land market improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing — particularly for pressure pimping — Halliburton remains optimistic of generating higher earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter for Completion and Production revenues is pegged at $3,641 million, higher than $3,537 million and $2,268 million reported in the prior quarter and fourth-quarter 2016, respectively. Sales in the Drilling and Evaluation unit are forecasted to be $1,960million compared with the prior-quarter figure of $1,907 million and $1,753 million in the year-ago quarter.We also appreciate Halliburton’s successful cost-management initiatives amid weak oil prices over a length of time. Last year, the company successfully implemented its plan of cutting annual costs by $1 billion. In fact, Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the industry to its advantage, mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less.All these positive factors are also reflected in the price movement of the company. Shares of the company have rallied over 6% outperforming the broader industry’s decline of 1.9% in fourth-quarter 2017. What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +0.79%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Halliburton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Energy Stocks With Favorable CombinationHalliburton is not the only energy firm looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.8% and a Zacks Rank #3. The energy equipment maker is expected to release earnings results on Feb 5.

Strong drilling activity and pricing on the back of recovery in crude prices led to the outperformance.Estimate Revision Trend & Surprise History: Investors should note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been unchanged in the last 30 days.Nonetheless, Halliburton have an impressive earnings surprise history. Before posting the earnings beat in Q4, the company delivered positive surprises in all prior four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteOverall, the company has a positive earnings surprise of 41.2% in the trailing four quarters.Revenues: Halliburton posted revenues of $5,940 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,567 million.

1578,HAL,"We expect Halliburton Company’s (HAL  -  Free Report) Completion and Production segment — which makes up around 65% of the oilfield service provider’s total revenue and more than 80% of its operating income — to post improved results in fourth-quarter 2017. This could help Halliburton notch its 14th consecutive quarterly outperformance when it reports on Monday, Jan 22.(See more in Is Halliburton Poised for a Beat This Earnings Season?)   The Completion and Production segment supplies cementing, stimulation, intervention and completion services. The unit comprises of production enhancement services, completion tools and services, and cementing services.A Look at Halliburton’s Completion and Production Performance in Q3Completion and Production revenue grew 12.9% sequentially and 62.5% from the year-ago level. Operating income from the segment was $525 million, significantly higher than the $24 million a year ago. The division also improved from previous quarter’s income of $397 million, helped by better utilization and pricing in the North American land market -- especially in Halliburton’s pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing product service lines.Oil Tailwinds to Boost Q4 ActivityWith U.S. rig count falling to record levels in 2016, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds. However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend.The U.S. oil benchmark wrapped up a strong quarter amid continued declines in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, oil ended 2017 at $60.42 per barrel – the first settlement above $60 since June 2015. A year ago, crude futures hovered around the $53 per barrel mark.Though we are still not anywhere near the activity highs seen in 2014, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the long-struggling oilfield service providers.In particular, the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing -- particularly for pressure pumping.Completion and Production Unit to BenefitConsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s largest segment’s fourth-quarter revenue is pegged at $3,641 million, 60.5% higher than the reported figure in the corresponding quarter of 2016 and up 3% sequentially.And with the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company seeing continued pricing strength, its operating income for the division is expected to jump to $570 million from just $85 million in the fourth-quarter of 2016 and representing a 9% sequential increase.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Overall Earnings & Revenue ProjectionsNotably for the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 46 cents reflects a massive growth from the prior-year quarter profit of 4 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $5,574 million indicates a 38.6% increase on a year-over-year basis.Our TakeThe improving oil price outlook and strengthening North American market conditions have led to strong demand for Halliburton’s completions equipment and services. This will support the company’s top and bottom-line growths.Earnings Schedules of Other Major Oilfield Service ProvidersAmong the major players, Schlumberger is scheduled to release today, while Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) will report on Jan 24. Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), another biggie, will report fourth-quarter earnings early next month.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1579,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 939 in the week ended Jan 12 — higher than the prior week’s 924. This marked an increase after the tally decreased for two straight weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 659.   For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 919, higher than 906. The tally for offshore was 19, up from 17. One rig operated in the inland waters last week, in line with the count for the week ended Jan 5.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 752 jumped from 742 recorded for the week ended Jan 5. Moreover, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 522.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 187 was up from 182 for the week ended Jan 5. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 136.  Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 62 units is in line with the tally for the week ended Jan 5. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by 15 units to 877.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 19 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — up from 17 for the week ended Jan 5.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil and natural gas in the United States increased. The addition of three oil rigs in the Permian basin primarily supported the upside.Crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Given that oil crossed the $60-per-barrel mark, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for U.S. shale players to ramp up drilling activities.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG) and EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.    Headquartered in Houston, TX, Cabot is primarily engaged in exploration and development activities. We expect the company to see year-over-year earnings growth of more than 357% in 2017.Headquartered in Houston, TX, EOG Resources is also an upstream energy player. The company is likely to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 155.3% in 2017.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1580,HAL,"The strong momentum seen in 2017 continues this year with stock markets across the globe  witnessing an upside. MSCI World Index has  risen  in eight of the nine trading sessions so far this year. This is primarily thanks to an uptick in global economic growth, low inflation, tightening monetary stance by major central banks, and increasing oil price.On the Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq registered eight record closings  in the first nine trading days of 2018, while the Dow boasted its sixth closing high of the year. Per CNBC, the S&P 500 is enjoying its best 10-day start to a year since 2003, climbing 4.2% buoyed by stronger-than-expected corporate earnings and a slew of upbeat economic data (read: Top-Ranked ETFs Crushing the S&P 500 to Start 2018).Meanwhile, yields are on the rise with two-year U.S. Treasury yields topping 2% for the first time since the financial crisis while the U.S. dollar slumped to a more than three-year low against the euro on speculation that the European Central Bank is preparing to reduce its stimulus. A weak dollar is providing ample strength to the commodities market, which saw a powerful start to the year.  Given this, we have highlighted some ETFs that are off to a good start in 2018 and some that have had a rough start:Best ETFsGlobal X MSCI Nigeria ETF (NGE  -  Free Report)Nigerian stocks are leading the global market rally  in the first two weeks of  the New Year buoyed by a jump in oil prices and the continued strength in the economy, which pulled the country out of recession in the second quarter. Additionally, impressive valuations are making stocks tempting to investors. Nigerian stocks are the cheapest among the major African equity indexes trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10.2 compared to 14 for the South African index and 13 for the MSCI Emerging Market Index (read: 10 Hottest ETF Themes for 2018).As such, NGE, which offers exposure to the largest and most liquid Nigerian securities, soared 15.9% in the first two weeks of 2018. Holding 23 stocks in its basket, the fund has heavy concentration on the top two firms, which collectively make up for 25.4% share. It has accumulated $86.4 million in its asset base and has 1.10% in expense ratio. Average daily volume is lower at 23,000 shares. However, NGE has a Zacks ETF Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a High risk outlook.iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN Cotton continues its stellar run this year after witnessing its best rally since 1998 in 2017. Soaring exports are eating away some of the 2017-18 crop harvest for the commodity, thereby resulting in a spike in cotton prices. The data from the US Department of Agriculture recorded a bumper start to 2018 for cotton export sales as the first week turned out to be its strongest week for shipments since July.This ETN targets the cotton segment of the broad agricultural commodity market by tracking the Barclays Cotton Pure Beta Total Return Index. Unlike many commodity indices, this index offers roll into one of a number of futures contracts with varying expiration dates, as selected, using the Barclays Pure Beta Series 2 Methodology. The product has managed assets of $0.7 million and charges 75 bps in fees per year from investors. Average daily volume is paltry at 1,000 shares. The ETN has gained 15.1% in the initial weeks of 2018 but has a Zacks ETF Rank #5 with a High risk outlook.iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services ETF (IEZ  -  Free Report)The energy sector has been stealing the show in the U.S. equity world since the start of the New Year, given that oil price is on a fantastic run, thanks to geopolitical uncertainty, tightening supply, and soaring demand. While most of the energy ETFs are seeing huge spike, IEZ has jumped 12.2% so far this year. This fund offers exposure to 35 U.S. companies that provide equipment and services for oil exploration and extraction. Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) are the top two firms accounting for 17.2% and 10.6% of its assets, respectively.The product has accumulated $268 million in AUM and charges 44 bps in annual fees. It trades in moderate volume of 80,000 shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) with a High risk outlook (read: Energy ETFs & Stocks Soaring to Start 2018).Worst ETFsiPath US Treasury Steepener ETN (STPP  -  Free Report)The continuation of the stunning flattening yield curve as measured by the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields has been piling up heavy losses for this ETN. This is because the note directly capitalizes on rising interest rates and performs better when the yield curve is rising. The ETN looks to follow the Barclays US Treasury 2Y/10Y Yield Curve Index, which delivers returns from the steepening of the yield curve through a notional rolling investment in the U.S. Treasury note futures contracts.The fund takes a notional weighted long position in 2-year Treasury futures contracts and a weighted short position in 10-year Treasury futures contracts. STPP charges 0.75% in fees and expenses while volume is light at around 3,000 shares. It has AUM of $4.1 million and has shed 11.1% so far this year (read: Yield Curve Flattens: Profit From This ETF).  Rex Volmaxx Long Vix Weekly Futures Strategy ETF (VMAX  -  Free Report)Given the strong complacency in the stock market, volatility has taken a back seat. In particular, VMAX has tumbled 8.7%. It seeks to benefit from a negative correlation between the VIX Index and equity market. The ETF provides long exposure to the VIX Index by holding a combination of VIX futures contracts that are near expiration. It has amassed $2.1 million in AUM and charges 2.90% in fees per year. It sees a meager volume of about 7,000 shares a day (read: Top & Flop Zones of 2017 and Their ETFs).iShares Residential Real Estate ETF (REZ  -  Free Report)Real estate is one of the worst performing sectors to start the year as stronger economic growth and signs of higher inflation have renewed expectation for rising interest rates resulting in sector rotation to more growth-oriented  areas. With AUM of $349.6 million, this ETF provides exposure to the U.S. residential real estate sector, holding 44 stocks in its basket with none accounting more than 9.81% share. It trades in average daily volume of 33,000 shares while charging 48 bps in annual fees. The fund has lost 6.8% in the same time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 with a Medium risk outlook.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1581,HAL,"Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) has divested U.S. oil-well business to a subsidiary of Schlumberger NV (SLB  -  Free Report) for $430 million in cash, scrapping plan of a joint venture.In March 2017, Weatherford decided to put its North American pressure pumping and well completions operations into a venture with Schlumberger for $535 million in cash and a 30% stake in the new business — OneStim. This was an attempt to be more competitive against market leader Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) and fast-emerging companies such as Keane Group Inc.Weatherford will retain the entire leading multistage completions portfolio, manufacturing capability and supply chain and will continue to take part in the growing completions markets in Canada and the United States as well as globally.Recently, the companies abandoned the joint venture. This was mainly because Weatherford sold U.S. pressure pumping assets to Schlumberger and transferred about 100 employees.Due to the growing demand from shale producers, pressure pumping specialists have been benefiting from higher crude prices. In December, Keane Group announced a $115-million investment to expand fleet, owing to high demand and improving economics.The funds raised from the transaction will be used by Weatherford to start deleveraging balance sheet, which reflects a debt of about $7.9 billion. Due to huge losses, the company has been selling assets. In the first nine months of this year, Weatherford incurred a loss of $875 million on revenues of $4.21 billion.Price PerformanceShares of Weatherford have gained 4.3% compared with the industry’s rally of 0.9% in the last six months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksWeatherford carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1582,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a fall in oil rig count in the United States. However, the number of rigs searching for natural gas has increased.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 935 in the week ended Sep 22 – lower than the prior week’s 936. Notably, total rig count has declined six times in the last eight weeks.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 511.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore operations and lower inland water activities.However, count of rigs engaged in offshore operations rose from 17 to 19.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count slipped by five to 744. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased seven times in the last nine weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 418.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – increased by four units to 190. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 92. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 88.2%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.    Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by one unit to 68, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) fell by two units to 867.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 19 units – 15 of which were oil-directed – higher than the prior count of 17.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as a yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States has increased, while that for oil has declined. Overall total oil and gas rigs decreased as a lesser number of drillers gathered in the U.S. shale resources. Eagle Ford shale play and Williston basin saw the removal of three rigs each. Also, two rigs were removed from the DJ-Niobrara basin.A persistent fall in drilling rigs in U.S. resources helped crude cross the $50-per-barrel mark, significantly higher than the historical low of February 2016.   More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1583,HAL,"With just a few days left before we ring in the New Year, it seems to be the right time to reflect on how the Oils-Energy sector has fared so far in 2017 and how it’s poised for 2018.A Look at Energy Sector’s 2017 PerformanceAfter emerging as the top-performing sector in 2016, the Oils-Energy sector has had a relatively turbulent ride this year. Till September, commodity prices have remained volatile and have been hovering mostly within the $45-$55 per barrel range. In the June-August period, it has consistently traded below the threshold mark of $50 a barrel. Notably, in June 2017, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell to nearly $42 a barrel — the lowest in ten months.The lacklustre performance of the sector in the first nine months of the year can be seen from the graph below. The chart clearly indicates that the sector has declined over 5.8% underperforming the S&P 500 index, which appreciated 12.6% over the said period. The sector was plagued with increased domestic oil production which continues to be a potent headwind for the market. While OPEC is taking initiatives to trim output to address the supply gut, it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more. The tightening of global oil market is thus getting undermined and prices have remained under constant pressure. The latest rig count report by Houston-based Baker Hughes hints at an oversupplied market, wherein it reported increase in the total U.S. rig count from 665 to 931, year to date.However, things have started to look up for the sector over the past few months with the prices consistently trading at above the $55 a barrel mark. A number of factors have propelled this positivity. These include the OPEC-led production cut extension, lower inventory overhang and rising demand.Recently the commodity traded at $60 per barrel — the highest mark since Jun 25, 2015. We are optimistic about the fact that the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 index in a month. It has gained 5.72% compared with the S&P 500 index that advanced 2.19% over the same time frame.  Notably, energy has been the best S&P sector performer in the third quarter of 2017. Third-quarter reported earnings figures have been impressive and earnings estimates have started to move north. In fact, among all the 16 Zacks sectors in the index, energy is probably the only one which is expected to witness triple-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Reflecting the bullishness, the sector’s debt has been declining and free cash flow has been increasing, signaling overall improvement in finances.Can Energy Sector Tread on a Growth Trajectory in 2018?Crude supply has been normalizing, which has pushed the price of WTI and Brent to new two-year highs. The improving commodity pricing environment looks somewhat sustainable on the back of tailwinds like the OPEC production cuts which are expected to continue till 2018-end along with improved demand outlook.On Nov 30, 2017, OPEC members met non-OPEC players to decide on an extension of the crude production cut accord, first signed in late 2016. OPEC and fellow exporters also announced plans to remain open to extend their production-cut agreement beyond March, 2018 — an imperative step to combat the global crude glut. Some cartel members including less compliant nations like Iraq have also signalled another round of supply cuts.As expected by most analysts, all crude exporters decided to extend the deal through 2018-end. Through the end of next year, Saudi Arabia, Russia and their allies pledged to put 1.8 million barrels a day of crude oil out of the market.Investors have pinned hopes of recovery on the recent U.S. Energy Department's inventory releases that show multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the domestic crude stockpiles — pointing to a slowdown in shale output. U.S. crude inventories have decreased by 6.5 million barrels to 436.5 million barrels last week, touching the lowest level since October 2015.Adding to the positive momentum, Energy bodies OPEC and IEA recently raised global oil demand forecasts for 2018, helping to tighten the market significantly. The booming crude oil and gas exports this year reflect the substantial demand for U.S. oil.All these factors point toward the growing stability and growth prospects for the energy sector in 2018.How to Identify the Potential Winners?Given the vast size of the sector, it is no mean feat to zoom in on the likely outperformers for the coming year. This is where the Zacks Rank, justifying a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in handy. In addition to a favorable Zacks Rank, the stocks have a sound VGM Score. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Such a score allows you to streamline your search and eliminate the negative aspects of the stocks to select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. Our research shows that stocks with an impressive  VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Apart from a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score, the stocks possess large market capitalizations.  Thus, focusing on such stocks is deemed safe. Their large market capitalizations provide the requisite cushion to combat economic downturns and stringent credit conditions.Invest in These 7 Stocks to Enrich Your PortfolioChevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report): California-based Chevron is one of the leading integrated players and the second largest U.S. oil producer.

1584,HAL,"Markets have enjoyed a strong and enduring rally for nearly all of 2017. Benchmarks have broken several milestones on multiple occasions and are on course to create new annual records. Year to date, the S&P 500 is up more than 20% and is on course to registering its highest gains in four years. Successively strong earnings numbers and robust economic growth have been the primary factors powering these gains.However, this extended market rally was not without its occasional losses. Lingering fears about inflated valuations have dogged stocks for some time now. Geopolitical concerns, particularly those related to North Korea also threatened to spoil the party on more than one occasion. Also, there was much hand wringing over the likelihood of tax cuts receiving legislative approval before they were finally signed into law last week.However, it is increasingly likely that the actions of the new administration will boost stocks further in the days ahead. In such a scenario, S&P 500 stocks which have failed to chalk up gains this year should also stand a chance. This is particularly true for stocks with a strong Zacks Rank, which are well placed to ride the continuing market rally in 2018.Factors which Acted as a Drag on 2017’s RallyEven though benchmarks are now close to notching up annual records, a variety of factors have threatened to end their long running rally. Concerns about inflated valuations, particularly relating to tech stocks, have had investors worried on more than one occasion. Even though such fears have yet to come true, they continue to persist to this day. Further, geopolitical concerns have also clouded market sentiment at times. Such worries were especially heightened during North Korea’s recent nuclear tests. Both South Korea and the U.S. government warned of a strong response during these events, leading to losses for stocks.Coming to specific sectors, energy stocks remained depressed over the year with the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) down 3.6% year to date. During the year, the OPEC and other major oil producers successfully adhered to an output control agreement which lent some support to oil prices. However, a step up in production by U.S. shale producers has led to the persistence of oversupply conditions.Further, traditional safe haven sectors have been largely ignored during the year, with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) up only 7.4% year to date. Instead, investors have favored high growth sectors such as technology in the quest for superlative gains. Industrywide changes have also acted as drags for specific stocks. For instance, the tendency to shop online has caused numerous store closures and created a near brick and mortar apocalypse.Can Tax Cuts, Infrastructure Spending Boost Gains in 2018?On last Friday, President Trump finally signed the much anticipated tax Bill into law.  The exact earnings impact of the tax legislation is yet to become clear, but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost. S&P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up 11.8%, with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation. (Read: What Will the Q4 Earnings Season Bring?)And now that President Trump has scored his first major legislative victory, it is likely that he will press forward with another major issue on his agenda, infrastructure reforms. It is now widely expected that the Trump administration will announce a new infrastructure package in 2018.During his presidential campaign, Trump had promised to implement a $1 trillion infrastructure package. This plan was intended to improve the state of roads, airports and bridges as well as other public works across the country.Recently Trump has commented that his attempt to improve the country’s infrastructure will easily garner bipartisan support. The major obstacle to be overcome is related to funding and if that does happen, markets could receive yet another boost in the year ahead.5 Losers Set to Gain in 2018Even though stocks have notched up strong gains this year, some factors have acted as impediments to gains on several occasions. However, the projected impact of tax cuts and heightened prospects of a new infrastructure package are likely to sustain markets’ rally well into next year.This is why it makes good sense to bet on those S&P 500 stocks which have taken a beating this year but stand a good chance of notching up gains in 2018. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark. This led the stock to take a huge leap and outpace the industry in a month. Clearly, third-quarter results have given a fresh breath of life to the stock, which in the recent past had struggled on account of dismal performance in the preceding two quarters.Foot Locker has lost 33.3% year to date. However, it has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 0.9% over the last 30 days.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

Mosaic should also benefit from its cost reduction measures and its efforts to boost production capacity.Mosaic is down nearly 13% year to date. However, it has expected earnings growth of 14.4% for the current year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 3.8% over the last 30 days.

Relentless focus on expansion of customer base and creation of digital infrastructure to boost the electronic channels business should also fuel growth.Western Union has lost 12.2% year to date. However, it has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Moreover, it has expected earnings growth of 4.3% for the current year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 5.2% over the last 60 days.Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) reported strong third quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. In fact, Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the oil industry to its advantage, mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less.Halliburton has lost 11.2% year to date. However, it has a Zacks Rank #2. Moreover, expected earnings growth for the current year is more than 100%. PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) is poised to gain from its capital investment plan, which primarily focuses on infrastructure construction projects for generation, transmission and distribution. It has reestablished its hedge levels to shield itself from any near-term decline in the GBP.PPL Corp has lost 8.6% year to date. However, it has a Zacks Rank #2. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 0.3% over the last 30 days.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1585,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a rise in natural gas rig count in the United States.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 944 in the week ended Sep 8 – higher than the prior week’s 943. This shows an increase in total rig count for two weeks in a row after four straight weeks of a decline.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in the U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 508.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased activity in inland waters.Rig count in both onshore and offshore operations is in line with the prior week. The respective rig counts for onshore and offshore drilling are 923 and 16.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count slipped by three to 756. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased five times in the last eight weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 414.     Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – jumped four units to 187. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 92. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.      Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by seven units to 75, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by six to 869. Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 16 units – 13 of which were oil-directed – in line with the prior count.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on the demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs searching for natural gas in the United States increased, while that for oil decreased. Overall, total oil and gas rigs increased as the drillers gathered in the U.S. shale resources. Two rigs were added in each of the respective shale plays of Marcellus, Permian and Haynesville.We are expecting more rigs to come online as refiners along the gulf coast, hit by Hurricane Harvey, are gradually restarting operations. In other words, more demand for raw crude from the GoM refiners – accounted for more than 45% of domestic oil refining capacity, per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) – might drive commodity prices and call for more rigs in the oil and gas patches.Development in this front is likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies. Two oil stocks that might make valuable additions to your portfolio are Range Resources Corporation (RRC) and Lonestar Resources US (LONE). Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Based in Fort Worth, TX, Range Resources is an independent oil and gas company, engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of U.S. oil and gas resources. We expect year-over-year earnings growth of almost 1,494.9% for Range Resources in 2017.Headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, Lonestar explores oil and gas resources in the United States. The company is expected to witness 79.7% year-over-year earnings growth in 2017.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1586,HAL,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Halliburton is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for HAL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 22 cents per share for HAL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for HAL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 15.79% heading into earnings season.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that HAL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Halliburton, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1587,HAL,"We are entering the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with a host of S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of next week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 54 S&P 500 members that combined account for 16.9% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 11.9% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues, with 79.6% positive earnings surprises and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have any results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, quite a few companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Energy: First Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks. By June 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefitting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings had very strong year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% of them outperformed the topline.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 276.2% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top-line is likely to show a growth of 14.1% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 24Let’s see what’s in store for three energy companies expected to come up with second-quarter numbers on Monday, Jul 24.One of the largest oilfield service providers in the world, Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) is expected to report before the opening bell. In the first quarter of 2017, this Houston, TX-headquartered provider of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services beat estimates handily, thanks to improved utilization on the back of growing North American rig count.Coming to earnings surprise history, the company has an excellent record: it’s been ahead of estimates in each of the last four quarters. And our model indicates that Halliburton is likely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, Halliburton – with an Earnings ESP of +15.79% and Zacks Rank #3 – is powered with the right combination of these two key ingredients. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteHeadquartered in The Woodlands, TX, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC  -  Free Report) is another energy company set to report second-quarter 2017 results – this time after market closing. The company – which is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) companies of the world – has a bad track of having underperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters.Unfortunately, Anadarko is unlikely to break the trend in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company is a Zacks Rank #4 stock that has an Earnings ESP of -6.67%. (Read more: Will Anadarko Petroleum Miss Earnings Estimates in Q2?)Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Anadarko Petroleum Corporation QuoteLastly, there is specialized service provider Core Laboratories N.V. (CLB  -  Free Report) coming out with Apr-Jun operational results after the closing bell. The company provides reservoir management and production enhancement services to the global oil and gas industry.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the company has a modest record, having managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports.Our model does not indicate that Core Labs is likely to beat on earnings this time around too, as it has a Zacks Rank #5 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.Core Laboratories N.V.

1588,HAL,"Analysts have made their predictions. Now it’s time for the actual results. Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI  -  Free Report) kicked off the energy earnings season when it reported second quarter results yesterday after the market close.Now, it’s the turn of the oil services companies – providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells – to come out with Apr-Jun numbers, which are likely to provide a better understanding of the sector’s prospects in the near future. In particular, key oil services earnings scheduled for release over this week and the next, including Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report), assume greater significance.The world’s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger is scheduled to report on Jul 21, while smaller rival Halliburton will release its second quarter earnings report on Monday, Jul 24. As such, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both of them carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s dive in.Schlumberger and Halliburton are both major players in the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which is ranked a lowly 208 out of the 256 industries in our coverage (bottom 19%). The broader Oil-Energy sector of which it is a part, is also staring down the barrel - currently sitting at the bottom of the Zacks Sector Rank (16 out of 16). (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)Price PerformanceSchlumberger and Halliburton shares have suffered this year, as have shares of all oil-related companies, to reflect the commodity's price slide and uneven outlook. That said, both have done better than their peers. While the Zacks Oil and Gas – Field Services Industry has lost -28.4%, Halliburton is down by just -15.7% year to date and Schlumberger has witnessed its share price decrease by -19.7% since Jan.Earnings History and ESPHalliburton has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014. As far as recent history is concerned, the TX-based firm delivered earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 68.49%. On the other hand, Schlumberger has delivered positive surprises in just two of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of a modest 4.55%.The situation does not change when considering Earnings ESP values as well, with Halliburton clocking in at +15.79% while Schlumberger’s reading stands at +3.33%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dividend YieldSchlumberger’s dividend yield over the last one-year period is 2.97%, higher than the broader industry’s figure of 2.12%. With a dividend yield of 1.58% Halliburton shareholders earn significantly lower dividend yield than Schlumberger as well as the industry at large.ValuationCompared with the S&P 500, the Oil and Gas – Field Services industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future. The industry has an average trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio – which is often used to value oil and gas stocks, given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses – of 8.56, which is below the S&P 500 average of 11.01. Hence, it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 34.16 Halliburton is overvalued compared to the S&P 500 and the industry. However, though Schlumberger also looks pricey compared to the industry and the S&P 500, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 11.69, it defeats Halliburton decisively.Investment StyleAccording to the Zacks style score system, Halliburton has a Value Score of D, Growth Score of A and Momentum Score of A. This stock is therefore most suitable for growth and momentum investors.Schlumberger has a Value Score of D, Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of F, which means that the stock is best avoided.Other MetricsSchlumberger’s expected EPS growth for (3–5 years) is 16.10%. This is better than Halliburton’s growth rate of 8.00%.Also, beta for Schlumberger is 1.02, which shows marginally less volatility than Halliburton’s beta of 1.04.Net profit margin for Schlumberger is 4.95%. This is way better than Halliburton’s net profit margin of -0.29%.Also, Schlumberger has a lower leverage as evident by its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.40 compared with Halliburton’s ratio of 1.20.ConclusionThe comparative analysis shows Halliburton has witnessed a more favorable share price movement throughout the year, possesses a fantastic surprise history, which means it is more predictable, and boasts of a better style score. Additionally, it carries a much higher ESP reading of +15.79%, as against Schlumberger’s figure of +3.33%However, Schlumberger is superior when considering dividend yield and valuation. Moreover, when considering EPS growth, profit margin and debt load, Schlumberger is clearly a better stock.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...

1589,HAL,"The Q2 earnings season is slowly picking up pace, with results from 54 S&P 500 members, that account for more than 16.9% of the index’s total market capitalization, already out.The Picture So FarAs per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies rose 11.9% from the same period last year on 5.5% higher revenues, with 79.6% beating earnings and 72.2% trumping revenue estimates.Energy to Outshine Other SectorsWe have divided the S&P 500 Index into 16 Zacks Sectors. As per our report, among all the sectors, Oil/Energy is likely to be the biggest growth driver. While six of the sectors are projected to report a drop in year-over-year earnings, many are expected to see a slight hike. Meanwhile, the energy sector is likely to outperform the rest with year-over-year earnings growth of 276.2%. This will also mark a massive improvement from the last quarter‘s staggering earnings decline of 654.8%.Research shows that during Q2, the Oil/Energy sector will likely generate quarterly earnings of $10.7 billion, much higher than $4.4 billion recorded during the April-to-June quarter of 2016. Overall, the sector has been showing a steady improvement in the bottom line since 2016.Healthy Oil & Gas Performance in Q2The oil and gas pricing scenario in second-quarter 2017 was much better than the year-ago comparable period.Hopes of OPEC’s production cut deal extension was the prime factor driving the year-over-year hike in prices during April and almost the entire of May. Market anticipations proved somewhat correct as OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018 in the Vienna meeting.Natural gas also made a modest recovery in Q2 after the commodity hit its lowest annual average price in 2016 in almost 20 years.Oilfield Service & Energy Explorers to Watch for Earnings Let’s see what’s in store for two such companies expected to come up with second-quarter numbers on Jul 21. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up at their end.The world’s largest oilfield services company, Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) is expected to report results before the opening bell. Other major oil services firms like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) and Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), will report their earnings next week. Together, the firms are called the ‘big 4 oil service companies’.In the first quarter of 2017, this Houston, TX-based oilfield service provider reported in-line earnings, which was supported by improvement in production of the Kuwait and Egypt developments and increase in directional drilling works in North America.Our proven model shows that Schlumberger is likely to beat earnings because it has the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of +3.33%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Schlumberger N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Schlumberger N.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Schlumberger N.V. QuoteBased in Calgary, Alberta, Encana Corporation (ECA  -  Free Report) is a focused pure-play natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company. It is the second largest gas producer in North America and holds a highly competitive land and resource position in a number of the region's most promising shale and tight gas resource plays.The company will also likely report its results before the opening bell. Last quarter, the explorer reported better-than-expected results following higher realized prices and reduced costs.However, an earnings beat is uncertain for Encana this time as it has an Earnings ESP of -25.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. While a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.

1590,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig count in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count hampers demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report). DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 924 in the week ended Jan 5 — lower than the prior week’s 929. With this, the count fell for two weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 665.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased onshore, offshore and inland operations. The number of onshore rigs were 906, lower than 909. The tally for offshore was 17, down from 18. One rig operated in the inland waters last week against the count of two for the week ended Dec 29. Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 742 fell from 747 recorded for the week ended Dec 29. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 529.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count of 182 was in line with the week ended Dec 29. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 135. Per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 62 units decreased from 65. Moreover, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) declined by two units to 862.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count is at 17 units — 14 of which were oil-directed — down from 18 for the week ended Dec 29.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States remained in line, while the count of rigs looking for oil decreased. Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count fell, primarily due to the removal of five onshore and one offshore rig in Louisiana. Two rigs were also removed from Oklahoma.The crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. The fall in U.S drilling rigs also supported the crude rally.Given that oil crossed the $60-per-barrel mark, we believe that the business scenario has been favorable for exploration and production players.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation (COG  -  Free Report) and Approach Resources Inc. (AREX  -  Free Report). Cabot sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Approach Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1591,HAL,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015 on strong refining demand.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline and distillate supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production revisited its rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.3-6% (or 38 cents) to end at $62.01 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since December 2014.Energy Stocks on a RollWith the federal data showing the seventh consecutive week of U.S. stockpiles decline, energy stocks have been in a strong uptrend lately.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 3.9% and 6%, respectively, in the past month. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 during the period were oil and oil-related stocks like Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report), Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 7.4 million barrels for the week ending Dec 29, following a decrease of 4.6 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 5.7 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output edged up 28,000 barrels per day last week to 9.8 million barrels per day – just 9,000 barrels per day short of last month’s record levels.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 31 of the last 39 weeks and are down almost 109 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 424.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.4% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 2.4 million barrels to 49 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.2 days in the previous week to 24.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 28.9 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the eighth straight week on weak demand. The 4.8 million barrels addition – more than double the polled number of 2 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 233.2 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 1% below the year-earlier level and is also above the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) soared 8.9 million barrels last week, dwarfing analysts’ expectations for 1.3 million barrels increase in supply level. The massive weekly rise could be attributed to higher output and tepid demand. But at 138.8 million barrels, current supplies are still 14.2% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1% from the prior week to 96.7% - the highest since 2005. The operators kept processing large volumes of crude into products to circumvent year-end tax payments on stocks.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY  -  Free Report) may be a good selection. This company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1592,HAL,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Monday, Oct 23, before market opens.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 21.1%. Moreover, both Halliburton’s segments – Completion and Production, as well as, Drilling and Evaluation – reported revenues slightly better than our estimates thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.On a further encouraging note, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014, as you can see in the chart below:Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteImportantly, this Houston, TX-based provider of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells is likely to maintain this trend in the third quarter. Evidently, multiple tailwinds including the recovery in commodity prices have buoyed the entire space.With U.S. activity accelerating and margins set to remain strong, Halliburton’s underlying results are likely to come ahead of our expectations. The positive sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the fact that the estimate revision trend has been solid with eight upward estimate revisions and just one down in the last two months.Consequently, the stock has done better than the peer group so far this year; it is down 17.5% in 2017 as against 30.2% loss for the Zacks Oil and Gas Field Services industry. Let’s delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Halliburton’s third-quarter results.A Likely Positive Surprise?With U.S. rig count falling to record levels last year, oilfield services players (like Halliburton) were hit hard. Unprecedented declines in activity levels and a sharp fall in upstream spending led to lower revenues and pricing headwinds.However, as commodity prices steadily improve and drilling activities pick up, the market for services companies is on the mend. Though we are still not anywhere near the activity highs seen in 2014, spending on exploration projects have experienced a much-awaited rebound. The energy explorers, buoyed by the jump in commodity prices, are set for improving sales and earnings – a part of which is likely to be pocketed by the long-struggling oilfield service providers.In fact, during last quarter’s earnings release, the company also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pimping.As a proof of the resurgence in activities, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Completion and Production revenue is pegged at $3,430 million, much higher than $3,132 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Sales in the Drilling and Evaluation unit is forecasted to be $1,888 million, more than the prior quarter figure of $1,825.We also appreciate Halliburton’s successful cost-management initiatives in the midst of weak oil prices over a length of time. Last year, the company successfully implemented on its plan of pruning annual costs by $1 billion. In fact, Halliburton has used the challenges prevailing in the industry to its advantage, mainly by offering low cost solutions that aids producers in churning out more by investing less.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too shows that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company stands at +0.08%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Halliburton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. On the other hand, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Which Other Energy Companies Have Positive Surprise in Store?Halliburton is not the only energy firms looking up this earnings season. Here are some companies from the space which, according to our model, also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.91% and a Zacks Rank #2. The energy equipment maker is expected to release earnings results on Oct 26. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Suncor Energy Inc. (SU  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +29.60% and a Zacks Rank #2. The Canadian integrated energy company is anticipated to release earnings on Oct 25.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1593,HAL,"We have already seen a few releases from S&P 500 companies in the Q2 earnings season. Major oilfield services companies will start reporting results starting Jul 21. Although our report shows that the Oil/Energy sector might post the healthiest earnings performance among all the 16 Zacks sectors, the story for the Zacks categorized Oil & Gas-Field Services industry is somewhat different.The industry has been grappling with huge debt and low cash balances. On top of that, cash flow from core operations is getting weaker by the day. The April-to-June quarter of 2017 has not been able to reverse the unimpressive performance of the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry over the last few quarters. Most importantly, during Q2, the industry underperformed the S&P 500 index.About the Oil & Gas Field Services IndustryCompanies belonging to this industry primarily support drilling players in efficiently setting up oil and gas wells. These firms are mainly engaged in manufacturing, repairing and maintaining equipment required for pumping oil.Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) are four premier oil field services companies. These companies are often referred to as the ‘Big Four.’Schlumberger, the largest player in the oilfield services industry, is expected to report Q2 earnings on Jul 21, while Halliburton – the second largest player in terms of market capitalization – will likely report on Jul 24. The companies carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while the Earnings ESP for the respective firms are + 6.67% and +15.79%, respectively. Hence, our proprietary model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for the firms this quarter.Past Performances Lack LusterDeclining Cash Flow: The industry has not been performing well since the beginning of 2015. Our proprietary model shows that net cash flows from core operations in the industry has declined nearly 55% over the last two years.Huge Debt Load: The industry is faced with a high debt level. From $6000 million in long-term debts at the end of 2013, the level scaled to $8,500 at 2016-end. Also, cash balance declined substantially last year to slightly above $4,500 million.Industry Lags S&P 500 Pricing chart is generally referred to for analyzing the performance of any stock or industry over a period of time. The price chart clearly shows that the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index throughout the second quarter.During the aforesaid period, the index rose 2.7% while the industry declined 15.6%. It is to be noted that in terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, the Oil & Gas-Field Services industry is among the weak performing industries. The industry is ranked #205 and lies in the bottom 20% of industries.What’s Behind the Bleak Scenario?Oil & Natural Gas Prices WeakOil and gas prices have been low for almost three years now and during second-quarter 2017, the prices of both the commodities slipped further. The prolonged weakness is owing to a persistently oversupplied commodity market.During the April-to-June quarter of this year, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Also, OPEC’s historical production cut extension deal until Mar 2018 has failed to drive oil.Natural gas is also an oversupplied commodity as is reflected by its inventory level of 2.816 tcf – as of Jun 23 – almost 7% higher than the five-year average mark (as per The U.S. Energy Information Administration).Oilfield Services Players at a DisadvantageDeclining oil and gas prices act as a deterrent for exploration and production companies as it affects the cashflow. In fact, many upstream companies are cutting down on their capital investment for exploitation activities which has led to a decline in proved reserves.These developments might reduce contracts for oilfield service companies.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

1594,HAL,"Major oilfield service provider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 24.In the preceding three-month period, the Houston, TX-based company reported better-than-expected operating earnings on improved utilization from growing North American rig count.The world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates. The company posted a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, the average being 68.49%. Investors should note that Halliburton hasn’t missed earnings estimates since mid-2014.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise  Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteFactors to Consider This QuarterDrilling activities have increased of late due to an improvement in North American land market. This is likely to help Halliburton witness higher revenues in the domestic markets. During the second quarter, the count of U.S. rigs have increased around 15% to 940. Over the last one year the U.S. rig count has increased around 116%. This increased rig count bodes well for the oilfield service player Halliburton. During the quarter, the international rig counts also rose by about 2%. Halliburton, which generated 48% of its total revenue from international operations in the last quarter, is likely to benefit from the higher international rig count.  President Trump’s exit from Paris Climate accord also provided an impetus to drilling activities.Moreover, the company’s new CEO, Jeff Miller, is contemplating about raising the company’s various services rates, which are likely to boost the revenues of the company. Halliburton expects the prices to increase by at least 10% and in some cases 20% or more this year.During the quarter, the company acquired the Tulsa-based Summit ESP. We expect Halliburton to gain from this acquisition given that devices manufactured by Summit ESP are in high demand and are being utilized by upstream energy players for extending the life of shale wells. The development is likely to help the company to earn significant cash flow for stockholders. However, the cost of acquisition may weigh on the financials of the company in the quarter. As it is, the company has weak financials with high debt and low cash reserves.We appreciate Halliburton’s successful cost-management initiatives in the midst of weak oil prices. However, with the rise in North America’s shale oil patch activities, the company is actively engaged in increasing its headcount. Halliburton has increased its active fleet by 30%, which required the company to increase employment by more than one-third of its workforce to 2,700 workers in the Permian Basin. The increased costs on this account might adversely effect earnings.Further, weaknesses in oil and gas prices could mar demand for oilfield services. During the second quarter, oil and natural gas prices fell 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Lower commodity prices might lead to reduced exploration and production activities. This could lead to lower investments by oil majors which will impact revenues of the oilfield services companies. This is also reflected in the share price of Halliburton which witnessed a decline of around 14% in the second quarter.Halliburton Company Price  Halliburton Company Price | Halliburton Company QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Halliburton is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +15.79%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 22 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 19 cents.Zacks Rank: Halliburton, under the Zacks categorized Oil and Gas - Field Services  industry, currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Please note that we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Halliburton, here are some energy firms in the same industry you can consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:ProPetro Holding Corp.(PUMP  -  Free Report) is anticipated to release earnings on Aug 8.

1595,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd.

This marked an increase after the tally declined for the week ended Dec 15.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 in last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 653.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The number of onshore rigs were 910, higher than 909. The tally for offshore and inland activities remained in line with the count for the week ended Dec 15.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, while 19 rigs worked offshore.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was in line with the count for week ended Dec 15.

Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of four rigs in Cana Woodford shale and two rigs in the Barnett shale play. One rig was added in each of Permian and Williston basins, respectively.Overall crude pricing scenario has been healthy after the OPEC members agreed to extend the production curb deal beyond first-quarter 2018. Also, natural gas price recovered from historical low mark, touched last year.Two energy stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

1596,HAL,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to reach the lowest level since 2015. But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline supplies. On a further bearish note, domestic oil production maintained its steadily rising trend that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 0.9% (or 53 cents) to end at $58.09 per barrel yesterday. Energy Stocks JumpThe federal data sparked widespread buying in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – up more than 1.4% Wednesday. The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 0.5% and 0.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK  -  Free Report), Concho Resources Inc. (CXO  -  Free Report), Pioneer Natural Resources Company (PXD  -  Free Report) and Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report). Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 6.5 million barrels for the week ending Dec 15, following a decrease of 5.1 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.2 million barrels. An uptick in refinery demand led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as U.S. output edged up 9,000 barrels per day last week to 9.8 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 29 of the last 37 weeks and are down nearly 97 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 436.5 million barrels, current crude supplies are 10.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year. Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up by 754,000 barrels to 53 million barrels. The crude supply cover was down from 26.1 days in the previous week to 25.6 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.5 days. Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the sixth straight week on strong production. The 1.2 million barrels addition – more than the polled number of 1.1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 227.8 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.4% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range. Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) was up 769,000 barrels last week, greater than analysts’ expectations. The weekly rise could be attributed to lower demand. At 128.8 million barrels, current supplies are 16.1% below the year-ago level and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of the year. Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.7% from the prior week to 94.1%. About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry. Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?

1597,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services Baker Hughes Inc. reported a record high for rigs searching for crude in the country while rigs for natural gas declined.  DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production in the U.S. totaled 952 for the week ended Jul 14, 2017. The count is in line with the previous week’s count. Last week, the count increased after the number of rigs in the country fell – following 23 successive increases – during the week ended Jun 30, 2017.Since plunging to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale production. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 447.For the week in discussion, the in-line rig count could be attributed to higher onshore activity (now at 928 compared to last week’s 927), while units engaged in offshore operations remained flat at 21. However, rigs involved in inland waters fell by one unit.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count jumped by two to 765. Most importantly, this emphasizes the highest mark for oil rig count since Apr 2015. Also, the current tally, though far off from the peak of 1,609 attained in Oct 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 357. Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – inched down for the fifth time in 14 weeks to 187 (a fall of two rigs from the previous week). Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 89. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is languishing nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by two units to 76, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by two to 876.   Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count was flat at 21 – 18 of which were oil-directed.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count heavily weighs on the demand for energy services – drilling, completion, production, etc. – provided by companies like Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionAlthough the number of rigs searching for natural gas in the U.S. fell from the prior week, the rig exploring for crude reached a historical high despite persistently weak oil prices. In other words, shale drillers have proved that their operations are still profitable despite crude trading slightly above the $45-per-barrel level. Let’s analyze the broader macro scenarios supporting the shale players. OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided in the Vienna meeting on May 25, to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018. Thus, it is an ideal time for shale players to increase production at the expense of OPEC, especially because oil is trading way above the historical low of last February. No wonder, U.S. shale producers have again started gathering to oil patches as they aim to sell the commodity at higher prices.We should consider President Trump’s exit from Paris Climate accord as a factor encouraging drillers to continue pumping more oil. Now, it will be prudent to wait and watch whether shale drillers continue to add rigs in oil resources.Till then, in case you are looking for energy names for your portfolio, one could opt for Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ  -  Free Report). It has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Calgary, Alberta-based Canadian Natural Resources is engaged in the acquisition, development and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas properties.

1598,HAL,"On Jul 13, oilfield service player Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report) was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on negative estimate revision following weak balance sheet and unfavorable business scenario owing to low oil and gas prices.  Key FactorsOver the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Weatherford’s 2017 loss has been widened to 97 cents from 93 cents. Also, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss has been revised to 28 cents from 27 cents over the same time frame.The company’s long-term debt load has been on the rise through all four quarters of 2016. Notably, last year, Weatherford saw its long-term debt surge nearly 30% year over year with little sign of reduction during first-quarter 2017. On top of that, cash equivalents declined almost 50% during the January-to-March quarter of this year, reversing the trend of steady improvement during 2016.Moreover, during 2016, multiple credit rating agencies lowered the rating of the company’s debt and the company expects a further downgrade owing to unfavorable business conditions. Most importantly, as per S&P Global Ratings, the company’s senior unsecured debt is rated B – signifying highly speculative bond. Also, Moody’s Investors Services has rated senior unsecured debt at Caa1, which signifies that the bond has substantial risks.Given the high debt load and weak credit ratings, we think Weatherford might face difficulties in generating debt capital for future growth projects. Additionally, the persistent weakness in oil and gas prices has hurt most of the upstream energy players’ exploration and production activities. This could lower the number of contracts for oilfield services players like Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) from explorers for efficiently setting up oil and gas wells.Weatherford’s pricing chart also lacks luster as the company fell 34.2%, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks categorized Oil Field Mechanical & Equipment industry over’s 13% decline.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.        More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1599,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in crude rig count in the United States. The number of rigs exploring natural gas, however, declined from the prior week.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count heavily dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 923 in the week ended Nov 22 — higher than the prior week’s 915. This marked an increase for three consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 593.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works rose from 21 to 22, while the tally for onshore activities jumped to 900 from 893.One rig operated in the inland waters last week. The count remains the same this week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was higher than 738 in the prior week. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 474.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest last August — fell by one unit to 176. However, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 118.  As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs increased by three units to 66, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by five units to 857.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 22 units — 18 of which were oil-directed — higher than the prior count of 21.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has increased, while the same for natural gas decreased. Overall total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of two rigs in the Permian basin. DJ-Niobrara basin witnessed a rig addition for upstream operations.   A rise in total rig count, both from the year-ago and prior week figures, were primarily supported by rising oil and natural prices. Recently, crude and gas traded at $58.11 per barrel and $2.93 per million Btu respectively, higher than last year’s average marks of $43.29 and $2.52 – per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Investors should know that lower U.S. oil inventory, owing to ramp up in export and more demand from refinery plants, supported the crude price.Recovering commodity prices are likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies.

1600,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in rigs searching for crude and natural gas in the country. DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 943 in the week ended Sep 1 – higher than the previous week’s 940. This shows that the total rig count in the country has increased again after four straight weeks of a decline.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 497.For the week in discussion, the improvement in rig count can be attributed to higher onshore activities.Rig count in the onshore business increased by three units, while units engaged in offshore operations fell slightly to 16 from 17 in the prior week.  Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count was in line with the count of 759 recorded in the previous week. It is to be noted that the rigs exploring crude has decreased four times in the last seven weeks.The current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 407. Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – jumped three units to 183. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 88. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs rose by four units to 68, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by one to 875.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count went down to 16 units – 14 of which were oil-directed – from 17 counts.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on the demand for energy services, drilling, completion, production, etc., provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report)            .ConclusionThe number of rigs searching for natural gas in the United States increased, while that for oil remained flat. This shows that Hurricane Harvey, which was responsible for heavy downpour in the Texas and Louisiana states of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) area, failed to lower exploration activities.Although rig count in Texas fell by one unit and the count in Louisiana was flat as compared to the prior week, it seems that the storm has not been felt as much as apprehended.However, the counts might not be exact as the storm kept Baker Hughes from confirming the increase or decrease in the number of rigs in almost 47 counties of South Texas.After Harvey, some refiners are restarting their operations which led to a rally in the price of black gold. This is likely to prove beneficial for oil exploration and production companies.

1601,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in rigs searching for crude and natural gas in the country.  DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 940 in the week ended Aug 25 – lower than the previous week’s 946. This shows that the total rig count in the country has declined for four weeks in a row.Since it hit an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 489.For the week in discussion, the decline in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore activities.Rig count in the onshore business fell by seven units, while units engaged in offshore operations increased slightly to 17 counts from 16 in the prior week.   Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count fell by four to 759. This emphasizes that the rigs exploring for crude has decreased four times in the last six weeks. However, the current tally, though far off from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 406.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – fell by two units to 180.

1602,HAL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 14.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Second-Quarter 2017 Results Halliburton reported better-than-expected second quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.Halliburton’s adjusted income per share from continuing operation (excluding special items) came in at $0.23, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19 – the twelfth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $4,957 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,844 million.North American Market Continues to Gather StrengthAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pumping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last year since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by nearly 25% sequentially, ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 21%.Additionally, the international market seems to have bottomed out, with regional sales rising 7% from the first quarter on heightened Latin American activity, together with increased well completion and drilling services in Europe and Africa. However, pricing pressure continued with the slowdown in Middle East stimulation services.Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $397 million, turning around from the year-ago loss of $32 million and the previous quarter’s income of $147 million, helped by strong pressure pumping activity and improved pricing in the U.S. land market.But Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation unit profit dropped – from $154 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $125 million this year and was only marginally ahead of the $122 million earned in the Mar quarter. The setback was on account of pricing pressure, partly offset by higher drilling activity in Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, a seasonal rebound in the North Sea and Russia, plus increased fluid services in Asia Pacific.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the second quarter was $327 million.As of Jun 31, 2017, the company had approximately $2,139 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,816 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 54.7%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been  eight moves up in the last two months. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 7.4% due to these changes.Halliburton Company Price and Consensus  Halliburton Company Price and Consensus | Halliburton Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Halliburton's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for Momentum based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock. The magnitude of these revisions also looks promising. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are expecting an inline return from the stock in the next few months.(NOTE: We have reissued this article to correct an error.

Shares have lost about 14.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Second-Quarter 2017 Results Halliburton reported better-than-expected second quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.Halliburton’s adjusted income per share from continuing operation (excluding special items) came in at $0.23, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19 – the twelfth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $4,957 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,844 million.North American Market Continues to Gather StrengthAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pumping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last year since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by nearly 25% sequentially, ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 21%.Additionally, the international market seems to have bottomed out, with regional sales rising 7% from the first quarter on heightened Latin American activity, together with increased well completion and drilling services in Europe and Africa. However, pricing pressure continued with the slowdown in Middle East stimulation services.Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $397 million, turning around from the year-ago loss of $32 million and the previous quarter’s income of $147 million, helped by strong pressure pumping activity and improved pricing in the U.S. land market.But Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation unit profit dropped – from $154 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $125 million this year and was only marginally ahead of the $122 million earned in the Mar quarter. The setback was on account of pricing pressure, partly offset by higher drilling activity in Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, a seasonal rebound in the North Sea and Russia, plus increased fluid services in Asia Pacific.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the second quarter was $327 million.As of Jun 31, 2017, the company had approximately $2,139 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,816 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 54.7%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been  eight moves up in the last two months. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 7.4% due to these changes.Halliburton Company Price and Consensus  Halliburton Company Price and Consensus | Halliburton Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Halliburton's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a B.

1604,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in rigs searching for crude in the country while rigs for natural gas increased.  DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 946 in the week ended Aug 18 – lower than the previous week’s 949. This shows that the total rig count in the country has declined for three weeks in a row.Since it hit an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 491.For the week in discussion, the decline in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore and offshore activities. Units engaged in offshore operations decreased slightly to 16 counts from 18 in the prior week while the rig count in the onshore activity fell by one unit.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count fell by five to 763. This emphasizes that the rigs exploring for crude has decreased for three times in the last six weeks. However, the current tally, though far off from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 406.  Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – inched up by one unit to 182. Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 83. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89%, below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs fell by six units to 66, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was up by three to 880.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count went down to 16 units – 14 of which were oil-directed – from 17 counts.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count weighs heavily on the demand for energy services – drilling, completion, production, etc. – provided by companies like Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).  ConclusionAlthough the number of rigs searching for natural gas in the United States inched up from the prior week, the rig exploring for crude slipped. This shows that oil explorers have started lowering capital spending with an aim to combat crude glut.  Two prospective oil stocks that could be included in your portfolio include Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report) and Lonestar Resources US (LONE  -  Free Report).  Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Based in Fort Worth, TX, Range Resources is an independent oil and gas company, engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of U.S. oil and gas resources. We expect year-over-year earnings growth of almost 1,611.9% for Range Resources in 2017. Lonestar is expected to witness 79.7% year-over-year earnings growth in 2017.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1605,HAL,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015. On a further bullish note, domestic oil production snapped its steadily rising trend and fell for the first time since October.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline and distillate supplies.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.3% (or 20 cents) to end at $59.84 per barrel yesterday – within touching distance of the more-than-two-year highs reached earlier in the week.Energy Stocks on a RollWith the federal data showing the sixth consecutive week of U.S. stockpiles decline, energy stocks have been in a strong uptrend lately.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 2.9% and 7%, respectively, in the past month. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 during the period were oil and oil-related stocks like Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Dec 22, following a decrease of 6.5 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.5 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand and decline in U.S. output for the first time in more than two months led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 30 of the last 38 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 431.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.6 million barrels to 51.4 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.6 days in the previous week to 25.2 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the seventh straight week on strong production. The 591,000 barrels addition – less than the polled number of 1.3 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 228.8 million barrels. Following last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now up 0.6% year over year and is also above the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) was up 1.1 million barrels last week, as opposed to analysts’ expectations for 780,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The surprise weekly rise could be attributed to higher output. At 129.9 million barrels, current supplies are 14.3% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.6% from the prior week to 95.7%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, HollyFrontier Corp.

1606,HAL,"Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), a firm in the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat.This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, HAL has beaten estimates by at least 10% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations.Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago, HAL was expected to post 19 cents per share, while it actually produced 23 cents per share, a beat of 21.1%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver 38 cents per share, when it actually saw 42 cents per share instead, representing a 10.5% positive surprise.Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise Halliburton Company Price and EPS Surprise | Halliburton Company QuoteThanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Halliburton. In fact, the Earnings ESP for HAL is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat.After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company’s earnings prospects. This is the case for HAL, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.36%, so another beat could be around the corner.This is particularly true when you consider that HAL has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP, a positive earnings surprise happens nearly 70% of the time, so it seems pretty likely that HAL could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1607,HAL,"TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) recently won a Engineering, Procurement & Construction contract for Snorre Field Expansion Project. The contract was awarded by the integrated major Statoil ASA  which owns a 33.3% stake in the Snorre field. Other partners in the field include Petoro AS, ExxonMobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report), Idemitsu Petroleum Norge AS, DEA Norge AS and Point Resources AS, holding a 30%, a 17.4%, a 9.6%, an 8.6% and a 1.1% stake, respectively. Discovered in 1979, the Snorre field started production in 1992. The field is located at the Tampen area in the northern part of the North Sea, 300-380 meters below sea level. So far, the Snorre field has produced 1.4-billion barrels of oil.The Snorre field plays an important part in Statoil's attempt to enhance long-term value and operations at Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). Snorre expansion is the largest improved oil recovery project (IOR) on the NCS and provides valuable production and activity, which are beneficial for Statoil and other co-partners in the project.The Snorre Expansion contract covers the delivery of subsea production systems and includes 6 subsea templates and subsea production equipment. TechnipFMC hasdelivered subsea equipment to Snorre since the field started production.Early this month, TechnipFMC was awarded a contract worth $4.2 billion by the Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco). TechnipFMC's strong backlog — of $13.9 billion as on Sep 30, 2017— underscores the steady demand from customers and enables the company to steer clear of uncertainties better than many of its peers. The robust backlog is likely to contribute to the long-term earnings and cash flow visibility of the company. Zacks Rank & Key PickLondon-based TechnipFMC is a leading manufacturer and supplier of technology solutions for the energy industry. The company, which reached its current form following the January 2017 merger between Technip and FMC Technologies, is engaged in designing, producing and servicing technologically sophisticated systems and products for subsea, onshore/offshore, and surface projects.TechnipFMC has lost 11.4% of its value year to date compared with 26.6% decline of its industry. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked player in the same industry is Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1608,HAL,"Among the major oilfield services firms, Schlumberger Limited (SLB) and Halliburton Company (HAL) deserve a special mention, given their massive market caps of $86.4 billion and $38.8 billion, respectively. These companies dominate and define the industry to which they belong to.Both of these firms have interesting earnings surprise histories. Halliburton surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the prior four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 41.2%. However, Schlumberger beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in only one of the last four quarters and came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.2%.Given that West Texas Intermediate crude recently traded at $60 per barrel– the highest mark since Jun 25, 2015 – we can say the business environment is highly favorable for oilfield services players. The latest rig count report by Houston-based Baker Hughes (BHGE) clearly shows that the number of rigs exploring for oil and gas in the United States has increased from 665 to 931, year to date. Ramping up drilling activities should call for more oilfield service contracts. Although both the stocks are attractive picks for investors based on their earnings reports and favorable business scenario, our research shows Halliburton is a better choice than Schlumberger for 2018. The AnalysisWe have employed three parameters for an in-depth comparative analysis.Positive Earnings Estimate RevisionsEarnings estimate revisions are at the heart of the Zacks investment philosophy. Stocks that have recently had their estimates revised upward by analysts tend to outperform the market in the next 9-12 months.In the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Halliburton’s 2018 earnings has risen from $2.11 per share to $2.16 per share. Moreover, for 2018, we expect the company to report year-over-year earnings growth of 86.5%.However, the story is different for Schlumberger. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised downward, from earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.14 in the last 60 days. Also, for 2018, we anticipate the company to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 46%.Strong Potential to Generate Cash FlowInvestors often look for indicators that help them determine the ability of a company to generate free cash flow from investments. For this purpose, we have employed the free cash flow yield ratio. Companies with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield.Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for Halliburton is 3.7%, higher than 3.5% for Schlumberger.  Sufficient Funds to Meet Capital ExpenditureA company’s free cash flow is calculated after deducting capital spending from operating cash flow. In the last four quarters, free cash flow for Halliburton came in at $1.566 billion, indicating that the firm has sufficient cash flow to fund capital spending.In other words, Halliburton generated $2.516 billion in net cash from core operations, while its capital spending amounted to $950 million. Most importantly, its trailing twelve-month free cash flow for 2017 has turned positive from negative free cash flow of $2.279 billion in 2016, reflecting massive improvement in the company’s operations. Although Schlumberger’s free cash flow of $3.289 billion is higher than that of Halliburton, it has been decreasing steadily since 2015. If the trend continues, Schlumberger’s reliance on debt capital for financing future operations will increase.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that the returns from investment at Halliburton are higher than Schlumberger. On top of that, earnings estimate revision trends are also in favor of Halliburton.This is reflected in Halliburton’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which suggests that the stock could outperform the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. Meanwhile, Schlumberger carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1609,HAL,"Welcome to Episode #107 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by Zacks Director of Research, Sheraz Mian, who is also a former oil analyst, in their annual, end of the year discussion about the price of oil and the oil stocks.Their first podcast on the oil industry was in December 2015. Since then, they’ve given predictions about what would happen with crude, and the energy companies.Tracey’s the first to admit that they have been wrong in the past. In late 2016, for example, Tracey and Sheraz had concerns about if the E&Ps and the drilling contractors could even find the workers to re-start rigs and increase production (they did.)Additionally, OPEC and the other big producers like Russia, actually came to an agreement on production cuts AND haven’t really been cheating.Has Oil Finally Bottomed?US rig counts have jumped dramatically in the last year but that growth stalled out in August 2017.Crude supply has been normalizing, which has pushed the price of WTI and Brent to new 2-year highs.Most analysts believe the worst of the price declines are likely over. But it’s unclear how much higher crude could move in 2018.Tracey and Sheraz discuss the possible scenarios for price increases including geopolitical events in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, as well as record US oil production.Investors Have Fled the Oil StocksCrude initially plunged in 2015. Since then, there have been several “false” rallies in the oil stocks which have spooked investors.The oil stocks are now mostly being ignored. But third quarter earnings were the best in several years and earnings estimates are back on the rise.If you’re an investor looking to get back into the oil stocks, where should you invest?Big Oil, the E&P stocks, or the service companies?Or should you be buying in all three?Oil Stocks to Buy in 20181.      Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report) is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the first time since 2008. Earnings are expected to be up 52% this year and 12% next year. You also get its refining and chemical businesses.2.      Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) is really expected to see a jump in earnings after a tough 2016. EPS is forecast to rise by 327% in 2017 and another 17% in 2018. Chevron has more exposure to rising oil prices than some of its competitors.3.      Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD  -  Free Report) is one of the largest E&P players in the Permian Basin, which is one of the key shale producing regions in the United States. Earnings are also on the move higher, jumping 800% this year and another 107% in 2018.4.      Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) is the market leader in the US in hydraulic fracturing but also has the international side. Investors may want to look at the opportunities outside of the US. HAL is expected to grow earnings by 82% next year.5.      RPC (RES  -  Free Report) is the most profitable pumper in the US. It continues to raise prices and sees this pricing power holding through the first quarter of 2018. Earnings are expected to rise 222% this year and another 88% next year.There are plenty of other names investors should also focus on, as the entire industry is being ignored by the Street. Tracey and Sheraz discuss some other possibilities.The turn in the earnings, to the upside, is undeniable though. The “story” is changing in the energy sector.What other surprises await oil stock investors in 2018?  Find out on this week’s podcast.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1610,HAL,"As per North Dakota’s oil regulator, the state’s daily crude output fell 0.8% in Jun after dropping 0.9% in the previous month. The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources’ (‘DMR’) latest data said that oil production in Jun averaged 1,032,495 barrels a day, down 8,500 barrels a day from May.Along with Oil, Gas Production Falls TooWhile daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fifth month in a row, the small decline reflected in the newest numbers confirm the slowdown in the amount of oil extracted from North Dakota, centered on the Bakken Shale formation. Interestingly, it must be noted that at the end of June, the state’s total number of producing wells tallied 13,915, a new all-time high.With crude, natural gas output came down too – from May’s record 1,853,528 thousand cubic feet per day to 1,849,807 thousand cubic feet per day. As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken, wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude (present gas flare rate of around 12%).Current Production a Shadow of Earlier HighsChurning out as high as 1,227,483 barrels/day in Dec 2014, the current production statistics highlight oil’s horror show that has seen prices come down from $110 per barrel in mid-2014 to around $47 now, in between falling to a 12-year low of $26.21 in Feb 2016. The commodity’s collapse has fueled spending cuts and layoffs while threatening the industry’s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows, drying up liquidity and narrowing profit margins.Rig Count Clawing Back Steadily but Unlikely to Rise FurtherSome 55 drilling rigs were active in the state in Jun, up from 50 in May and Apr. The all-time low of 27 was set in May 2016, while a year ago, North Dakota had just 28 rigs operating. A closely watched yardstick of oil industry's strength, the steady rise in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates increase in drilling activities and essentially steady production.Notwithstanding recent gains, the rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling. Moreover, with oil prices tumbling some 19% year-to-date, the number of rigs are unlikely to ramp up beyond 55 this year. It’s because the current crude levels just won’t support any more drilling rigs.Increase in Wells, Rig Count Offset by Lack of Fracking CrewsEven as the rig count in North Dakota continues to rise and the number of producing wells in the state reach record highs, production is being stymied by the lack of hydraulic fracturing crews. At present, there are just around 22 frack crews in the state, not even half of the number of rigs. In particular, major oilfield service providers like Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) are struggling to get experienced, qualified workers following mass layoffs triggered by the three-year crude slump. The ongoing labor shortage is primarily responsible for the recent drops in North Dakota’s oil production numbers.Shale Industry Caught in a “Catch-22” SituationWhile more rigs in operation and stable production could be construed as positive developments for the state of North Dakota, the current sub-$50 oil prices will render a lot of drilling as unprofitable. And at the crux of the matter is the rising flood of U.S. shale-driven production.Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques.With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $50 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. In other words, while OPEC's moves to trim output and rebalance the demand-supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent, in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more.In other words, the U.S. shale (including the likes of North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas) is perhaps the biggest reason why crude prices are floundering again.What Lies Ahead?The fall in Jun production assumes greater significance considering that the oil bust is now anticipated to last through this year and well into 2018. In fact, with Jun production levels barely above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark, there are chances that output in the second-largest oil producing state after Texas could fall below that figure toward the end of 2017 if prices fall under $45 a barrel and stay there for an extended period. But as of now, output should remain steady for at least the next two months.Dakota Access Pipeline: Can It Revive Production?While the oil weakness is expected to persist at least till the first half of 2018, there is one factor that might speed up the revival of Bakken output – the 1,100-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline.Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners L.P.’s (ETP  -  Free Report) $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration. As a result, disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the sponsor brought the controversial conduit online in early Jun.With the project’s arrival, operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market. In fact, around 78% of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines, with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24% earlier in 2017 to less than 10%.Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region’s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators. Set to carry about 500,000 barrels of oil daily, or more than 50% of North Dakota’s output, the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U.S. oil producing areas like the Williston and Permian basins.This, industry observers hope, will set the ball rolling for Bakken’s production revival and help producers like Continental Resources Inc. (CLR  -  Free Report) and EOG Resources Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report).Still Interested in Oil Stocks?Given the bearish oil pricing scenario, it shouldn't come as a surprise that most of the companies from this space are set to underperform in the near term. Furthermore, the Oil-Energy sector has a Zacks Sector Rankin the bottom 6% (15 out of 16), so there is little hope for a turnaround soon.

1611,HAL,"Drilling contractor Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to acquire Houston-based drilling player Tesco Corporation  to consolidate the oilfield services industry further.Why the Move?The oilfield services and drilling industry being one of the worst sufferers of oil slump had lowered mergers and acquisitions post 2014. Through the downturn period, energy companies remained focused on stabilizing their balance sheets and undertook various cost-cut initiatives.However, with the crude pricing witnessing a partial recovery from the lows associated with downturn, energy companies started inking various strategic deals to enhance their capabilities. With the markets starting to stabilize with the changing dynamics within the oil and gas sector, merger and acquisition deals have also been picking up in the oilfield services industry.Limited organic growth along with low volumes and weak margin expectations left the companies in the drilling and oilfield services industry primed for consolidation. The companies thus are focusing on accelerating M&A activities which not only complement their existing portfolios but also help to enhance their capabilities and competencies. Various M&A deals have been entered upon or completed in the last few months. These include Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report) - General Electric merger, Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) - Summit ESP LLC merger and Trican Well Service Ltd - Canyon Services Group, Inc. merger among others.The recent news of amalgamation of Nabors – owner of the world's largest land-based drilling rig fleet – and Tesco which is noted for its technology-based solutions is likely to further reinforce Nabors position as the equipment and drilling services provider.Deal HighlightsThe acquisition will be an all stock transaction worth $215 million, wherein Nabors will purchase all the issued and outstanding shares of Tesco in exchange for 0.68 common shares of the former. The deal values Tesco’s stock at $4.62 reflecting a premium of about 19% on the Tesco’s closing price of $3.90 on Aug 11. The transaction value also represents a 30% premium of the total enterprise value of Tesco based on its cash balance as of Jun 30.  After the closure of the deal, which is expected to take place in the fourth quarter of 2017, upon necessary approvals and satisfactory conditions, shareholders of Tesco will own 10% of the shares of Nabors. However, if the deal fails to close by Feb 14, 2018, Tesco will be liable to pay Nabors a cash termination fee of $8 million.Expected SynergiesThe deal is a win-win transaction for the both the companies which is likely to result into various financial, commercial, and operating synergies.Nabors, which has a stretched balance sheet with a debt-to-capital ratio of over 55%, will be able to deleverage itself to certain extent by the issuance of shares for the acquisition of Tesco, which is free of debt as of Jun 30.Nabors Drilling Solutions unit will be benefited by Tesco’s tubular running services which are expected to provide Nabors with comprehensive solutions and integrated offerings. This in turn is likely to drive the revenues of the company and position it for increased benefits amid the rising oil production of late. Further, Nabors intends to synthesize its rig equipment subsidiary Canrig Drilling Technology Ltd. with Tesco’s equipment unit which is well noted for its product offerings and aftermarket service. This bodes well for the directional and horizontal drilling process of the company.The deal is expected to result into operating synergies of around $20 million in the first year followed by full run-rate synergies of $30-$35 million along with further capital savings. The acquisition will also provide Tesco an enhanced platform and scale thereby boost its potential for market share gains in the light of stronger and wider offering of complementary products and services.   Zacks Rack Barbados-based Nabors conducts oil, gas, and geothermal land drilling operations along with offering a number of ancillary well site services, including oilfield management, engineering, transportation, construction, maintenance, well logging, and other support services in select domestic and international markets. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1612,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report) reported a rise in rigs searching for crude in the country while rigs for natural gas declined.  DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the U.S. totaled 949 in the week ended Aug 11 – lower than the previous week’s 954. This shows that the total rig count in the country has declined for two weeks in a row.Since it hit an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in American shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 481.For the week in discussion, the decline in rig count can be attributed to lower onshore activity (now at 928 compared to last week’s 934). However, units engaged in offshore operations increased slightly to 18 counts from 17 in the prior week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count jumped by three to 768. This emphasizes that the rigs exploring for crude rose again after last week’s fall. Also, the current tally, though far off from the peak of 1,609 attained in Oct 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 396.   Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – inched down for the seventh time in 14 weeks to 181 (a fall of eight rigs from the previous week). Like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 83. As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is nearly 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs fell by one unit to 72, while the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) was down by six to 801.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count went up to 17 units – 15 of which were oil-directed – from 16 counts.Details of the Weekly Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count heavily weighs on the demand for energy services – drilling, completion, production, etc. – provided by companies like Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionAlthough the number of rigs searching for natural gas in the U.S. declined from the prior week, the rig exploring for crude rose despite persistently weak oil prices. In other words, debt-laden shale drillers have proved that their operations are still profitable despite crude trading below the $50-per-barrel threshold.Let’s analyze the broader macro scenarios supporting shale players. OPEC and 11 non-OPEC players, including Russia, decided in the Vienna meeting on May 25, to extend the production cut deal until Mar 2018. Also, according to Saudi Arabia, there is a possibility of deeper production cut, if required, in the 173rd OPEC meeting on Nov 30, 2017. Thus, it is an ideal time for shale players to increase production at the expense of OPEC, especially because oil is trading way above the historical low of mid-February last year. No wonder, U.S. shale producers have again started gathering to oil patches as they aim to sell the commodity at higher prices.We should consider President Trump’s exit from Paris Climate accord as a factor encouraging drillers to continue pumping more oil. Now, it will be prudent to wait and watch whether shale drillers will continue to add rigs in oil resources.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1613,HAL,"Picture Thus FarThe Q3 earnings cycle is in full swing with 138 S&P 500 members that account for 32.9% of the index’s total market capitalization having reported their numbers. Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 7.3% from the same period last year on 4.9% higher revenues, with 70.3% positive earnings surprises and 68.1% beating revenue estimates.As of now, very few energy companies have reported their third-quarter results. Notably, just two energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q3 numbers. These include the major oilfield services players Schlumberger Limited (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Schlumberger reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.(Read more: Schlumberger Posts In-Line Q3 Earnings, Revenues Miss)Halliburton Co. reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. Notably this is the 13th consecutive earnings beat recorded by the company. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.(Read more North American Strength Drives Halliburton Q3 Earnings)Q3 Report Card: Oil and Gas Prices End on a Positive NoteOil: Prices of oil at the end of the third quarter improved amid continued decline in domestic inventories and an improving supply-demand narrative. With fundamentals pointing to a tighter market, price of oil at the end of the third quarter was $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially. A year ago, crude prices lingered around $45 per barrel.Natural Gas: Prices of natural gas dropped about 3.5% in the July-September period owing to the fuel’s tepid demand due to mild weather conditions and hurricane-related power outages. Despite the sequential fall, natural gas prices remain favorable when compared with the corresponding period of 2016. The commodity futures ended the quarter at $3 per MMBtu, up more than 3% from the Sep 30, 2016 settlement of $2.9 per MMBtu.Energy Companies to Gain from Higher Prices: As we know, the profitability of energy companies is directly affected by fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Therefore, all oil/gas-related stocks are poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the Q2 earnings season reflects that earnings for the sector recorded a massive 252.7% jump from the same period last year — by far the highest growth among all sectors — on 16.8% higher revenues.The energy sector is poised to see the strongest growth in Q3 again. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 122% from third-quarter 2016, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 16.3% from the year-ago levels.Energy Stock Reporting Q3 Earnings on Oct 26Let’s see what’s in store for four energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers.Texas-based leading refinery player Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report) is slated to report results before the opening bell.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13.89%, courtesy of higher throughput margin. Moreover, Valero surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average of 18.24%.Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Valero Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Valero Energy Corporation QuoteValero is expected to keep its earnings streak alive this quarter also as it has the right combination of the two ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s refining segment earnings is $1,372 million, higher than $990 million recorded in the year-ago quarter and $959 million in the prior quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $20,183 million for the third quarter, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and carried a Zacks Rank #2.Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC  -  Free Report) an independent oil refiner and marketer is set to release results before the market opens.The Findlay, OH-based downstream operator has a mixed earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the last four quarters. In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.96% on lower gross margins and elevated costs.Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Marathon Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Marathon Petroleum Corporation QuoteHowever, our model indicates that Marathon Petroleum is likely to beat on earnings estimates this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.09%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from refining and marketing is pegged at $419 million, 36.9% higher than the reported figure in third-quarter 2016. We also expect profitability in its midstream (or pipeline transportation) segment to be 62.8% higher than the year-ago quarter to stand at $420 million. Earnings are likely to be driven by solid process and fractionation volumes, along with contribution from investments in new projects.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +0.14% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Energy equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report) will report its results after the closing bell.National Oilwell Varco has a good track record of earnings surprise history, courtesy of its cost-reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies. The company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 10.46% in the trailing four quarters.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | National Oilwell Varco, Inc. QuoteBased on our model, National Oilwell is likely to beat on earnings even this time, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +13.04%.Rising momentum in the U.S. markets and modest improvement in international markets along with increasing consumer demand are likely to improve the revenues of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the Wellbore Technology segment is $672 million compared with $614 million reported in second-quarter 2017 and $526 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Our model predicted earnings beat earlier too. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an earnings ESP of +10.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Upstream energy player EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is set to report results before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 6 cents per share surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. EQT delivered average positive earnings surprise of 102.17% in the trailing four quarters.EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  EQT Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteHowever, our proven model does not show that EQT is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -31.31% and a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the current quarter is estimated at 2,303 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), which is higher than 2,177 MMcfe/d recorded in the preceding quarter and 2,131 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter. The company is poised to benefit as the midstream business might rake more profits for EQT given the fact that U.S. drillers continue to bank on shale plays.However, we are concerned by the increased spending of the company. EQT is expected to spend $1.5 billion in 2017.  During first-half 2017, EQT’s operating expenses related to transportation and processing activities surged more than 66%. If the trend continues, it might hurt EQT’s earnings.Even earlier, our model did not indicate that EQT will beat on earnings this season. When we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of -163.91% and carried a Zacks Rank #3.Zacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

1614,HAL,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged gains.On the news front, oilfield service majors Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report) and Halliburton Co. (HAL  -  Free Report) kicked off the energy earnings season. Importantly, both companies indicated that activity in North America remain strong. Meanwhile, Swiss rig behemoth Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report) received a new contract award for one of its ultra-deepwater drillships.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up about 0.8% to close at $51.84 per barrel, while natural gas prices gained 1.5% to $2.915 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: RDS.A Buys EV Charging Network, CVX Cancels Australia Drilling Plan.)The U.S. oil benchmark registered a modest climb after the U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles fell for the fourth straight week.The bullish impact from the crude inventory draw was supported by other developments including mounting tensions between Iraq and Kurdistan near the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, President Trump’s decision not to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, and a falling U.S. rig count.However, the gains were kept in check by concerns over a new wave of domestic shale oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Meanwhile, natural gas futures finished higher following an in-line increase in supplies. Current stocks – at 3.646 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) – are now 35 Bcf (1%) under the five-year average, while dropping 179 Bcf (4.7%) below the year-ago figure.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    The world’s largest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger Ltd., reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of 42 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and higher than the year-ago figure of 25 cents.The strong results were driven by solid demand for directional drilling in the North American land market. This was partially offset by major project completions in Mexico and Iraq, where the company wrapped up major service contracts.The oilfield service player expects activity in North America – where Schlumberger has a significant client base – to continue growing but cautioned that the rate might slow down from previous quarters on account of flattening rig count.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had approximately $4,952 million in cash and short-term investments and $15,871 million in long-term debt. This represents a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 30%. In the July-to-September quarter, the company bought back 1.5 million shares. (Read more: Schlumberger Posts In-Line Q3 Earnings, Revenues Miss.)2.    Smaller rival Halliburton Co. reported better-than-expected third quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America – the company’s largest market by sales. Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents – the thirteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.Along the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pumping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one and half years since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by 14% sequentially, well ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 6%.Additionally, Halliburton’s international market proved resilient in the face of challenging circumstances. The company’s impressive expense management for the last several quarters helped regional sales rising more than 4% from the second quarter. (Read more North American Strength Drives Halliburton Q3 Earnings)3.    Offshore driller Transocean Ltd. recently reported that its ultra-deepwater drillship Deepwater Invictus has received a two-year contract from a subsidiary of mining company, BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report). Per Transocean, the contract will begin in the second quarter of 2018.The contract for Deepwater Invictus, which joined Transocean's fleet in 2014, includes three one-year priced options. Transocean expects the backlog related to the contract to be around $106 million. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is yet to declare the exact dayrates for the rig. In this context, we would like to remind investors that Deepwater Invictus’ first contract with BHP in 2014 had a dayrates of $595,000. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Built in Korea's DSME shipyard, Invictus can operate in water depth of up to 12,000 feet. It can drill 40,000 feet deep wells. The drillship worked for BHP in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Trinidad. Invictus is presently in the Gulf of Mexico, south of Louisiana. (Read more Transocean's Deepwater Drillship Invictus Wins New Contract)4.    Oilfield services company Core Laboratories N.V. (CLB  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 48 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. The figure also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter adjusted earnings of 38 cents.Although the company’s operations in the third quarter were affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, it surpassed its updated guidance. Damages to Core Laboratories’ facilities were minor. Despite the unfavorable situations faced by the company and its clients due to flooding, power outages and wind damages caused by the hurricanes, its results were better than the year-ago quarter, thanks to the rising demand for the company’s products.As of Sep 30, 2017, Core Laboratories had cash and cash equivalents of $13.8 million and long-term debt (including lease obligations) of around $233.9 million. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 60.4%. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $4.9 million.Importantly, the company generated free cash flow of approximately $25 million in third-quarter 2017. (Read more Core Laboratories Q3 Earnings & Revenues Top Estimates)5.    Oilfield service provider TechnipFMC plc (FTI  -  Free Report) recently agreed to buy the Wellhead exploration equipment and services business from Plexus Holding plc for jack-up applications. This will lead to a collaboration between the two companies’ subsidiaries in order to upgrade Plexus’ technology.Per the deal, TechnipFMC will give £15 million ($19.8M) initial gross cash consideration to Plexus. Depending on the future performance of the jack-up business during an earn-out period of three years, TechnipFMC will give up to £27.5 million ($36.3 million) more. The earn-out can potentially raise the total cash consideration to £42.5 million ($56.1 million).The acquisition will expand TechnipFMC’s portfolio in the field of high pressure high temperature (HPHT) and in the mudline. It will help the company to serve better in the global jack up exploration drilling market. With contracts raining for TechnipFMC, we believe this move will help the company to serve its clients more efficiently. It will improve the quality of the products and services it offers. Since June 2017, the company won four contracts from different energy companies.

It was again Schlumberger that was the major laggard during this period, experiencing a 17.3% price decline.What’s Next in the Energy World?As usual, market participants will be closely tracking the regular releases i.e. the U.S. government statistics on oil and natural gas - one of the few solid indicators that comes out regularly. Energy traders will also be focusing on the Baker Hughes data on rig count.However, the 2017 Q3 earnings remain the primary focus this week, with a number of S&P 500 members coming out with quarterly results.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1615,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported a decline in total rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 930 in the week ended Dec 15 — lower than the prior week’s 931. This marked the decrease for the first time after the tally rose for five weeks in a row.Since the all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 637.For the week in discussion, the fall in rig count can be attributed to decreased offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works fell from 20 to 19. The tally for onshore and inland activities remained in line with the count for the week ended Dec 8.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, while 909 rigs worked onshore.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 747 was lower than 751 in the prior week. However, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 510.       Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest last August — of 183, was up from 180 for the week ended Dec 8. Moreover, like oil, the rig count for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 126.        As per the latest report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 60 units fell from 64. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by three units to 870.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 19 units — 15 of which were oil-directed. The present count shows a decline from 20 units recorded in the week ended Dec 8.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has decreased, while the same for natural gas went up. The total oil and gas rig count slipped, thanks to the removal of four rigs from Cana Woodford shale and three from the Permian basin.Rig counts have recently snapped a five-week streak of gains. However, it is difficult to say whether the tally will continue to fall in the coming weeks. This is because the crude pricing scenario is healthy and OPEC’s November production has touched a six-month low, per the monthly oil market report of the cartel.Two oil stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc.

1616,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in total rig counts in the United States.About the Rig CountBaker Hughes’ data, issued since 1944 at the end of every week, helps energy service providers gauge the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry.Change in Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count dents demand for energy services like drilling, completion and production provided by the likes of Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report), Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 931 in the week ended Dec 8 — higher than the prior week’s 929. This marked an increase for five consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 624.   For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in onshore works rose from 908 to 909. The tally for offshore activities remained in line with the count for the week ended Dec 1.Two rigs operated in the inland waters last week, higher than one rig for the week ended Dec 1.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 751 was higher than 749 in the prior week. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 498.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count — which plunged to its lowest level last August — of 180, was in line with the count for the week ended Dec 1. Moreover, like oil, the count of rigs for gas exploration sits comfortably above the year-ago tally of 125.     As per the most recent report, the number of natural gas-directed rigs is almost 89% below the all-time high of 1,606 achieved in late summer 2008.        Rig Count by Type: The number of vertical drilling rigs of 64 units fell from 66. However, the horizontal/directional rig count (encompassing new drilling technology that has the ability to drill and extract gas from dense rock formations, also known as shale formations) increased by four units to 867.Gulf of Mexico (GoM): The GoM rig count stands at 20 units — 16 of which were oil-directed — in line with the count for the week ended Dec 1.ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring oil in the United States has increased, while the count of rigs searching for natural gas remained the same. Naturally, the total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of three rigs in each of Permian basin, Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Haynesville shale plays.A healthy crude price scenario owing to the consistent compliance of the OPEC members with the historical production curb deal have been encouraging U.S drillers to ramp up upstream operations in prospective shale plays.  Two oil stocks that should make valuable additions to your portfolio are Northern Oil and Gas, Inc. (NOG  -  Free Report) and Approach Resources, Inc. (AREX  -  Free Report). Northern Oil and Gas sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Approach Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1618,HAL,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 1.9% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsHalliburton reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits, courtesy of  improved utilization and pricing gains in North America – the company’s largest market by sales.Halliburton’s income from continuing operation came in at 42 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents – the thirteenth consecutive quarterly outperformance. Moreover, revenues of $5,444 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,318.9 million.North American Market BoomingAlong the results, Halliburton also sounded optimistic in its view that the North American land market is improving rapidly, driven by increased utilization and pricing - particularly for pressure pimping. As it is, rig counts have generally been rising during the last one and half years since plunging to an all-time low of 404 in May 2016, with the addition of a flood of new units. As a proof of the recovery, Halliburton grew its domestic land revenue by 14% sequentially, well ahead of the U.S. land rig count growth of 6%.Additionally, Halliburton’s international market proved resilient in the face of challenging circumstances. The company’s impressive expense management for the last several quarters helped regional sales rising more than 4% from the second quarter.Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Completion and Production segment was $525 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $24 million. The division also improved from previous quarter’s income of $397 million, helped by better utilization and pricing in the North American land market - especially in Halliburton’s pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing product service lines.Meanwhile, Drilling and Evaluation unit profit improved from $151 million in the third quarter of 2016 to $180 million this year. The number was also above the $125 million earned in the June quarter. The outperformance was on account of higher drilling activity in the Middle East, North America and Latin America. This was supported by an expanding Consulting and Project Management product line in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the third quarter was $342 million.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had approximately $1,898 million in cash/cash equivalents and $10,423 million in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 53%How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to five lower.VGM ScoresAt this time, the stock has a great Growth Score of A, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

1619,HAL,"In its weekly release, Houston-based oilfield services player Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE  -  Free Report), reported an increase in natural gas rig count in the United States. The number of rigs exploring oil remained in line with the prior week.DetailsWeekly Summary: Rigs engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in the United States totaled 915 in the week ended Nov 17 — higher than the prior week’s 907. This marked an increase in total rig count for two consecutive weeks after the tally fell for five weeks in a row.Since it slipped to an all-time low of 404 last May, rig count has been rising rapidly in U.S. shale resources. Punctuated by a few pauses, the current nationwide rig count is considerably higher than the prior-year level of 588.For the week in discussion, the rise in rig count can be attributed to increased onshore and offshore operations. The count of rigs engaged in offshore works rose from 18 to 21, while the tally for onshore activities jumped to 893 from 888.The number of rigs for inland waters remains flat with the previous week.Oil Rig Count: Oil rig count of 738 is in line with the prior week mark. Also, the current tally, though far from the peak of 1,609 attained in October 2014, is significantly above the previous year’s count of 471.Natural Gas Rig Count: The natural gas rig count – which plunged to its lowest last August – increased by eight units to 177.

(SLB  -  Free Report), Weatherford International plc (WFT  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG  -  Free Report).ConclusionThe number of rigs exploring natural gas in the United States has increased, while the count for oil remains the same as last week. Overall total oil and gas rig count has increased, primarily supported by the addition of five rigs in the Permian basin. Haynesville shale play witnessed two more rigs for upstream operations.  A rise in total rig count, both from the year-ago and prior week figures, were primarily supported by recovering oil and natural prices. Recently, crude and gas traded at $56.09 per barrel and $3.05 per million Btu respectively, higher than last year’s average marks of $43.29 and $2.52 – per The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).Recovering commodity prices are likely to prove beneficial for oil and gas exploration and production companies.
