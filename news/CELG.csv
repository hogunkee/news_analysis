0,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) took another sell-side beating Friday after investment bank Leerink suggested its rate of drug-development success lags the industry average for biotech companies.During a presentation Thursday, Celgene suggested that its success rate for internally sourced pipeline products is as good as, or marginally better than, industry peers, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.But an analysis of Celgene's pipeline named in the 2013-14 time frame shows a different story. Celgene seemingly withdrew two-thirds of the assets identified in those years from development. Only one of 20 programs resulted in a marketed product, Porges said.""The average success rate of Phase 1 assets in the pharmaceutical industry is about 10% and rises to around 65% in Phase 3,"" he said. ""If we use these numbers as industry bench marks, the success rate of Celgene's pipeline appears subpar.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, shares dipped 1.1% to close at 78.63. Shares of biotech companies collectively lifted 0.3%.Celgene stock has been under pressure. It toppled to a four-year low Monday after a report emerged that its head of business development quietly exited in April. The firm has also faced high-profile setbacks for Crohn's disease and multiple sclerosis drugs.Porges called it ""the worst performing stock in our coverage of large-cap biotech companies."" Year to date, it's down 24% and has lost 42% since the failure of experimental Crohn's disease drug mongersen in October.""Investors have assigned very little value to the pipeline Celgene has, and our analysis of the productivity of Celgene's R&D activity in the past five years suggests the current negative sentiment may be warranted,"" he said.Leerink analyzed the evolution of pipeline assets highlighted in earnings slides and annual presentations from the first quarters of 2013-18. Of those, Celgene only brought two new chemical entities to market: psoriasis and arthritis drug Otezla and cancer drug Idhifa.More than half of those in development in 2013-15 appear to have been discontinued, Porges said. About a third are still in development. Meanwhile, Celgene has added uses for blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid as well as Otezla.""However, the overreliance on Revlimid and the associated uncertainty about generic entry are in turn also the major overhang on Celgene's stock,"" he said. ""Even for Revlimid, the company has increasingly been reliant on price, rather than volume.""Last year, Celgene raised the gross price on Revlimid by a combined 19.8%, he said. Analysts note that the cancer drug will face a patent cliff in the mid-2020s. Investors have recently begun to doubt Celgene's ability to offset a massive decline in Revlimid sales as competition looms.The firm seemingly takes a two-pronged approach to drug development, collaborating on early-stage assets while acquiring revenue-ready, late-stage drugs. But the success rates of internally developed and externally acquired assets are not markedly different, he said.In total, Celgene introduced 40 drug candidates to its pipeline over the past five years. Celgene removed half of those from its pipeline, and of those 20 that disappeared, four were late-stage assets, while the firm dropped 11 that were in Phase 1 development.""It is understandable that Phase 1 assets are typically riskier and are therefore likely to fail more frequently, but the dropout of Phase 3 assets is concerning,"" Porges said. Still, he kept his 115 price target and outperform rating on the stock.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

1,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) plunged to another four-year low Monday on a report that an executive in charge of business development quietly retired in mid-April.But RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says the departure of George Golumbeski was planned years in advance of his April 16 retirement. Golumbeski had worked for Celgene business development for about nine years.Robert Hershberg took over as executive vice president, head of business development and global alliances, in April 2017. Golumbeski then moved to more of a strategic role. Hershberg was responsible for the deals with Juno Therapeutics and Impact Biomedicines.""Given that this has been a transition in the works for some time, we do not see any relation between reports about this emerging today and proximity to upcoming (clinical study) readouts,"" Abrahams said in a report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Celgene toppled 4.7% to close at 74.69. Shares touched a low last seen in May 2014. Broadly, shares of biotech companies dropped 1.6%. Abrahams noted investor sentiment on Celgene has been low this year.Two weeks before Golumbeski's departure on April 16, former chief operating officer Scott Smith unexpectedly departed Celgene. Smith had been instrumental in helping to launch Otezla, one of Celgene's biggest moneymakers.Celgene delivered a beat-and-raise earlier this month. Otezla sales grew and beat views. Still, investors are wary of the inflammation and immunology franchise. In February, U.S. officials delayed Celgene's application for multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod.Meanwhile, investors are also concerned about a looming patent cliff for key cancer drug Revlimid. Celgene is hoping the acquisition of Juno will help offset some of that. Juno is working on a number of cancer treatments.Abrahams found it ""somewhat ironic"" that shares would sell off on news of Golumbeski's departure. Investors have long been critical of the biotech company's business development strategy, which they see as not sufficiently preparing for post-Revlimid revenue sustainability.""However, we do believe it illustrates the sharply negative sentiment pervasive in the name, which we continue to believe will require a turnaround in catalysts to improve on,"" he said.RELATED:New Option Strategy Limits Risk Around EarningsHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?The Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle

2,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) plunged more than 7% Monday on a report from Morgan Stanley suggesting its experimental multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod could be delayed by up to three years.But shares recovered a little as other analysts disagreed, saying the issue identified by Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison is largely a nonissue. Celgene stock lost 4.5%, at the closing bell, ending the day at 87.10. Shares rose a fraction after hours.During a recent presentation at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting, Celgene noted there were some discrepancies between converting the amounts of specific substance used in preclinical studies of ozanimod in rats and monkeys to human-size doses.Harrison suggested that could be the reason the Food and Drug Administration refused to file Celgene's application for ozanimod. He further suggested it could mean a one- to three-year delay for Celgene to re-file.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Given the timeline to start the study, produce the study reports and re-file, we believe the delay is at a minimum one year and up to three years if management must redo all animal work,"" he said in a note.Celgene got ozanimod in its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos in 2015. Receptos did early studies of ozanimod in rodents for six months and in primates for nine months.Part of those studies tested the effect of a metabolite in ozanimod known as CC112273. A metabolite is a substance formed in, or necessary for, metabolism. For animal studies to be acceptable, the tests must closely mirror the impact a drug would have in humans.It appears ""exposure of CC112273 in animal models was likely below a relevant human therapeutic dose,"" Harrison said. This wasn't a problem for other metabolites. Notably, researchers discovered the issue with CC112273 in a later human study, he added.The FDA refused to file Celgene's application for ozanimod in February. Celgene cited issues in the ""non-clinical and clinical pharmacology sections"" of the application. It didn't go further into the specific problems.Celgene shares plummeted to a four-year low on that news. Also early this month, Scott Smith, a key executive who helped build up Celgene's inflammation and immunology business, unexpectedly left the company. Chief Executive Mark Alles took up his primary duties.Harrison kept his 93 price target and equal-weight rating on Celgene.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed argued if the FDA's decision on ozanimod is related to the CC112273 metabolite, it's really a nonissue. More than 4,000 human patients have taken ozanimod over two years.""If there was a deleterious effect on (effectiveness), safety or (toxicology), it would have shown up,"" he said in a report. ""Going back to introduce massively higher levels of the metabolite than animals create on their own, when we already know this does not impair safety or (effectiveness) in humans is irrelevant.""He added, ""It's creating a condition that does not exist.""Syed also performed a survey of 56 investors. Of those, 37% believe Celgene will refile with the FDA for approval in the first half of 2019. Slightly less, 36%, expect the firm to refile in the second half of 2018.RBC analyst Brian Williams believes Celgene has already begun additional preclinical work on ozanimod. Researchers discovered the CC112273 metabolite about a year ago. So even if Celgene needs to perform two years of additional study, it's already halfway through.Williams and Evercore analyst Umer Raffat also noted in separate reports that Celgene publicly brought attention to the issue in an email to analysts.""Celgene proactively drawing attention to this issue could be a signal of confidence into Friday's earnings call (and an) ozanimod filing update,"" Williams said in a note.Evercore's Raffat expects Celgene to wrap up additional studies on ozanimod as a multiple sclerosis drug in the summer. Then, it will likely re-file for approval in the late summer or early fall, he said in a note to clients.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Next Nvidia?

3,CELG,"A top executive who helped launch the third biggest moneymaker for Celgene (CELG) unexpectedly departed the No. 3 biotech late Monday, just a year after he took over as chief operating officer and president.Celgene offered few details on the departure of Scott Smith, who left the firm effective immediately, according to a news release issued after the close Monday. Chief Executive Mark Alles took over his primary duties.""Scott has made significant contributions to Celgene, most notably building our inflammation and immunology franchise, including the global launch of Otezla,"" Alles said in a prepared statement. ""We thank Scott for his service and wish him well in his future endeavors.""Smith served as president and chief operating officer starting in April 2017. He joined Celgene in 2008 and has held a number of senior positions over the years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Celgene is modifying its executive team structure to enhance leadership focus on building Celgene for continued long-term success,"" the company said in its release.Importantly, Alles also took over leadership of the company's hematology and oncology, and inflammation and immunology franchises, as well as manufacturing, regulatory and clinical development.Smith's departure follows several struggles in Celgene's inflammation and immunology drug franchise.Sales growth of Otezla, which was approved in 2014 to treat psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis, slowed last year. In 2016, sales jumped nearly 116% to $1.02 billion. But in 2017, Otezla revenue was up just 26% to $1.28 billion.Also late last year, Celgene terminated several trials in Crohn's disease, prompting the firm to cut its long-term guidance. The guidance cut came during a quarter in which Otezla sales widely missed analyst expectations.Further, the Food and Drug Administration in February refused to file Celgene's application for a drug called ozanimod as a treatment for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The late February decision sent Celgene stock to a four-year low.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Celgene slipped another 0.6% after ending the regular session down 2.4% to 87.07.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

4,CELG,"An agreement by Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) to defer drug price increases in an effort to play nice with President Donald Trump led analysts Wednesday to question what the fallout of the drug giant's action would be for the industry.Analysts wondered whether other pharmaceutical companies would follow Pfizer's example. Though, notably, Celgene (CELG) is still going ahead with 5% increases for blockbuster cancer drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report.""Pfizer's unprecedented reversal of its early July price increases marks tangible administrative influence,"" Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said in his report to clients. He noted Pfizer is awaiting more details from a so-called blueprint to tug down drug prices in the U.S.Late Tuesday, Pfizer said Chief Executive Ian Read had an extensive discussion with Trump, leading the company to back off price increases on drugs that had been effective July 1. Earlier in the week, Trump attacked Pfizer and others for raising ""drug prices for no reason.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Pfizer shares the president's concern for patients and commitment to providing affordable access to the medicines they need,"" Read said in a written statement. He also noted Pfizer had committed $5 billion of capital to expand manufacturing in the U.S.But not everyone jived with Pfizer's and Trump's announcements.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called on Pfizer and the Trump administration to reveal the details of the arrangement that led Pfizer to back off drug prices increases.""Secret, sweetheart arrangements with Big Pharma companies are exactly why America's drug pricing system is broken,"" he tweeted. ""Trump and his Admin are busy trying to score cheap PR points why Pharma (companies) continue to raise prices by DOUBLE digits.""Pfizer stock dipped 0.6% at the close, to 37.21. Broadly, shares of pharmaceutical companies fell about the same amount on the stock market today.Trump renewed his pledge in May to lower the cost of prescription medicine in the U.S. At the time, analysts largely said the proposed blueprint appeared to be more rhetoric than reform.Morgan Stanley's Risinger believes Pfizer's U.S. price increase reversal could have slightly negative implications for the second-quarter earnings season. He notes Pfizer's updated guidance commentary will be key later this month.""In addition, the news could put a near-term damper on future price increase action by other pharma-bio companies,"" he said. ""But Pfizer indicated that its action is temporary since it only committed to keeping prices unchanged through the end of 2018.""Other pharmaceutical companies could also rethink their 2019 guidance, he said.""Whether manufacturers limit themselves to one price increase per year or hold off entirely on customary January increases is key swing factor to earnings which we think is underestimated by the market,"" he said.Even Celgene's price increases for Revlimid and Pomalyst remain in line with 2018 medical inflation of 5.3%, RBC's Abrahams said. They are also below historical increases. Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) joined Pfizer and walked back on planned price increases, he noted.""We see this more reserved price increase and increased transparency as potentially tempering headline risk and public scrutiny, as has been experienced by Pfizer, and it's in line with our view that companies will self-police in price increases to a much larger degree from now on,"" he said.Also Wednesday, Pfizer announced it would split its business into three distinct units in 2019 as it contends with looming losses of exclusivity. Under the restructuring, Pfizer's Innovative Medicines division will include biosimilars, anti-infection drugs and sterile injectables. Its Established Medicines unit will include off-patent branded and generic drugs, Finally, the company's Consumer Healthcare branch will hold all over-the-counter medicines.Innovative Medicines will run all the current Innovative Health businesses as well as the new Hospital Medicines business unit. Pfizer will also incorporate its biosimilar portfolio into its Oncology, and Inflammation and Immunology units.Established Medicines will hold the majority of Pfizer's off-patent drugs. This includes Lyrica, cholesterol drug Lipitor, high blood pressure drug Norvasc and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. The business will run globally.The unit is meant to operate ""as a true stand-alone business within Pfizer,"" the company said in a news release. It will have its own manufacturing, marketing, regulatory and, with some exceptions, enabling functions.Consumer Healthcare, on the other hand, differs from Pfizer's two prescription medicine businesses, Pfizer said. The firm confirmed it's still mulling strategic alternatives for this unit. It expects to make a decision before the end of the year.""Trends in consumerism and an increased focus on staying healthy are causing consumers to seek easily accessible health and wellness solutions,"" the firm said. ""The company believes this business is well positioned to continue its growth.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

5,CELG,"Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) rocketed to a two-year high Friday after it and Celgene (CELG) reported strong results for a partnered anemia treatment called luspatercept.On the stock market today, Acceleron soared 42.8%, closing at 48.52. Celgene lifted 3.6%, to 79.42. Meanwhile, shares of other biotech companies rose. The ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology (BIB) exchange-traded fund lifted 3.5%, to 57.20.Late Thursday, the two biotech companies said luspatercept met both its key goals in a study. They tested luspatercept vs. a placebo in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. In these disorders blood cells are poorly formed or don't work well.The two biotech companies are now preparing the necessary documents to ask regulatory officials across the globe to approve luspatercept, Celgene Chief Medical Officer Jay Backstrom said in a written statement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This result from the Phase 3 (study called) Medalist demonstrates the potential clinical benefit of luspatercept as an erythroid (a red blood cell) maturation agent for the treatment of chronic anemia in patients with low-to-intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes,"" he said.Patients tested in the Medalist study had chronic anemia. Their disease also had progressed, or they were either intolerant or ineligible for another anemia treatment called an erythropoietin-stimulating agent, or ESA. Before luspatercept, they required frequent red blood cell transfusions.Luspatercept-treated patients experienced at least eight straight weeks without red blood cell transfusions during the first 24 weeks of treatment. The study also met its second goal. Patients were able to go at least 12 consecutive weeks without transfusions.Celgene and Acceleron will likely grab approval and launch in 2019, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a report to clients. He calls for worldwide sales of $170 million in 2020, increasing to $1.5 billion by 2023. Analysts, meanwhile, see $326 million and $1.2 billion, respectively.RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay boosted his expectations for luspatercept success to 95% from 90%. He calls for peak sales of $770 million in this specific patient group. Under the deal with Celgene, Acceleron will receive royalties on sales in the U.S.Though numerical details were lacking in the press release, this ""does not indicate lack of statically significant improvement,"" MacKay said in his note to clients. The biotech companies said they plan to offer more detail on the study at a future medical conference.Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster noted even reducing the frequency of transfusions for these patients would be an improvement, ""especially considering the lack of treatment options for patients with this condition.""Auster boosted his price target on Acceleron to 60 from 55. He sees a 90% likelihood luspatercept will get approval as an anemia treatment for this group of patients.The biotech companies also are considering testing luspatercept in low-to-intermediate risk patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who have never undergone ESA as an anemia treatment. Soon, the firms will also have data for luspatercept as a treatment for patients with beta-thalassemia.RBC's MacKay sees a ""high likelihood of success"" in using luspatercept to treat beta-thalassemia, a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin.

6,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) ""nailed it"" in the first quarter after delivering a broad beat-and-raise Friday, analysts said, but they questioned the timeline for the release of its key multiple sclerosis drug.Analysts were split on whether the first-quarter beat was enough to outweigh concerns about the MS drug, dubbed ozanimod. The Food and Drug Administration punted Celgene's application for ozanimod in February. Now, Celgene expects to refile for approval in early 2019.The ""modest beat fails to offset more development setbacks,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. But RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says the update on ozanimod is in line with expectations and ""should help diminish near-term uncertainty.""Investors rewarded Celgene, but it was short-lived. On the stock market today, Celgene rose as much as 4.1% before settling to a 1.7% gain at 86.89 by the close. Meanwhile, biotech stocks collectively lifted 1.3%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the first quarter, Celgene reported $3.54 billion in sales, rising 19% to top the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $3.5 billion. Adjusted profit of $2.05 a share beat the consensus for $2 and grew nearly 23%.Revenue from cancer drugs outperformed expectations. Revlimid brought in $2.23 billion, in line with the consensus and up 19%, Porges said. Pomalyst raked in $453 million, growing 24.5% to beat views by 3%. Abraxane generated $262 million, up 11% and topping by 6%.In immunology, sales of psoriasis and arthritis drug Otezla grew 46% to $353 million. That was 2% above the consensus, Porges said, but down 5% sequentially. In the U.S., increased demand and improved access helped spike sales, Celgene said in a news release.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said Celgene ""nailed it"" for an ""awesome quarter.""""All products came in line or beat slightly,"" he said in a note. ""Total product revenues beat by $100 million and the company slightly raised the 2018 guide on the top and bottom line.""Celgene also boosted its sales guidance for 2018 to $14.8 billion, up from earlier views for $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion. The firm also sees earnings of $8.45 a share, adjusted for the recent acquisition of Juno Therapeutics. Analysts had predicted $14.84 billion in sales and earnings of $8.44 a share.The big news, though, regarded ozanimod. In February, the FDA refused to file the application for ozanimod. Celgene cited deficiencies in the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections of the application for the FDA's decision.Earlier in the week, an analyst suggested that the issue came down to a specific substance within the drug, known as a metabolite. A metabolite is a substance formed in, or necessary for, metabolism. Celgene discovered this specific metabolite in later-stage testing in humans.RBC's Abrahams noted that this specific metabolite, known as CC112273, seems to stay in the body much longer than researchers initially realized. It's also responsible for about 90% of the drug's activity, he said in a report to clients.""However, the longer half-life should not be a major issue once the metabolite is characterized,"" he said. ""Other drugs in the class, like Gilenya, also have half-lives in similar ranges.""Now, Celgene expects to refile its application for ozanimod in multiple sclerosis in the first quarter of 2019. This timeline ""takes the uber bear case of a two-plus-year delay off the table,"" Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note.But it also means that Celgene's ozanimod, if approved, will be entering the market at about the same time as generic versions of Novartis' (NVS) rival drug Gilenya, Leerink's Porges said.""The new timeline is three quarters behind what we have forecast and may put the commercial launch in some uncertainty given the expected entry of generic Gilenya,"" he said. But he kept his outperform rating on Celgene stock.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

7,CELG,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) could win big after U.S. patent officials shut down a challenge facing Novartis' (NVS) multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, analysts said Thursday.On Wednesday, an appeals board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld a patent protecting Novartis' Gilenya until December 2027. This extends Gilenya's exclusivity well past a prior August 2019 expiration date, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said.While undoubtedly a win for Novartis, the decision also has implications for fellow multiple sclerosis drugmakers Celgene and Biogen (BIIB), he said in a report. Celgene recently suffered a delay for its multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.This gives Celgene more time to get approval for ozanimod — which is currently hamstrung by questions from the Food and Drug Administration — before a generic Gilenya comes out and begins to take share, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""For Celgene, this should provide a better ozanimod launch runway especially after their (new drug application) filing delay, and give Biogen less medium-term price/share compression risk for its MS franchise, particularly for (its drug called) Tecfidera,"" he said.On the stock market today, Celgene jumped 2.7%, to close at 85.60. Novartis advanced 3.4%, ending the session at 78.94. Biogen rose 1%, to 347.66.Generic competition in multiple sclerosis is already underway. In October, Mylan (MYL) gained approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone. In the first quarter, Teva said its U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 40% year over year.The same could happen for Novartis' Gilenya if generics arrive. Despite the patent appeals board decision, generic rivals will likely appeal, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. Gilenya could still lose patent protection at some point in 2022-24 depending on appeals.""In summary, ozanimod will no longer be launching vs. a generic Gilenya in 2019,"" he said in a report to clients. ""This gives ozanimod at least a three-year window to launch in a branded market and establish presence in MS.""RBC's Abrahams noted Celgene could benefit to the tune of $200 million in upside depending on the length of the delay for generic Gilenya.Ozanimod is meant to be a safer version of Gilenya. Both belong to a class of drugs called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, or S1P modulators. Gilenya is tied to heart rate and liver issues. Patients must be monitored after their first dose.""The attribute neurologists care most about in a next-generation S1P therapy is the absence of first-dose monitoring,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said. ""They also rank an advantage on liver enzyme impact pretty far down the list of comparative advantages they're looking for in an S1P vs. Gilenya.""It's not clear whether ozanimod will have a similar requirement. But Celgene management indicates ""the going assumption is that ozanimod won't avoid it,"" Raymond said in his note to clients.""As we see it, unless ozanimod can avoid first-dose monitoring, Celgene faces an uphill battle in its efforts to differentiate the molecule,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors Rich

8,CELG,"Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) stock jumped Tuesday after it and Celgene (CELG) reported a second win in as many weeks for their blood-disease drug called luspatercept.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Acceleron shares rose 2.9%, to 48.76, after earlier popping as much as 5.4%. Celgene advanced 0.9%, to 84.56. Shares of biotech companies broadly dipped less than 1%.Luspatercept could stoke more confidence in Celgene, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said. The firm's biggest cancer drug, Revlimid, will soon face a patent cliff. But Celgene is working other angles in cancer drugs. It acquired Juno Therapeutics and is partnered with Bluebird Bio (BLUE).""We view this as another positive development that, after recent successes with (Juno's drug called) JCAR017 and (Bluebird's drug called) bb2121, could begin to re-instill investor confidence in the pipeline beyond Revlimid not substantially reflected in shares at current levels,"" he said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe study, called Believe, tested luspatercept as a treatment for patients with beta thalassemia who are dependent on regular blood transfusions. These patients don't produce enough of a protein that carries oxygen throughout the body.Luspatercept showed a ""highly statistically significant"" improvement in red blood cell response. The goal was to reduce red blood cell transfusion burden by at least 33%. Researchers also looked for an absolute reduction of at least two transfusion units from week 13 to week 24 of the study.In addition, luspatercept also met all key secondary goals of the study. Side effects were consistent with previously reported data, the biotech companies said in a news release. The firms now plan to ask regulators in the U.S. and Europe to approve the drug in the first half of 2019.The news was largely expected. About two weeks ago, Celgene and Acceleron released positive data for luspatercept in another study. That late-stage test looked at the drug's ability to improve red blood cell response in patients with what are called myelodysplastic syndromes.Analysts had varied models on these two markets for luspatercept. Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster calls for $2 billion in peak sales for both disorders. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges sees $2.6 billion in peak 2025 sales for both uses.RBC's Abrahams models just $1.2 billion for luspatercept — a small fraction of the $12 billion in peak sales for Revlimid. But that could still help Celgene to fill its future Revlimid-shaped hole.""We see this, coupled with other positive pipeline developments for JCAR017 and bb2121 as putting the company (Celgene) on track to reach $10 billion in probability-adjusted sales for its current pipeline,"" he said.Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff was more bearish on partner Acceleron. He downgraded Acceleron stock to a neutral rating and cut his price target to 52 from 55.Tenthoff acknowledged the win for luspatercept but said Acceleron is ""not a buy at this valuation.""He sees sales of $20 million in 2020 after U.S. and European officials likely approve luspatercept. The biggest opportunity for the drug is in myelodysplastic syndromes where it could replace current, less effective therapies.But the tail will be short, Tenthoff said. Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are working on a potentially curative treatment for beta thalassemia. Their therapy could get approval by 2020, he said.""While not all patients will be appropriate for or able to afford gene therapy/CRISPR (a form of gene editing), we anticipate significant competitive pressure to impact Acceleron's market share,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

10,CELG,"Finding the best biotech companies to invest in can be tricky as volatility often pockmarks the space. Clinical plans don't always come to fruition and sometimes biotech stocks can suffer at the hands of regulatory decisions from the Food and Drug Administration.But the best biotech companies to invest in tend to have a commonality: A strong streak of earnings growth. As of June 2018, Investor's Business Daily's MarketSmith.com has two biotech stocks among a 150-strong list of the fastest growing stocks.Near the top of the list of fastest growing stocks, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) is ranked eighth. Over the past five years, its earnings per share have grown a massive 147%, compared to 319% for the top-earning stock, Momo (MOMO), a Chinese social media firm.Supernus has made a name for itself among biotech stocks. Though in terms of market cap it still trails bigger biotech companies like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG). But Supernus lands itself on the list you might consider as the best biotech companies to invest in for strong metrics. As always, do your research before buying any stock, and be sure to check the company's stock chart to make sure it's the right time to buy.It has several years of double-digit quarterly sales growth with drugs that help disorders of the central nervous system. Among those, Supernus counts epilepsy drugs Oxtellar XR (extended-release) and Trokendi XR.Trokendi XR is also approved to prevent migraines. It rivals drugs like Botox from Allergan (AGN) and Amgen's Aimovig.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) is unique among biotech stocks. Though IBD ranks it No. 144 out of 150 of the fastest growing stocks — which might put it on your research list for the possible best biotech companies to invest in — it doesn't market a single drug.Instead, Ligand acquires early-stage technologies necessary for drug development. It then licenses these platforms out to pharmaceutical companies like Dow Jones stocks Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE). As of June 2018, Ligand has a year of both double-digit sales and earnings growth under its belt.Ligand and Supernus both have IBD Composite Ratings of 99, meaning they perform in the top 1% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. The duo leads all other biotech stocks in terms of CR.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

11,CELG,"Roche (RHHBY) had mixed news Tuesday for cancer drug Tecentriq which succeeded in a lung cancer study with Celgene's (CELG) Abraxane but failed in a mashup with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Shares of Roche dipped to a 17-month low on the stock market today. Roche stock slid 0.7% to close at 27.20. Shares of Dow Jones component J&J declined 1.7% to 119.40, while Celgene lost 1% to 77.83. Broadly, stocks of pharmaceutical companies ticked up 0.2%.In one study, Roche tested Tecentriq plus chemotherapy — including Celgene's Abraxane — in patients with an advanced form of lung cancer. The regimen helped never-before-treated patients live significantly longer compared with chemo alone.The Tecentriq combination also reduced the risk of disease worsening or death compared with chemotherapy alone, Roche said in a news release.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut another piece of study news pockmarked Roche stock. J&J's Janssen unit terminated a study testing its drug Darzalex with Tecentriq in patients with an advanced type of lung cancer, according to a news release over the weekend. These patients were previously treated.The decision followed a review by an independent data monitoring committee which found ""no observed benefit"" for the regimen vs. Tecentriq alone. In addition, the committee noted a ""numerical increase"" in patient deaths among those who received the combination.Based on the findings, Janssen also decided to discontinue a study evaluating Darzalex with a drug similar to Tecentriq in patients with multiple myeloma. Janssen has a license from Genmab to develop, manufacture and commercialize Darzalex.""While we are disappointed that the studies will be discontinued, Genmab fully supports Janssen's decision as patient safety is paramount in drug development,"" Genmab Chief Executive Jan van de Winkel said in a prepared statement.RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

12,CELG,"The first half of 2018 has been a dichotomy between the haves and the have-nots among biotech companies, a Wall Street brokerage says.But in this case the haves aren't large-cap biotech companies like Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — all of which have struggled with negative clinical studies or regulatory delays for key drugs. Instead, it's the small- and midcap biotech companies that are leading the pack.RBC Capital Markets analysts call it ""a tale of two biotechs.""Multiples among large-cap biotech companies have slipped and sales projections have taken a beating. Meanwhile, prices for quality assets among small- and midcap biotech companies ""have never been higher and the competition fierce.""""Generalists who are able to hold smaller-cap companies are tending to invest in the (iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB)) rather than just a handful of large-caps,"" RBC wrote in a note to clients this week. ""In short, capital is being deployed into biotech — just primarily into the smaller-cap names.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology exchange-traded fund fell 2%, to 107.34. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) toppled 3.2%, to 93.62. Biotech stocks are now ranked No. 13 out of 197 industry groups IBD tracks, up from No. 30 just eight weeks ago.The struggles in the large-cap space for biotech companies have been well documented. The Street isn't entirely hopeful for one of Biogen's potential Alzheimer's disease treatments. Biogen is developing the drug called BAN2401 with Eisai.At the same time, other potential catalysts have left biotech stocks wanting. Clinical studies from Gilead, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Aimmune Therapeutics (AIMT) were ""anticlimactic,"" RBC analysts wrote.Celgene suffered a massive hit when the Food and Drug Administration delayed its experimental multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.The news is ""fueling continued questions about these companies' abilities to succeed in a second or third 'act' before their cash flows expire from patent cliffs,"" the RBC analysts said.They noted some biotech companies appear to have good launches for new drugs. They list Amgen's (AMGN) migraine prevention treatment Aimovig and Gilead's Biktarvy, an HIV medication. But even those aren't enough to offset underlying revenue issues, analysts say.Investors are seemingly taking a dim view for large-cap biotech stocks.""Our investor survey suggests worsening generalist sentiment with reticence to come back to the space, and our anecdotal feedback suggests frustration with challenges at companies like Celgene has led many to rotate out of the sector, through we sense a few may be looking to dip their toes back in,"" they wrote.However, the small- and midcap space ""could not be behaving more differently.""Innovation in gene therapy and cellular therapy resulted in the acquisitions this year. Novartis (NVS) bought AveXis and Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics.This is helping to send other ""cutting-edge"" biotech stocks like Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) and Sage Therapeutics (SAGE). Sarepta is now flying high on data from its gene therapy in a form of muscular dystrophy. Sage is working on a number of depression drugs.""In fact, 2018 biopharma M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity (in terms of dollars) has nearly tripled that seen up to mid-June 2017,"" the RBC analysts said. ""IPO (initial public offering) and secondary activity has remained vibrant with 23 biotech IPOs so far this year, raising $2.5 billion in aggregate.""Takeouts could occur among small- and midcap biotech companies. Analysts list Sage, Sarepta, BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), Exelixis (EXEL), Seattle Genetics (SGEN), Tesaro (TSRO), Clovis Oncology (CLVS), Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) and Alder Pharmaceuticals (ALDR) as potential targets.But even small- and midcap biotech stocks are walking a thin line, they said.""Being on the right side of catalysts (and M&A) will likely be key in the second half of 2018,"" the analysts said. ""Capital inflow could cool off as drug-pricing rhetoric potentially re-escalates going into the midterm elections and if any hiccups emerge among early-stage modalities (drugs).""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

13,CELG,"Today, it would be true to report many of the well-known large-cap biotech stocks are showing ""disappointing"" or ""downright awful"" performance in 2018. Just witness the damage lately in shares of Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).XIt would also be true to report that some companies in IBD's biotech industry group have been fantastic winners.Select gene therapy firms have been rising fast since breakouts in the second half of 2017. And blood disease expert Bioverativ, a Biogen spinoff, had a nice rally going before it soared 62% on Jan. 22. Make sure you see the big price gap in the accompanying chart below. Bioverativ soared in mammoth volume on news that it's being acquired by French pharmaceuticals titan Sanofi (SNY) for $11.6 billion.Could an investor have used good stock charts to find a breakout by Bioverativ before it made that giant single-day gain? Yes. Bioverativ crafted a double-bottom base, helping to set up the big move.If you don't use stock charts, you're trading at a disadvantage. Without charts, it's very tough to determine two keys about the market: 1) the current psychology of buyers and sellers; and 2) the balance of supply vs. demand in any given stock.When did Bioverativ break out? Jan. 9, while the stock market itself was in a confirmed uptrend. A confirmed uptrend is the best time to buy top-performing growth stocks. You have greater odds of making money when you invest with the larger trend.The specialist in therapies for hemophilia and rare blood disorders established an excellent prior uptrend, running from 44.98 on the close of its Feb. 2, 2017, market debut to a peak of 64.41 more than five months later. The stock corrected 16% in four weeks and carved out a three-month saucer with handle (1), but never broke out.Then Bioverativ really began to sell off.On Oct. 27, the midcap swooned 12% and hit as low as 50.50 (2). This created the first low in the base. In a proper double bottom, a stock will rebound back near its highs, then sell off a second time. And during that decline, the stock must undercut the first low.Why? You want to see an authentic shakeout of uncommitted shareholders. Find signs that shares move from weak hands to strong hands.The correct buy point? When the stock rises a dime over the middle peak in between the two lows.Bioverativ did exactly that. The stock rebounded up to 58.19, less than 3 points off the base's left-side peak of 60.74, then nose-dived again. This time, the sell-off took Bioverativ all the way to 48.28. A fine undercut of the first low (3).A double bottom forms over a minimum seven weeks. Corrections of more than, say, 30% to 33% are not ideal. The deeper the correction, the more a stock has to work just to get back to its highs.Look for signs of symmetry within the base. It should look like a ""W"" except that the second low undercuts the first.Bioverativ possessed all of these bullish traits in its 11-week double bottom. On Jan. 9, 2018, the stock gapped up 7%, surpassing the 58.29 buy point (middle peak of 58.19 plus 10 cents).  Volume gushed 75% above normal levels. Seven sessions later, Bioverativ traded at 64.11, up 10% from the proper entry, right before the acquisition news sent shares vaulting 62%.Prior to its breakout, the Waltham, Mass., firm notched quarterly earnings-per-share gains of 64%, 73% and 31%. Revenue had soared 317% in 2015, then rose another 58% and 32% the next two years.Expect double bottoms to proliferate among leading stocks when the major indexes fall furiously in several waves. Great market leaders built double bottoms and broke out after the bear markets in the fall of 1998, the fall of 2002, and other occasions.Sometimes you'll see a handle form on the double bottom. It's the market's way of presenting an additional buy point.(Sanofi completed its acquisition of Bioverativ on March 8. A version of this column was published on March 1, 2018. Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on the financial markets, growth companies, charts and stock breakouts.)RELATED:This Is The Golden Rule Of InvestingWhat Is The Current Stock Market Direction?

14,CELG,"Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) likely will seek a buyer after its Amgen (AMGN)-rivaling preventative migraine treatment gets approval, an analyst said Thursday as shares tanked on the hire of a new chief executive.Alder shares dropped 1.9% to 17.80 on the stock market today. Shares broke out of a cup base at an 18.70 buy point earlier in the week. But the rally was short-lived as the stock sank for three consecutive days.The biotech company hired Robert Azelby, former chief commercial officer at Juno Therapeutics, as its new chief executive. Celgene (CELG) recently acquired Juno, an immuno-oncology player. Before that, Azelby worked at Amgen where he managed the U.S. oncology business.But Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges sees Azelby's tenure as likely a short one.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The advantages of Mr. Azelby, in our view, are locality and availability, since he was already in Seattle and had presumably become available after the acquisition of Juno by Celgene,"" he said in a report to clients.He added: ""It's hard to believe that the board views Mr. Azelby as the long-term leader for this company, and the appointment adds to our conviction that the board will ultimately support a sale.""A sale is unlikely however until Alder gets approval for its preventative migraine treatment, known as a CGRP inhibitor. Amgen gained approval for its drug, Aimovig, in May. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are also working on similar drugs.Earlier this year, Alder's founder and former CEO Randall Schatzman unexpectedly stepped down. Alder had planned to submit its application for its migraine treatment in the second half of the year. Now, it expects to submit an application in the first quarter of 2019.The fact that Alder hired a new CEO isn't surprising, Porges said. ""But it is something of a surprise that the individual appointed to the position has no experience in neurology, and has not previously overseen the complex multi-functional elements of a product introduction,"" he said.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams, on the other hand, called the hire a ""sensible fit"" as Alder moves toward its commercial stage. Azelby brings significant experience in commercial strategy across large and small biotechs, and biopharma, he said.""We believe all of this will be important in launching (preventative migraine treatment) eptinezumab,"" he said in a note. ""We understand he has also been closely involved in regulatory processes at his prior organizations, experience which can help with eptinezumab's (application) filing.""RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

15,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) toppled to a four-year low Thursday after it appeared on a list from the Food and Drug Administration that tried to ""shame"" drugmakers working to block generic competition.Some pharmaceutical and biotech companies are ""gaming"" the system by limiting access to their drugs for generic rivals needing to do equivalence studies, the FDA said. Analysts, though, expect the so-called ""shame list"" to have little more than a headline impact on these companies.In total, Celgene received 31 inquiries for samples of drugs Revlimid, Pomalyst and Thalomid. All three have Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, programs to ensure the benefits of the drugs outweigh the risks. These drugs have certain distribution requirements.Celgene reportedly said any biotech companies wanting to access these drugs would need to follow specific rules. The biotech said it already has provided samples to companies that fulfilled these requirements, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""As such, while Celgene might be putting up an understandably high barrier, we believe generic companies willing to put in the appropriate safeguards have already been able to obtain Revlimid to conduct bioequivalence studies,"" he said in a note to clients.The inclusion of Celgene on the list is unlikely to speed along generic competition for Revlimid, Williams said. As of now, the drug is ""gated more by (intellectual property) than regulatory questions,"" he said.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed agreed. Celgene is already working through generic litigation regarding Revlimid. Analysts expect copycat drugs in 2022.""We believe this is more modest headline risk than actual business risk,"" he said in his report.On the stock market today, Celgene shares dipped 1.7%, to close at 79.98. They earlier slipped to a low last seen in June 2014. Meanwhile, collective shares of biotech and pharmaceutical companies each lifted a fraction.Other key drugs listed include Biogen's (BIIB) multiple sclerosis medicine Tecfidera, as well as Gilead Sciences' Letairis and Truvada. Letairis treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and Truvada treats HIV.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay notes the FDA also included BioMarin Pharmaceutical's (BMRN) Kuvan. Kuvan treats a condition associated with an elevated amino acid. BioMarin shares dipped 1.4%, near 88.30.Still, BioMarin has already settled with several general pharmaceutical companies for generic entry after the patent expires in 2020.""Further, while the FDA's (list) publicizes efforts to prevent generic entry, no actual policy has been put in place to deter or diminish the strategies branded manufacturers employ to limit access to branded drugs,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

17,CELG,"Amgen's (AMGN) future among biotech companies could be in trouble, an analyst said Tuesday.The No. 1 company in its sector trades at a premium to biotech companies Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB), but its pipeline contains fewer blockbuster opportunities. Meanwhile, generic and biosimilar competition is hacking away at a $15 billion chunk of its revenue, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.Investors have been rewarding Amgen for its share repurchase programs and steady cash flows. But it lacks long-term stability. Generally, investors look for biotech companies with unpriced optionality in their pipelines. Amgen doesn't have that.""In Amgen's case, the inability to identify which programs might offer that upside, particularly for a company of this size, reinforces our belief that Amgen must commit to significant business development activity to expand its portfolio or its pipeline,"" Porges said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePorges estimates 65% of Amgen's portfolio is likely to steadily decline. Some of its biggest moneymakers — Epogen, Aranesp, Neupogen, Neulasta and Enbrel — are facing rivalries. The growth potential of new and acquired products isn't enough to offset declines in these franchises.Epogen and Aranesp treat anemia. Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) just gained approval to make a copy of Epogen/Procrit. Novartis (NVS) also has a copycat of Neupogen, a bone marrow stimulant.Blockbusters Neulasta and Enbrel are also at risk. Neulasta also stimulates bone marrow. Enbrel treats some chronic diseases, including forms of arthritis and psoriasis. Novartis already has a copycat of Enbrel. Novartis, Mylan (MYL) and Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) are working to copy Neulasta.In response, Amgen has restructured its expense base, initiated a dividend and levered up the company's balance sheet, Porges said.But, ""compared to peers, we regard Amgen as a more defensive stock, but also one lacking the explosive upside potentially typically associated with breakthrough or rapidly growing bio-therapeutic stocks,"" he said.Porges sees Amgen as worth about $130 billion or 194 per share, which is about 10% above the most recent closing price. He has a market perform rating and 210 price target on Amgen stock. On the stock market today, shares rose 1.1% to close at 178.36. Shares of biotech companies lifted a fraction.""The most concerning conclusion of this analysis is the lack of opportunity in Amgen's pipeline outside the elements in our (sum-of-the-parts),"" he said. Celgene and Biogen, on the other hand, have ""greater pipeline optionality and growth prospects.""Eventually, the firm will have to engage in smart mergers and acquisitions, Porges said. The best mergers and acquisitions will pivot away from Amgen's challenged legacy products to mid- to late-stage pipeline opportunities to build on its revenue projections for 2020-30.It's possible the biotech could be interested in a ""merger of equals.""As it stands, ""the company's current pipeline is either very early or has shared economics, and thus is unlikely to meaningfully alter the outlook for an about $120 billion company with current revenue of $23 billion per year,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

18,CELG,"Wall Street was split Wednesday on Celgene (CELG) as one sell-side analyst downgraded the stock saying it ""has tilted to greater risk"" while another upgraded shares of the beleaguered biotech company.On the stock market today, Celgene shares gained 1.4% to close at 77.66. But shares crumbled to a four-year low on Monday on a report its head of business development exited in April. Shares of biotech companies rose a fraction.On Wednesday, Argus analyst David Toung downgraded Celgene to hold rating from buy. But, at the same time, analysts with Sanford C. Bernstein upgraded the stock to an outperform rating from market perform, reportedly saying its valuation is too cheap to ignore.Toung, though, is concerned about the longevity of cancer drug Revlimid. Generic pharmaceutical companies like Mylan (MYL) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) are vying to make copycats of Revlimid. Revlimid's patents extend until 2024 in the U.S. and 2027 in Europe.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""If one or more Revlimid patents are invalidated, broad generic competition could begin before 2023,"" he said in a report to clients.That would be devastating for Celgene, which brought in $8.19 billion in Revlimid sales in 2017. To contend, Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics. Juno's leading drug candidate, a cancer treatment, could bring in up to $3 billion in peak-year sales, but Toung doesn't expect a commercial launch for 18 months.Celgene also put down $1.1 billion to acquire Impact Biomedicines, which has an experimental cancer drug. The firm plans to file for approval of its key drug in mid-2018. It's also working with Bluebird Bio (BLUE) on a multiple myeloma treatment.""While these pipeline assets are promising, their combined potential revenue is not enough to completely replace Revlimid, in our view,"" Toung said.Toung's assessment follows a Food and Drug Administration list that attempts to ""shame"" several pharmaceutical companies for blocking generic competition for big drugs. Among large biotech companies the FDA also lists Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB).Celgene has also had a number of missteps in recent history. Last October, it scrapped studies of a drug called GED-301 as a Crohn's disease treatment. In February, the FDA said it wouldn't review a drug called ozanimod in multiple sclerosis. That drug is now delayed by at least a year.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top? Easy: Look For Heavy DistributionInvesting Basics: How To Sell A StockSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

19,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) tanked by nearly 8% late Tuesday after the Food and Drug Administration refused to file its application for a multiple sclerosis treatment called ozanimod, citing deficiencies in the paperwork.Upon preliminary review, the FDA determined the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections of the application were insufficient to review. Celgene said in a statement it plans to seek guidance, including requesting a meeting with the FDA.Ozanimod, which is being developed to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, is ""one of the most, if not the most, important pipeline programs for Celgene,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.A refusal-to-file letter can sometimes require administrative tweaks and refiling, or could mean a company has to perform additional clinical studies, Abrahams said. In Celgene's case, it's hard now to know how material the setback for ozanimod is.""Any meaningful delay could impact the drug's ultimate potential (we currently have $5 billion in peak sales in our model) given the competitive multiple sclerosis (where generic Gilenya could be disruptive if launched prior to ozanimod approval) and inflammatory bowel disorder spaces,"" he said.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Celgene plunged 7.8% near 88.30, after the stock finished the regular session down nearly 1%, at 95.78.RELATED:These Biotechs Diverge After Biggest Moneymakers Lag ExpectationsVeeva Rockets After Topping Quarterly Estimates, Crushing Guidance ViewsTesaro Dives After Missing Fourth-Quarter Expectations

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmong other biotech stocks and pharmaceutical companies, AbbVie is expected to report data from a study of its drug, upadacitinib. Researchers are looking at the drug as a treatment for forms of arthritis.Further, the Food and Drug Administration likely will decide whether to approve AbbVie's drug called Elagolix as a treatment for endometriosis, a condition of the female reproductive system. The FDA will also decide the fate of a drug dubbed Venclexta in a form of leukemia.Stock market trackers also expects Celgene to unveil data from late-stage studies of Revlimid and luspatercept. Celgene partners with Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) on luspatercept in two blood diseases. Revlimid is Celgene's major cancer drug.Celgene could also reveal more about its Juno Therapeutics acquisition, through which it is moving into a class of cancer therapy known as CAR-T, short for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. There, it competes with Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).""Data from CAR-T development updates should define the path forward for these products (Revlimid and luspatercept),"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in the note.Porges also expects the FDA to make a decision on Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent as an asthma treatment. Physicians can already use Dupixent to treat eczema. The duo also has cemiplimab, which the FDA is considering in an advanced form of skin cancer.In addition, Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI) is working on a drug dubbed lumateperone as a schizophrenia treatment. Analysts will focus on whether the FDA accepts the application for approval based on ""mixed Phase 3 data,"" Porges said.""Intra-Cellular will also report topline data from the ongoing Phase 3 study in bipolar depression in the second half, as they look for a second indication for lumateperone,"" he said.Porges expects Zogenix (ZGNX) to have data for a late-stage study of its drug, ZX008.

22,CELG,"Biotech stocks and pharmaceutical companies added to recent market gains Monday after Trump's top health aide delivered a speech that largely spared them the brunt of drug-pricing reform.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar delivered his speech on drug-pricing reform Monday. Like Trump, his speech was light on its impact for biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies. Instead, the White House is considering changes to Medicare and caps on out-of-pocket spending.Most proposals will impact so-called middlemen including pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs and drug distributors. They include the likes of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC). But Azar was critical of pharmaceutical companies' high list prices and a lack of transparency in direct-to-consumer advertising.""We look forward to working with industry to build a better system,"" he said. ""But if industry isn't willing to work with us to lower prices, President Trump and his administration will keep turning up the pressure — until the system finally puts American patients first.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseShares of pharmaceutical companies had rallied but ultimately slipped marginally at the close while biotech company stocks gained 1.2% on the stock market today following the speech. The Nasdaq Biotechnology (NBI) was flat while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) index rose 1%.Among the proposals, RBC analysts see changes to Medicare Part B and Part D as having the biggest impact on biotech stocks. Still, they wrote in a note to clients even that will still be ""relatively benign overall.""Part B covers physician-administered drugs whereas Part D covers prescription drugs. Under the proposal, negotiation from some Part B drugs would be more similar to Part D negotiation. More broadly, the president is calling for Part B to merge into Part D, Azar said.""Inflation-capped price increases in Part B is likely most impactful proposal in biotech, as well as out-of-pocket transparency for Part B vs. Part D drugs (infusions vs. self-injectables) and unifying Part B billing codes,"" RBC analysts said.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) has the largest exposure among large-cap biotechs to Part B through its eye disease drug called Eylea. Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Amgen (AMGN) also are exposed. Further, Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Dynavax (DVAX) face difficulties.Azar also suggested changes to how PBMs issue and negotiate rebates. He proposed an end so-called ""gag clauses"" on pharmacists. These prevent pharmacists from telling consumers when they'd actually save money by paying out of pocket for their medicines.""Right now, we're asking a pretty straightforward question: What if, instead of the current system where drug companies get paid rebates and middlemen take a cut, we just had fixed-price discounts?"" Azar said. ""This would fix the situation where even the pharmacy benefit manager, who is hired to help keep prices low, makes money from higher list prices.""He also suggested pharmaceutical companies include their list prices in advertising that goes out directly to consumers. Further, Azar said he and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are developing incentives to lower list prices.But most of these changes are long-term ""further actions,"" Raymond James analyst Michael Baker said in a note. Changes to Part D contracts that prevent pharmacists from explaining when out-of-pocket costs are cheaper ""will likely not have a meaningful impact.""RELATED:Biotech Stocks Fly As Trump Speech Seen As 'More Bark Than Bite'Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

24,CELG,"In a rapid turnaround, Allergan (AGN) said late Thursday it doesn't intend to bid on Shire (SHPG) — leaving thrice-rebuffed Takeda Pharmaceuticals alone in the race for the rare disease drugmaker.The entire saga erupted early Thursday when reports emerged Allergan might be interested in buying Shire. About the same time, Shire confirmed it had rejected three bids from Takeda with one worth north of $61 billion.Allergan first said it was in the early stages of a potential bid on Shire. Hours — and a stock plunge later — Allergan said it definitively won't make an offer to take over Shire. Meanwhile, it's still ""evaluating a full range of potential strategic options,"" Allergan said in a news release.Shares of Allergan closed down 4.2%, at 158.59, and were flat in after-hours trading on the stock market today. Shire sank 1.1%, to 160.74 at the closing bell.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeculation about a Shire-Takeda merger has been swirling since late March. Since then, Takeda has made three bids on Shire. In each case, Shire's board determined the bids ""significantly undervalue"" the firm's growth prospects and pipeline.Takeda confirmed it put forth a buyout bid for Shire worth about $66 per share, comprised of cash and stock. Both firms say they are willing to continue negotiating. Still, Takeda is confident it ""remains well positioned"" even if negotiations fall through.""Building on Takeda's existing momentum, the acquisition of Shire would accelerate its transformation and result in a global, value-based R&D-driven biopharmaceutical leader headquartered in Japan,"" Takeda said in a prepared statement.The short-lived interest from Allergan came as a surprise, Leerink analyst Etzer Darout said in a note. The firm has said it could become acquisitive and is looking at strategic options.""A combination with Shire introduces some growth challenges in out-years, which are reflected in the negative stock reaction,"" he said.Shire is likely to face erosion of attention deficit hyperactivity medicine Vyvanse beginning in 2023 and significant erosion of its hemophilia business as it competes with rival Roche (RHHBY). Allergan would have had to justify the bid to its shareholders, he said.The Shire interest comes amid a flurry of biotech acquisitions that kicked off earlier this year when Celgene (CELG) announced its plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi (SNY) unveiled plans to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).Novartis (NVS) sold its share of GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) consumer health unit for $13 billion and used part of the proceeds to fund its $8.7 billion plan to acquire AveXis (AVXS). Merck KGaA agreed to sell its over-the-counter unit to Proctor & Gamble (PG), days after it was rumored Mylan (MYL) might buy it.Earlier this week, Shire said it would sell it cancer unit to France's Servier for $2.4 billion.Analysts have speculated that Celgene could also be on the lookout for more acquisitions with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) and Jounce Therapeutics (JNCE) as potential targets. Amgen (AMGN) also has a huge war chest and is facing competition for its older medicines.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

25,CELG,"Prothena (PRTA) jumped to a seven-week high Wednesday on a $150 million collaboration deal with Celgene (CELG) that could result in treatments for Alzheimer's disease, palsy and encephalopathy, an analyst said.The collaboration, announced late Tuesday, will focus on treatments targeting three proteins called tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed substance. Prothena's work is largely in diseases tied to misfolded protein, in which the protein structure is incorrect.Tau has been tied to Alzheimer's, forms of palsy and dementia, and a degenerative brain disease, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said in a report. TDP-43 is indicated in a group of neurological diseases as well as forms of dementia and Alzheimer's.""We view today's announced collaboration with Celgene as external validation of Prothena's internal expertise and the company's potential as an R&D machine,"" MacKay said.

Biotech stocks broadly lifted 0.6%.Under the terms of the deal, Celgene will pay Prothena $100 million upfront and make a $50 million equity investment in the smaller biotech, at a 25.8% premium to Prothena's closing price on Tuesday.The cash infusion will help limit downside before Prothena unveils the results of a trial in mid-2018, MacKay said. The trial is evaluating a drug called NEOD001 as a treatment for a disease in which protein deposits throughout the body cause systemic damage.""However, we anticipate outcomes from upcoming NEOD001 trials will likely be viewed as a read-through across Prothena's R&D platforms in both positive and negative scenarios,"" he said.Instinet analyst Christopher Marai expects the Celgene collaboration to accelerate Prothena's neurodegenerative pipeline development and sees the firm filing applications each year with U.S. regulators to begin new clinical trials.Marai reiterated a buy rating on Prothena and kept his 87 price target.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersWhich Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

27,CELG,"Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) gapped up by nearly a third Tuesday after its ulcerative colitis drug proved strong in a Phase 2 trial, less than a month after U.S. regulators delayed a similar drug from Celgene (CELG).On the stock market today, Arena rocketed 28.7% to close at 39.75, after earlier rising as much as 43.6%. Celgene, on the other hand, dipped 0.3% to close at 88.27, as analysts suggested Arena's drug could be stronger than Celgene's.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said it's hard to compare the drugs. Arena has data for its drug etrasimod as a 2-milligram dose at 12 weeks of treatment whereas similar data for Celgene's ozanimod is as a 1-milligram dose at eight and 12 weeks.But etrasimod ""seems to look an awful lot like ozanimod,"" Raymond said in a report to clients. ""These data appear similar, and even slightly advantageous for Arena.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBoth drugs belong to a class called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators, or S1P, which are being tested in a number of inflammatory conditions. Last month, U.S. regulators said they wouldn't consider Celgene's application to use ozanimod to treat multiple sclerosis, citing deficiencies in the paperwork.Etrasimod was measured on a scale called the Mayo Clinic Score, which ranges from 0-9, and consists of stool frequency, rectal bleeding and endoscopy findings. In patients who received the 2-milligram dose, there was a 0.99-point improvement vs. a placebo.Based on the same scale, 33% of patients treated with 2-milligram etrasimod achieved clinical remission vs. 8.1% for the placebo group. On a four-component scale, 24.5% of patients in the same etrasimod group were in remission vs. 6% of placebo patients. Safety was key for the trial, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said.Investors were looking for etrasimod to lack cardiac effects, he said. But two patients in the 2-milligram dose group developed a type of heart block. Both resolved shortly after emergence, though one patient eventually discontinued the trial for other reasons.""Management emphasized that the effect on the (atrioventricular) node is a known on-target phenomenon and that the profile of etrasimod is still far cleaner than ozanimod or other S1PR modulators,"" he said.Schwartz raised his expectations for etrasimod to succeed to 45% from 30%. He also boosted his price target on Arena to 63 from 56 and kept his outperform rating.Arena said it plans to move etrasimod into Phase 3 testing, though the company didn't offer a timeline for that. Mizuho analyst Salim Syed noted a Phase 3 study of ozanimod in ulcerative colitis was pushed back a year due to slower enrollment.""If the drugs are fairly similar and ozanimod gets approved in ulcerative colitis (could happen in 2020), Arena may have to compete with an approved drug on the market,"" he said.

Key rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) dipped on the news.And Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) hit its lowest closure point since June 2013 on a CNN story detailing deaths in patients taking its only approved drug, Nuplazid. Nuplazid treats psychosis in patients with Parkinson's disease, and is being tested in an array of other conditions.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNovartis agreed to pay $218 per share of AveXis in an offer that represents an 88% premium to where AveXis closed on Friday. The deal is a 72% premium to AveXis' 30-day volume-weighted average stock price, AveXis said in a news release.AveXis is developing AVXS-101, a gene therapy treatment for spinal muscular atrophy diagnosed in young children. The drug would rival Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis' Spinraza, which is already approved to treat the condition. Biogen stock, though, fell a fraction, to 257.52, though rose 1% in extended trading.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams credited the deal for ""breathing life into (the) sector,"" in a note. The biotech group has been under pressure recently. Shares sank to as much as a two-month low on Friday, but collectively advanced 3.2% on Monday.This ""could be the (mergers and acquisitions) kick-start that the sector has awaited in our view,"" he said. ""There has been anticipation, but no major deal and trepidation on drug pricing and risk-highlighting negative catalysts (have kept) sentiment down of late.""The transaction is expected to close midyear. The price will go up to $225 per share of AveXis stock if Novartis decides to extend the close date to Oct. 6. If AveXis terminates the deal, it will owe Novartis a $284 million fee. If Novartis terminates the deal, it owes AveXis $437 million.PTC Therapeutics (PTCT) jumped 1.9%, to 26.18, on the news. PTC is in the early stages of making a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, alongside Roche (RHHBY).""While this asset remains early, it has shown early positive signals, and we could see increased attention today given the value that Big Pharma is clearly willing to place on SMA assets once they are further de-risked,"" RBC's Abrahams said.Immuno-oncology drug Keytruda significantly outperformed chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer, Merck said in a news release. The study, dubbed Keynote-042, tested Keytruda as a single drug vs. chemo in patients who have the PD-L1 protein in at least 1% of their tumor cells.The study examined overall survival. Interim analysis shows Keytruda kept patients alive longer than chemotherapy as lone treatments. Safety was in line with earlier studies. Merck will now continue the study to determine Keytruda's impact on progression-free survival.Patients who have PD-L1 protein in 1%-49% of their tumors represent 10%-15% of the overall market in lung cancer, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note. Bristol's rival drug, Opdivo, failed to improve progression-free survival in patients with PD-L1 in at least 5% of their tumors, he noted.Bristol shares touched an eight-month low in intraday trading on the news but recovered somewhat and closed down 0.7%, at 60.48.AbbVie (ABBV) ran up 0.8%, to 90.48, and rose another 1.2% after hours, after its investigational drug upadacitinib beat its own blockbuster Humira in a study of rheumatoid arthritis patients.Patients received either 15 milligrams of upadacitinib daily, 40 milligrams of Humira every other week, or a placebo. AbbVie examined patients at week 12 for at least a 20% improvement in rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and clinical remission.The study showed 71% of upadacitinib patients experienced a 20% improvement in symptoms vs. 63% and 36% of Humira and placebo patients, respectively. Of upadacitinib patients, 29% were in clinical remission vs. 18% and 6% of Humira and placebo patients.""We are excited by these strong results, which add to the body of evidence that support the potential of upadacitinib to be an important treatment option for patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"" AbbVie spokesperson Michael Severino said in a prepared statement.Rumors emerged that Celgene could be eyeing takeovers of Agios or Jounce Therapeutics (JNCE). Agios popped and Jounce surged 7%, to 19.78. A buyout would follow Celgene's recent acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, a cancer biotech.The report emerged from the Financial Times, which cited unnamed sources. Celgene is reportedly ""hunting for acquisition targets with promising drugs"" to offset the loss of patent protection for its key blockbuster, Revlimid.Celgene already partners with Agios and Jounce, both of which are working on cancer drugs. Agios has a market cap of $4.6 billion, eclipsing Jounce's market cap, which remains under $1 billion. Jounce went public last year.In similar news, Ionis and AstraZeneca announced a partnership to develop a drug to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Under the terms of the deal, AstraZeneca will pay Ionis a $30 million license fee to take over responsibility for the development and commercialization of the drug.As the drug advances, Ionis is also eligible to receive up to $300 million in additional development and regulatory milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties up to the low teens on sales of the drug.Ionis stock advanced 2.3%, to 41.61, as AstraZeneca lifted 1.4%, to 35.90, at the close.Menlo Therapeutics (MNLO) and Acadia were among the biggest biotech stock losers on Monday. Shares of Menlo tanked 76.8%, falling to 8.17, just three months after going public. The stock had been forming a cup with handle with a 38.92 buy point. Shares rose 2% after hours.The tumble followed news on Sunday that Menlo's itching drug failed in an eczema study. Menlo found no statistically significant differences between its drug, serlopitant, and a placebo. Chief Executive Steve Basta noted there were still signs of improvement for serlopitant-treated patients.Serlopitant is also being tested in another skin condition known as prurigo nodularis, itching associated with psoriasis and chronic cough. The setback in eczema doesn't necessarily hurt Menlo's chances for serlopitant in prurigo nodularis, Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said in a note.""After all, prurigo nodularis is an altogether different condition,"" he said. ""The larger point here is that Menlo decided to run a broad clinical program in (itching) in order to have a handful of potential pathways to market for serlopitant.""Amsellem kept his overweight rating on Menlo.Meanwhile, Acadia dived 23.4%, to 16.50, on a CNN story outlining deaths in Parkinson's patients who took Nuplazid for psychosis.Nuplazid was approved in 2016 to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's. After its approval, patients continued to experience hallucinations and side effects including death, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue, CNN wrote.Since its approval, more than 700 patients on Nuplazid have died. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medicine listed as ""suspect"" in at least 500 death reports. Acadia, though, notes that two studies have shown no difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and a placebo.The drug is Acadia's only approved medicine.

29,CELG,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) viral franchises look strong heading into first-quarter earnings season, but fellow large caps Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG) are on shakier ground, an analyst said Wednesday.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams calls for Gilead to top expectations, with Biogen likely to miss on the bottom line. Celgene, still reeling from the sudden departure of its chief operating officer, is typically weak in the first period.But clinical studies and business development are more important in biotech, he said.""We believe clinical trial successes and increased mergers-and-acquisitions activity will be more important to help improve sentiment given renewed drug pricing, competitive and life-cycle concerns across the sector,"" he said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGilead gained 2.2% to close at 75.40, while Biogen climbed 2.2% to 272.40. Celgene jumped 4.2% to 90. 47 on a possible rebound after dropping in the wake of the sudden and unexplained departure of its chief operating officer. COO Scott Smith left late last week.Up 2.8% for the day, the biotech group was ranked first just 26 weeks ago and fifth as recently as eight weeks ago. It's now slipped to No. 11 out of 197 groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. Shares hit a 30-month high in March but have since toppled about 12% from that point.Abrahams calls for a strong quarter for Gilead. HIV drugs are becoming more important to the firm's top line and the hepatitis C market is stabilizing.More HIV patients are using regimens that contain a drug known as tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF. Among those, Abrahams sees Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey beating expectations and taking share from its own Atripla and Stribild.Biktarvy, a three-drug treatment for HIV, is still early into its launch. It's expected to bring in $47 million in the first quarter, and ""sales look to be tracking ahead of the consensus projecting out longer term, in 2019,"" he said.Hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Epclusa are seen beating views for $923 million. Abrahams models $1.02 billion for the two drugs. That's despite competition from AbbVie's (ABBV) new drug Mavyret, which treats a wide group of hepatitis C patients.""If the franchises perform as we expect, we could see an 8-cent bottom-line beat in the first quarter and earnings per share tracking to exceed the consensus for the year — which we believe would help drive upside as the pipeline matures and visibility increases into earnings growth in the out years,"" he said.Abrahams has an outperform rating on Gilead shares.Biogen looks ""generally solid"" for the first quarter. Abrahams expects $3.13 billion in sales to be slightly below the consensus for $3.15 billion based on prescription trends. He expects earnings per share to come in 8 cents below the consensus.Multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera is experiencing steady erosion. But Celgene's experimental drug ozanimod has been delayed in multiple sclerosis. Meanwhile, revenue from spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza is likely to be in line.""With multiple sclerosis contracts for 2018 secured, key competitor ozanimod delayed and a temporary lull in competitive spinal muscular atrophy news flow, we expect the focus of the call to be on potential out-year growth drivers,"" he said.The biotech is expected to outline plans for aducanumab, which is being tested in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen made some changes to its studies for the drug. Investors also are likely to key in on potential acquisition talk.""We expect shares to trade in-line pending more clarity on the long-term picture,"" he said. Abrahams boosted his price target to 330 from 316. He has a sector perform rating on the stock.The first quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Celgene, ""though we believe it should be solid enough to allay any concerns emerging following the departure of their president/chief operating officer,"" Abrahams said.Abrahams boosted his expectations for inflammation drug Otezla to $346 million in the first quarter and $1.63 billion for the year — in line with consensus views. Otezla sales have been a source of pain in the past, widely missing in the third period before rebounding in the fourth.But Abrahams lowered views for Pomalyst, an anti-cancer drug, ""to reflect weaker-than-expected use patterns"" and the likelihood of indirect erosion from Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Darzalex.Investor focus will be on the next steps for ozanimod after U.S. regulators rejected the drug in multiple sclerosis. Celgene could also offer up further details for Acceleron Pharma (XLRN)-partnered luspatercept in blood diseases.Abrahams cut his price target to 120 from 131.

31,CELG,"Nike fueled a big rally in the Dow Jones Friday as major stock indexes looked poised to end the second quarter on a high note.Biotech stocks in the Nasdaq 100 outperformed with names like Vertex (VRTX), Celgene (CELG) and BioMarin (BMRN) up nicely. Shares of Vertex soared 14% after a competing cystic fibrosis drug from Galapagos (GLPG) didn't do well in a mid-stage trial.The Dow was up 0.9% near midday; the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.7% and 0.5% respectively. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking lower than Thursday's levels.In stock market results today, Nike (NKE) was the hands-down winner in the Dow after the company reported strong earnings late Thursday.

A flattening yield curve hasn't been good news for the financials in recent weeks.

American Express increased its dividend 11% to 39 cents.

33,CELG,"A German biotech with the potential to rival Gilead Sciences (GILD), Novartis (NVS) and Celgene (CELG) in cancer drugs is looking to raise $150 million in a Nasdaq initial public offering, according to a recent filing.MorphoSys filed its registration statement in the U.S. on Thursday. It hasn't yet priced the IPO, but in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing said it plans to raise $150 million. That would help line its coffers as MorphoSys plows ahead with a late-stage oncology drug.The firm's late-stage treatment would rival approved drugs called CAR-T therapies, which aim to teach a patient's immune system to identify and fight cancer. Novartis and Gilead crossed the finish line last year with CAR-T treatments called Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.Kymriah is used to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger. Novartis is also seeking approval for Kymriah in a disease called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where Gilead's Yescarta is already approved.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLike Kymriah and Yescarta, MorphoSys' drug called MOR208 targets an antigen called CD19. Unlike Kymriah and Yescarta, MOR208 isn't a CAR-T drug; it belongs to a class called monoclonal antibodies. It's being developed to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.MorphoSys recently unveiled strong results for MOR208 in combination with lenalidomide, sold by Celgene under the brand name Revlimid, in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The trial is still ongoing, MorphoSys said in a news release earlier this month.Preliminary results show patients achieved a median progression-free survival rate of 50.4% after 12 months of treatment. Overall, 49% of patients responded to the regimen with 31% having a complete response. The regimen was also well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities.In earlier-stage testing, MorphoSys is also working on a therapy for multiple myeloma called MOR202. This could rival drugs from Celgene — via Celgene's acquisition of Juno Therapeutics. Celgene is looking at CAR-T treatments for multiple myeloma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other blood cancers.The German biotech also has developed and licensed a drug to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) being investigated in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, an eczema drug in development with partner Galapagos (GLPG), and another drug being looked at for its anti-tumor properties.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

34,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) could go private in 2019 to avoid volatility as key cancer drug Revlimid begins to lose patent protection in the mid-2020s, an analyst suggested Wednesday.A leveraged buyout at a 30% premium would be a ""theoretical win-win for all parties,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note. He assumes the deal would be financed with 70% debt and 30% equity at a 6% blended interest rate.Celgene is in a tough position. It's the third biggest biotech by market cap, valued at $69.4 billion. But shares are down 12% year to date. Its top two drugs, Revlimid and Pomalyst — both cancer treatments — are set to lose exclusivity in the mid-2020s.""We model a takeout occurring in 2019 and the company being spun back out to the public markets in 2024 at which point we would expect more go-forward earnings stability as Pomalyst would be off-patent and Revlimid partially off patent,"" he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGoing private would allow Celgene to capture the value of Revlimid cash flows before the patent cliff that aren't being appreciated by the public, Abrahams said.The move would also help Celgene avoid volatility as it works through Revlimid litigation and settlements, and pipeline developments including refiling for approval of multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod, which has been delayed by U.S. regulators.Further, Celgene could reduce some of its general and administrative costs.""A buyer could gain shares at a significant discount,"" he said. ""Current shareholders could see an immediate premium to the stock price many believe could be difficult to achieve until the stock re-rates again, timing for which may be unpredictable.""Multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod, anemia drug luspatercept and multiple myeloma drug bb2121 are key to Celgene's success. On luspatercept, Celgene is partnered with Acceleron Pharma (XLRN). Bb2121 is being developed with Bluebird Bio (BLUE).But a buyout could be unrealistic, Abrahams said. Leveraged buyouts greater than $10 billion are rare and the largest ever was $50 billion. The deal would likely have to be creative and involve Big Pharma involvement.Getting Celgene's board to accept a modest 25%-30% premium ""is no sure thing."" And a merger would compromise Celgene's corporate culture, research and development capabilities, and ""reputation as a partner of choice.""On the stock market today, Celgene ticked up 5 cents to close at 91.61. Biotech stocks were collectively down a fraction, though the group is ranked fifth out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.RELATED:How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

36,CELG,"Amgen (AMGN) would be better off stringing together small deals, rather than attempting a megamerger with the likes of Celgene (CELG), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) or AstraZeneca (AZN), an analyst suggested Monday.One of the biggest debates on the stock is what Amgen will do with its war chest of cash from tax reform, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said in a note to clients. At the end of 2017, Amgen had $41.7 billion in cash and investments. Young sees Amgen having $35 billion in cash.""We think the maximum deal size that Amgen could finance without raising equity would be $40 billion to $50 billion,"" she said. ""Amgen could buy similar amounts of revenue growth significantly cheaper from a series of small cap deals vs. a large cap.""For just $15 billion, Amgen could buy Puma Biotechnology (PBYI), Tesaro (TSRO) and AnaptysBio (ANAB) to achieve a 5% compound annual growth rate from 2019-22 on a pro-forma basis. AstraZeneca would cost $110 billion for the same growth. At $70 billion, Shire would tack on a 4% sales growth rate.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Here, we see Amgen could attain similar revenue growth rates for less than 20% of the upfront capital,"" Young said.Investors also are interested in Amgen's strategy to contend with emerging competition rivaling its biggest drug, Enbrel. In 2017, Amgen's total sales declined 1%. In 2018, Amgen expects total sales to again decline by 2.4% at the midpoint of guidance.Among megamergers, Celgene is most interesting, Young said. Amgen would have to pay $98 billion at a 50-50 split in cash and equity including an addition debt raise of $18 billion. Over 2019-22, Celgene could add 6% and 11% to the top and bottom lines, respectively, on a compound basis.But ""the Celgene financing and Revlimid's controversial intellectual property matters make the deal complex,"" she said. AstraZeneca would also have some interesting revenue synergy, but ""there are significant integration risks"" as AstraZeneca's employee base is three times bigger.In the midcap range, Incyte (INCY) and Alexion are also interesting ""plus they allow for some flexibility to do a few small deals as well,"" Young said. Both would fit nicely with Amgen's hematology unit and require no equity financing.But Incyte is unlikely in the near-term. In the first half of 2018, Incyte and partner Merck (MRK), a Dow Jones component, are set to unveil the results of a trial of their immuno-oncology drugs epacadostat and Keytruda in advanced melanoma.Alexion just had positive data for its next-generation version of its biggest moneymaking drug, Soliris, called ALXN1210. Amgen could buy Alexion for $43 billion, adding 3% and 8% to sales and profit, respectively, Young said.She kept her neutral rating and 194 price target on Amgen. On the stock market today, Amgen lost 3% to close at 182.55, in sympathy with the broader biotech market which fell a collective 1.1%.RELATED:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersInvesting Basics: How To Sell A StockLooking For The Next Nvidia?

39,CELG,"Traders torched stocks today amid a bonfire of selling (with respects to the passing of novelist Tom Wolfe) in the U.S. Treasury bond markets. But a small posse of leadership-quality companies bucked the broad Wall Street decline.They included new IPO Altair Engineering (ALTR), Splunk (SPLK), Cree (CREE), Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and China Lodging (HTHT).In stocks today, homebuilders finished as the worst performer among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down 5%, as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond hit 3.08%, marking a new six-year high.D.R. Horton (DHI) tanked more than 6% to 40.58 and dropped sharply beneath its long-term 200-day moving average. The stock is now 23% beneath a 53.32 peak. LGI Homes (LGIH), which staged a vicious reversal last week despite posting robust Q1 results (EPS up 112% to $1.10, sales up 71% to $279 million), took out its 200-day line as shares fell 5.9% to 58.19.LGI Homes' turnover jumped 149% above its 50-day moving average, a strong hint that fund managers sold anxiously.""Rising mortgage rates are further squeezing affordability for would-be homebuyers that are already frustrated by limited inventory of available homes and higher home prices that have resulted,"" Bankrate.com chief financial analyst Greg McBride said.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average both slid 0.8%; at one point, both averages fell more than 1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%. Volume increased on both main exchanges, according to early data. The higher volume vs. Monday's action implies unusually intense professional selling.As noted in IBD's The Big Picture column, such significant drops in heavier volume are called distribution. A bevy of strong distribution days can signal an end to a major market uptrend.Despite the broad decline among large caps, the Russell 2000 inched less than 1 point higher. The small cap S&P 600 also rose less than 1 point; at 982, the 600 is up 4.9% since Jan. 1 while the S&P 500 is up 1.4%. The IBD current outlook for the market remains ""Confirmed uptrend.""Meanwhile, Leaderboard member Apple (AAPL) staged a gap-down in price, but volume was well below the 50-day average. Given Apple's solid breakout last week, it's normal to see even top stocks pull back to or near the proper buy point.A downward gap appears on a daily chart when the intraday high is below the intraday low of the prior trading session.In Apple's case, Tuesday's intraday high of 187.07 is 79 cents below Monday's session low of 187.86. Not much of a gap.On May 4, Apple broke out of a compact double bottom base pattern that supplied a 179.04 buy point. So far, the breakout has produced a gain of more than 6%.At 186.26, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant is now up 57% past a 118.12 buy point in a first-stage cup with handle, one of the most important chart patterns that top growth stocks produce before breaking out to new highs and big price runs. Apple cleared that base in the midst of its fundamental turnaround, on Jan. 6, 2017.Altair, a member of IBD's specialty enterprise software industry group, barreled more than 6% higher to 33.51 and narrowly eclipsed a 33.49 buy point in a seven-week cup without handle. The 17% decline within the base is bullishly mild. The Troy, Mich.-based expert in innovation-boosting engineering software went public at 13 a share on Nov. 1 last year.Notice on a daily chart how Altair has made a habit of breaking out of IBD-style bases, going up quickly in just a few days, then reversing sharply below the correct entry. But from a longer point of view, the small cap has done a marvelous job of staying on the north side of its 50-day moving average.Altair on Monday posted a 167% leap in Q1 profit to 8 cents a share as revenue rose 19% to $91.7 million, a quarterly best.Meanwhile, Ligand thrust higher for a fifth straight session, rising more than 2% to 185.37. The biotech play is extended 7.7% past a 172.17 entry in a well-formed double-bottom base.The midpoint of 172.07, found in between the two sell-offs within the base, is in the upper half of the base's price range. That's a good sign.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Ligand sports a shiny Composite Rating of 98 on a scale of 1 to 99. This rating, found only in IBD Weekly and at Investors.com, gauges a stock's corporate fundamentals, stock price strength, and quality of institutional sponsorship. It is not a purely technical indicator.Ligand's Relative Price Strength Rating is a stout 91, also on a scale of 1 to 99. This means the San Diego-based company is beating 91% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database in 12-month price performance.In terms of market value, at $3.9 billion Ligand barely lifts a finger to the likes of Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Amgen (AMGN) in the biotech world. However, Ligand is body-slamming these three peers in terms of earnings growth.

40,CELG,"Big-cap biotechs like Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) have fallen under pressure this year for a variety of reasons including revenue concerns, patent issues and weak guidance.But some of their smaller counterparts have rallied, fueled by strong drug sales and/or new drug news, as well as mergers and acquisitions.Take Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), which soared 14% Friday to pad its gains past a 49.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base, which it cleared Thursday. On Wednesday, it leapt 7% after the biotech reported Q1 results that topped views, thanks to strong sales of its Trokendi XR migraine treatment and seizure drug Oxtellar XR. It followed up with a 4% gain Thursday. Supernus is an IBD 50 and Sector Leader stock.Biotech has fallen to No. 35 among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down from No. 9 six weeks ago. But it's now trying to push past resistance at its 50-day moving average, so it may be a good time to keep an eye on biotech exchange traded funds.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe biggest of the bunch is iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), with $8.7 billion in assets. It rose 2% Friday as it continues to consolidate below its 50-day and 200-day moving average lines. Biogen, Celgene (CELG), Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) made up the top five holdings as of May 10. They accounted for just over 35% of the 193-stock portfolio. Supernus is one of its holdings.IBB's 2.9% year-to-date deficit through May 10, according to Morningstar Inc., lags the S&P 500's 2.5% gain. The ETF is one of the oldest biotech funds, with a February 2001 launch. The average market cap of companies in its portfolio is $14.3 billion.Up next is 12-year-old SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI), which tracks the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index. The $4.8 billion fund is also consolidating below its 50-day and 200-day lines. Its YTD gain as of May 10 is 5%. The average market cap of XBI's holdings skews much smaller than IBB at $3.1 billion.

41,CELG,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is trying to ""leapfrog"" Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) with its $1.6 billion acquisition of cancer immunotherapy biotech Armo Biosciences (ARMO), an industry observer said Thursday.Drugmaker Lilly is late to the game in cancer immunotherapy, Brad Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. Loncar runs several biotech stock indexes including the Cancer Immunotherapy Sector Index, which contains Armo. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy exchange-traded fund popped 3.6% Thursday.""The leaders are Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche (RHHBY),"" he said. ""If you're a company that has completely missed the boat and you want to play in this area, you have to do something to try to leapfrog the competition.""Early Thursday, Lilly made its first big move in the cancer immunotherapy space — an area of medicine in which drugs teach the immune system to fight cancer. Lilly said it would pay $50 per share of Armo in an all-cash deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArmo shares rocketed 67% to close at 49.80, as Lilly stock rose 2% to 80.86. Fellow drug stocks, like Merck and Bristol, both rose less than 1%. Roche, which had a failure early in the day in colon cancer, dipped 1.6% to 27.63.Lilly expects the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. Armo, a late-stage biotech, went public at 17 in January and quickly popped. It was a ""hot"" initial public offering, Loncar said, noting that its price early Thursday indicates investors may expect another bid on it.Leerink analyst Jonathan Chang noted that the acquisition price is a 68% premium over Armo's closing price Wednesday. He initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating and 50 price target earlier in the year. On Thursday, he downgraded Armo to market perform.""The deal confirms our investment thesis on Armo and, in our view, could read positively to other emerging immuno-oncology stocks,"" he said. ""It is unclear if other bidders will emerge, given (the) short closing date.""The acquisition makes sense as pharmaceutical stock Lilly tries to assert itself in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. Armo's lead drug, called pegilodecakin, is known as a cytokine. It boosts the strength of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors, like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo.Earlier this year, Bristol validated another cytokine drug called NKTR-214 by paying $1.85 billion upfront to partner with Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) on it. The deal hit a record for an upfront payment in biotech, Loncar said. Now, it's of little surprise that Armo is to be taken out.Loncar has consistently predicted that 2018 would be a big year for biotech deals, mergers and takeouts. The year kicked off with news of Celgene's (CELG) plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi's (SNY) bids on Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).But this deal for Armo is a little different, he said.""I think this one would have happened if we were in the middle of a terrible, bear market,"" he said. On the other hand, ""this is also a good example of large companies like Eli Lilly, many of them have not been at the forefront of innovation and they're having to buy into that.""Still, Lilly isn't alone in its trailing position in cancer immunotherapy. Roche, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) all have immuno-oncology drugs, but remain behind Merck and Bristol which are ""on a level of their own,"" he said.The cancer immunotherapy space desperately needed some good news, he said. Earlier this year, Incyte's (INCY) drug, known as an IDO inhibitor, failed in a late-stage combination with Merck's Keytruda in melanoma. Incyte's pain extended to other cancer immunotherapy stocks.Background volatility remains in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. The key, he said, is that these are all different pieces of technology. The Armo drug is different from the Incyte drug known as epacadostat.""Every news item sets people's moods,"" he said. ""Everybody is down on immunotherapy and thinks it's overrated. Then a deal like this happens and it causes the opposite reaction. Whenever you have an emerging technology like this it's going to be a roller coaster.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

45,CELG,"Celgene's (CELG) multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod, will likely be delayed by a year or more after U.S. regulators punted its application — prompting shares to crash to a four-year low Wednesday.X The Food and Drug Administration is likely focusing on a six-person study initiated in October 2016, a handful of analysts suggested. Celgene submitted its application for ozanimod based on other successful Phase 3 trials.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges suggests Celgene took a gamble, filing the application before having the results of the October 2016 study. The study appears to duplicate the type of work Receptos would have done on ozanimod before Celgene acquired it in 2015.""The completion of the study itself suggests some recognition of a deficiency in the clinical package prepared by the prior owner,"" he said in a note to clients. ""The FDA appeared to surprise the company by demanding that this variance, and the full data, be added to the entire application.""Celgene, though, didn't publicly identify the issue in its application. Late Tuesday, Celgene said the FDA refused to review ozanimod based on ""nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections"" in the application. The company is seeking a meeting with the FDA to determine its next steps.""We remain confident in ozanimod's clinical profile demonstrated in the pivotal program in relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis,"" Celgene Chief Medical Officer Jay Backstrom said in a prepared statement Tuesday.But on the stock market today, Celgene toppled 9% to close at 87.12.Analysts peg the delay on ozanimod between several months and two years. If the issue can be addressed with data from the ongoing pharmacology studies, Celgene could refile by midyear and then wait 60 days for the FDA to decide whether to accept the application, Porges said.Using a standard nine-month review process, ozanimod could now launch in the third quarter of 2019 vs. earlier expectations for the fourth quarter of 2018, he said. Celgene doesn't expect a delay in ozanimod in inflammatory bowel disease, which Porges expects to launch in 2020.""This suggestion is consistent with the lack of direct or alarming clinical effects being behind the delay,"" Porges said.Celgene likely won't have to perform additional clinical trials on ozanimod, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients. The company believes it could either reanalyze existing data or add results from ongoing studies to sufficiently complete the application.""Notably, they appeared confident that the issues in the (refusal-to-file letter) do not affect the ultimate approvability or commercial profile of the drug, and (the) timeline for the inflammatory bowel disease indication would not be affected,"" Abrahams said.Still, Abrahams cut his price target on Celgene to 131 from 140. He expects ozanimod's launch in multiple sclerosis to be delayed by a year. This could have a ""meaningful"" impact on uptake considering this class of multiple sclerosis drugs, known as S1P,  is about to go generic.Ozanimod is considered a safer version of Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya. Both belong to the S1P class of multiple sclerosis drugs. Gilenya is expected to lose exclusivity in 2019, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a report.""With Gilenya losing exclusivity potentially as early as 2019, (ozanimod's) approval could be pushed to late 2019 — well after (the generic version of Gilenya) could be available,"" Raymond said.Canaccord analyst John Newman expects ozanimod in multiple sclerosis treatments to launch in 2020. He cut his U.S. sales estimate for ozanimod to $197 million in 2022 from $340 million previously. Outside the U.S., Newman calls for $129 million, down from $233 million previously.The ozanimod delay is far from Celgene's only pock mark on its inflammation and immunology pipeline. Last year, Celgene halted a late-stage trial in Crohn's disease, which cast doubt on an ulcerative colitis program.After plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla lagged in the third quarter, Celgene cut its 2020 guidance for inflammation and immunology to $2.6 billion to $2.8 billon, from its prior forecast for $4 billion issued in 2015.""Investors in Celgene's stock are likely to start clamoring for more aggressive and extensive changes in the company's leadership and direction after yet another disappointment,"" Leerink's Porges said. He cut his price target to 123 from 135.Analysts note Celgene needs ozanimod to diversify as key cancer drug Revlimid is set to begin losing exclusivity in the mid-2020s. Porges had expected ozanimod to become 15% of total product sales in 2025, based on his earlier estimate.""It's been a rough couple of months,"" Piper Jaffray's Raymond said. This newest obstacle ""only (raises) more questions regarding Celgene's efforts to diversify away from Revlimid.""But Celgene's setback is a silver lining for one biotech: Biogen (BIIB). RBC's Abrahams noted that Biogen now faces one less potential rival on the table in the near term for its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera. Meanwhile, it's weathering the launch of Roche's (RHHBY) rival drug, Ocrevus, fairly well.""We believe any potential prolongation of stability for their core revenue-generating multiple sclerosis franchise is a win and likely to perpetuate views of Biogen as a safe large-cap name to own in 2018,"" he said.RELATED:These Biotechs Diverge After Biggest Moneymakers Lag ExpectationsVeeva Rockets After Topping Quarterly Estimates, Crushing Guidance ViewsTesaro Dives 10% After Biggest Cancer Drug Lags Expectations, Guidance

48,CELG,"Biotech mergers heated Monday after Celgene (CELG) announced it would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) for $9 billion and French pharma Sanofi (SNY) said it would spend $11.6 billion to tack on Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV).X Analysts lauded Celgene's Juno buy, noting it will help fill a hole after Celgene's blood disease drug Revlimid begins losing exclusivity in 2022. But the Street was more split on Sanofi's purchase as the hematology market is expected to soon face disruption from gene therapies.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Juno surged 26.8% to 86. Celgene ticked up 0.3% to 102.91. Bioverativ rocketed 61.9% to 103.79, but Sanofi dived 3.1% to close at 43.20. The broader biotech group popped 3.7%.Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster suggested in a report the group could see a mad scramble in mergers and acquisitions after Sanofi announced its plan to buy Bioverativ. He lists Biomarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) and AveXis (AVXS) as his top takeover picks.""This deal could be a sign that the (merger) spigot has finally turned on as other large pharma companies may feel pressured to move to make full-value bids to grab what is a fairly scarce selection of commercial and commercial-ready assets among the small and midcap biotech spaces,"" he said.Celgene said Monday it would spend $87 per share to acquire Juno — a 93% premium to the stock's closing price —  before rumors sent Juno flying last week. Celgene already owned 9.7% of Juno from a 2015 deal to collaborate on cancer and autoimmune drugs. The merger is expected to close this quarter.Juno is among those working on CAR-T therapies, which engineer a patient's own immune cells to identify and fight cancer cells. Celgene pegs its lead drug, known as JCAR017, as getting approval in the U.S. in 2019 and bringing in a potential peak of $3 billion in sales beyond 2020.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene was particularly hurt in the third quarter when its bigger drugs Revlimid and Otezla missed expectations. And it's not the only one facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s. See who else is at risk by visiting the Industry Snapshot.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond suggested that guidance could be overly bullish.Celgene is ""setting a relatively high bar for an asset that likely won't be alone in its class,"" he said in a note. ""However, if this guidance is achievable, this could be an important source of revenue in the mid- to long-term as Celgene looks to plug a Revlimid hole once its goes generic starting in 2022.""But competition is looking stiff. Gilead Sciences (GILD) spent nearly $12 billion to acquire Kite Pharma last year. About that time, Gilead-Kite gained approval for a CAR-T therapy, following Novartis (NVS), which was first out of the gate with an approval in August.Celgene expects JCAR017 to get approval to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Gilead's drug, Yescarta, is approved to treat that population and Novartis is looking to get its drug, Kymriah, approved for that use as well.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges views the deal positively as it ""consolidates and streamlines"" Celgene's efforts in CAR-T. Celgene also partners with Bluebird Bio (BLUE), working on a multiple myeloma drug known as bb2121, which targets an antigen known as BCMA.""Owning Juno allows Celgene to focus its BCMA efforts initially on Bluebird's bb2121 and to make Juno the vehicle for all development of (drugs that target the CD19 protein), and for the exploration of other targets as opportunities,"" he said in a note to clients.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed noted there can be no cross-pollination in the manufacturing of Juno and Bluebird drugs, but there will be knowledge-based synergies. It's unsure whether Celgene could even look to acquire Bluebird without triggering antitrust concerns, he said.Early Monday, Sanofi said it would buy hemophilia player Bioverativ for $105 per share. The deal is a 64% premium to Bioverativ's closing price Friday, Piper Jaffray's Raymond wrote in another note.""We're not shocked one bit,"" he said. ""With a $1 billion topline and revenue growth of more than 31% last year, yet trading at just five times fiscal year 2018 revenue estimates, we have long viewed Bioverativ as a potential takeout target.""The deal comes after Sanofi twice failed in 2016 and 2017 to make big acquisitions. In 2016, Dow's Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi in a battle for cancer player Medivation. Last year, Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) acquired rare disease biotech Actelion Pharma out from under Sanofi.Sanofi is facing mounting competition for its diabetes drugs. But the trick will be convincing investors that the hemophilia market won't be disrupted by gene therapy and product launches like Roche's (RHHBY) drug Hemlibra, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note.""At a minimum, after a number of speculated successful bids, including Medivation and Actelion, Sanofi investors now have a deal to digest that is immediately accretive to 2018 earnings and estimated to be 'up to 5% accretive in 2019,' "" he said.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay called the bid strong given upcoming competition from Roche, but noted it's likely Sanofi is building on ""lessons learned in the Medivation and Actelion processes where Sanofi led with low offers and was later bested by competitive bidders.""But investors weren't as sure of the merger. Biogen spun out its hemophilia business into Bioverativ a year ago.Bioverativ has two approved drugs, Eloctate in hemophilia A and Alprolix in hemophilia B. Last year, Bioverativ acquired True North Therapeutics.Credit Suisse's Martin called True North ""one of the stronger acquisitions of 2017."" Under it, Bioverativ gained access to a drug now known as BIVV009 to treat a rare autoimmune disease. He models $19 per share for that drug alone.RELATED:Which Biotechs Could Surprise To The Upside On Earnings?This Biotech Stock Rocketed 15% On Rumors Biogen Could Buy ItHow Hospitals Plan To Put Pressure On Generic-Drug Makers

52,CELG,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, an analyst predicted, but biotech guidance will be cautious despite the windfall of tax reform.X The fourth-quarter earnings reporting season kicks off next week with Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS) weighing in Tuesday and Wednesday on the pharma side. Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) are on deck early Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV) trailing on Friday.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges expects cautious predictions at the beginning of 2018, noting the example of Celgene's pre-announcement earlier this month. Uncertainties in payer dynamics, competition and U.S. drug access are likely to play into forecasts.""All these factors, along with an imminent return to a more challenging political environment, suggest that management teams will be more than typically cautious in the guidance that they first provide to the financial community on their earnings calls,"" he said in a note to clients.For the fourth quarter, Porges calls for Vertex's cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco, Gilead's hepatitis C and HIV drugs, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Eylea and Dupixent — the latter two eye disease and eczema treatments, respectively — to surprise to the upside.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs suffered in the third quarter as high profile drugs missed expectations and smaller players took headlines by beating views. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on what happened in the prior quarter and whether history is expected to repeat itself.But he sees older drugs from Amgen (AMGN), including psoriasis and arthritis med Enbrel, as at risk of disappointing investors.

54,CELG,"Dow's Merck (MRK) announced its plan Wednesday to acquire Australian biotech Viralytics in a $394 million deal that dovetails well with the drugmaker's immuno-oncology focus, according to one analyst.X Viralytics is developing a cancer drug called Cavatak. Cavatak is created using a virus that infects and kills cancer cells through a process called oncolysis. It is being tested in several cancers and in combination with Merck's immuno-oncology drug Keytruda.""This is a very nice tuck-in for Merck for less than $400 million and fits very well in the immuno-oncology strategy,"" Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients.On the stock market today, Merck slipped a fraction to 54.55.Raffat called the timing of the deal interesting. Viralytics had guided to offering a clinical update in the second quarter for a combination trial of Cavatak and Keytruda in lung and bladder cancers.In an early-stage study Cavatak and Keytruda were combined in melanoma. Overall, 61% of patients responded to the treatment vs. 33% of patients on Keytruda alone, Raffat said. Cavatak has also been combined with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) drug Yervoy in melanoma.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!Under the terms of the deal, Merck will acquire 100% of the issued shares in Viralytics, which is publicly traded in Australia, for about $1.37 per share. The cash deal represents a 160% premium to the one-month volume weighted average price of Viralytics shares.Merck Senior Vice President Roy Barnes praised the deal in a written statement. The transaction is expected to be implemented in the second quarter when Viralytics will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.""Viralytics' approach of engaging the innate immune system to target and kill cancer cells complements our immuno-oncology strategy, which is focused on the rapid advancement of innovative monotherapy approaches and synergistic combinations to help the broadest range of cancer patients,"" he said.Lepu Medical Group is Viralytics' largest shareholder and currently holds 13% of the firm. The group said it intends to vote for the merger with Merck if a superior proposal doesn't present itself.The deal is just a drop in a much larger bucket of biotech and drugmaker mergers, and analysts say the year could be ""explosive"" in that regard. Already in 2018, there has been north of $25 billion in biotech deals announced vs. about $50 billion in all of 2017.Merck's deal comes on the heels of Roche's (RHHBY) plan announced Friday to acquire Flatiron Health for $1.9 billion. In January, Celgene (CELG) said it would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Sanofi (SNY) announced bids for Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).RELATED:Why 2018 Could Be An Explosive Year For Biotech MergersBiotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

57,CELG,"This year is shaping up to be boisterous for biotech acquisitions after Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi (SNY), in a matter of days, announced plans to spend north of $25 billion to take over three companies, analysts say.X Celgene and Sanofi, in particular, are facing challenges in areas where insurance companies are pushing back on payments in rheumatology and diabetes. That also leaves the likes of Novo Novartis (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in trouble, said Brad Loncar, who manages an immunotherapy-based fund.""These companies have to buy growth,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""They've been growing their revenue doing artificial things whether that's drug price increases, tax inversions or some kind of other type of financial engineering. Those things are going away.""In all of 2017, there was $50 billion spent in biotech deals, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. This year, so far Celgene has said it would spend $9 billion to buy the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it doesn't already own. Sanofi is spending $11.6 billion and $4.8 billion to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).""For companies who haven't bought anything, it's just a matter of opportunity,"" Syed said.The buying spree kicked off in August when Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced its plan to acquire cancer play Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Gilead has been suffering from a major slowdown in hepatitis C drug sales amid high cure rates and saturation in the U.S. and Europe.Celgene and Sanofi announced their plans to acquire Juno and Bioverativ on the same day in January. Days later, Sanofi said it would buy rare disease drugmaker Ablynx.For Celgene, the acquisition followed a disappointing third quarter in which sales of psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis drug Otezla widely missed expectations. The biotech also cut its 2020 guidance on Otezla's shortfall and after terminating several trials in Crohn's disease.Loncar described Celgene's long-term growth prospects at the time as a ""bleak picture."" It's also facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s for its cancer drug Revlimid.IBD'S TAKE: It's challenging holding on to a stock amid a market correction as it declines. But that could help shares form a new potential base. Is it still possible to capture a big gain? Head to the Investor's Corner for four tips on how to make gains during a correction.""So they really couldn't afford to wait,"" he said.Sanofi, on the other hand, was skunked twice in 2016 and 2017 as it tried to acquire Medivation and Actelion Pharma. Dow component Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi for Medivation and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was able to acquire Actelion out from under Sanofi.Roy Behren, a fund manager for Westchester Capital Management, says Sanofi committed a faux pas in both acquisitions — it made a hostile bid for Medivation and went back on an initially higher bid for Actelion, filings show.""Hostile approaches are generally unsuccessful in this space because of the fact the scientists are such an important part of the value equation,"" he told IBD. ""In the case of Sanofi and Medivation, they couldn't arrive at a price unless it was friendly. It was very difficult to complete the acquisition.""Among the high profile acquisitions in late 2017 and early 2018, the acquirers have suffered from pressure on sales of key moneymakers. That, along with tax reform allowing companies to pay less in corporate taxes and repatriate cash at a lower rate, could prime the pump for acquisitions.""I'm a strong believer this is going to be a huge year for acquisitions,"" Loncar said. ""No. 1, for larger companies, their growth is slowing, and No. 2, this tax reform deal adds fuel to that fire. It makes it easier for them to do these deals.""Novo Nordisk lost out on Ablynx to Sanofi. Now, Loncar expects Novo Nordisk to go after other assets to contend with its deep exposure to the diabetes market. Lilly, too, is seeing challenges in diabetes. Meanwhile, Amgen's (AMGN) older drugs are facing new competition.""All big companies really need to do this,"" he said.But there are outliers, Mizuho analyst Syed said. Biogen (BIIB), for instance, guided to flat 2018 sales for its multiple sclerosis unit, including the impact of a royalty it will get on revenue from Roche's (RHHBY) new drug Ocrevus.""There's this perception that the franchises are dwindling,"" he said. ""That's the argument that investors make for a lot of these guys like Biogen, like Amgen — that their base business is going away. That's not necessarily the case. Biogen is stable for 2018.""Still, flat sales won't be enough to pique investor interest. Biogen's aducanumab, a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, is a ""carrot"" for investors until clinical trial data is available toward the end of 2019 or early 2020.""But as long as that carrot is out there, it becomes really difficult for the hedge fund community to short the stock,"" he said. ""Aducanumab can produce returns — if it works — that large-cap biotechs typically don't see.""Westchester's Behren notes biotechs seem to be fairly interested in immunotherapies and oncology. That includes Gilead's acquisition of Kite and Celgene's plan to acquire Juno. Both are working on drugs known as CAR-T therapies, which teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.""There has been a lot of activity in the oncology space in terms of immunotherapies,"" he said. ""The larger companies are trying to gobble up any promising technology they can while it's still affordable. We are also seeing quite a few testing companies being acquired.""Celgene's acquisition of Juno followed a common storyline, Behren said. Celgene invested in Juno in 2015 to create immunotherapies in cancer and autoimmune diseases. The duo is furthest along with JCAR017, a potential treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.When Celgene pulled the trigger on Juno on Jan. 22, it made sense that it was at a 28% premium to Juno's closing price on the prior trading day.""Biotechs — even more than high tech — tend to come at significant premiums to trading prices,"" he said. ""That's because they're somewhat risky, but could be a huge payoff in the event they're successful.""Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) could be amid a similar plot. In September 2016, the duo paired up to test Nektar's drug called NKTR-214 with Bristol's Opdivo in patients with melanoma, kidney cancer and lung cancer. In November, Nektar presented strong early data from the combos.Loncar pegged Nektar as a potential takeover target in 2018, calling NKTR-214 ""revolutionary."" Days later, Bristol announced it would pay Nektar $1.85 billion upfront — comprised of $1 billion in cash and the purchase of 2.28 million shares — to test NKTR-214 with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy.The deal allows Bristol to remain the leader in immuno-oncology/immuno-oncology combinations without risking a $16 billion bid on Nektar, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a Feb. 14 note to clients.""I have no doubt (Nektar's) phone has been ringing off the hook since (November) because their data was so interesting,"" Loncar said. ""If someone is bold enough to buy them, it could put the acquirer into a class of their own in immuno-oncology.""Drugs called PARP inhibitors also look interesting, Loncar said. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) both have drugs approved in this class and are small enough to acquire. AstraZeneca (AZN) also works in that space.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) have also had successful launches recently.""If a company wants revenue growth, buy a rare-disease drug,"" he said. ""They have the best sales ramps. I think those types of companies are really interesting right now. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them get bought out.""RELATED:Biotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

The congressional hearings were prompted by revelations that data consultancy Cambridge Analytica had wrongfully obtained personal information on millions of Facebook users without their knowledge. Facebook beefed up its privacy controls and said it would halt selling some data to third-party brokers. Facebook shares initially tumbled but rose modestly for the week.Amazon fell 4.4% Wednesday, undercutting its 50-day line, on a report that President Trump wants to ""go after"" the e-commerce giant. Trump has long been critical of Amazon, perhaps in part because CEO Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post. The White House denied any plans to target Amazon. But Trump tweeted his ""concerns"" regarding Amazon on Thursday. Amazon initially fell Thursday but closed up 1.1%. Fellow FANG Netflix (NFLX) found support at its 50-day line.Shares of Lululemon (LULU) soared 12% to record highs for the week. The athletic apparel maker and retailer beat estimates across the board and raised full-year guidance. EPS rose 33% to $1.33 as revenue grew nearly 18% to $929 million. In North America, where peers like Nike (NKE) have struggled, Lululemon sales grew in the low single digits. And online sales popped 42% in constant currency on top of 12% prior-year growth. Analysts said new products, an improved website and marketing investments fueled the quarterly win. Apparel makers and retailers are a pocket of market strength.The Linux open-source software provider's earnings growth accelerated to 49% in its fiscal fourth quarter.

That's after selling 125 million shares at 18 apiece, in line with the expected range. The $2.25 billion raised in the IPO was just shy of January's $2.27 billion IPO from PagSeguro Digital (PAGS). Called ""the Netflix (NFLX) of China,"" iQiyi has a licensing deal with Netflix. With 50 million subscribers, iQiyi has about 28% market share in China, where rivals Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) have their own streaming services in a hotly contested battle for viewers.The Fed's favorite inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, showed a slight uptick in February. The annual inflation rate edged up to 1.6% from 1.5%, an 11-month high. Inflation is far below the Fed's 2% target, and there's enough doubt about corporate pricing power. So inflation will have to rise further to pressure Fed policymakers to hike rates more than three times this year. Commerce Department data on Thursday showed that disposable personal income rose 0.4% in February, but spending rose a modest 0.2%. That suggests people may initially be saving their tax cuts. Consumers ended 2017 on a strong note.

60,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) could comfortably spend $11 billion to acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), an analyst said Wednesday as Juno shares soared on rumors the two biotechs could be in merger talks.X Analysts applauded the potential deal which would make strategic sense for both firms. Juno needs Celgene's size to compete against bigger rivals in treating blood cancers, and Celgene is facing a patent cliff for its blood cancer drug Revlimid, they say.""While we are rarely fans of high premium takeovers, this deal probably makes sense for Celgene, and won't surprise the company's shareholders,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.In midday trading on the stock market today, Juno shares raced to a record high of 70 before ending the day at 69.25, up nearly 52%. Celgene, though, sank 2.7% to finish at 102.02.Juno and Celgene already partner on a CAR-T program. CAR-T therapies use patients' immune cells to fight against cancer. Under this 2015 deal, Celgene owns 10% of Juno stock, pays some development costs and owns some commercialization rights.But the duo is facing stiff competition in the CAR-T arena, following Gilead Sciences' (GILD) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma in October. Now, Gilead and Novartis (NVS) both have CAR-T drugs approved, meaning Juno is trailing with a potential approval this year.IBD'S TAKE: Juno has an IBD Composite Rating of 51 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms 51% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated biotech stocks.Leerink's Porges compared Juno and Kite. Both are CAR-T players working to develop therapies that target the CD19 protein in some tumors. Each claims to have proprietary elements to their constructs and manufacturing processes that will give them an edge.""They will commercialize similar products for similar indications within 18 months of each other and with approximately similar clinical results,"" he said. ""This suggests to us that they are much more similar than any other two biopharma companies could be.""But Juno faced a setback in March 2017 after five patients died while receiving a CAR-T therapy. Juno has since scrapped that particular therapy and is working on another, but Kite — with Gilead — got to the market first.Porges suggests Celgene and Juno could settle on a price similar to Gilead's $11.9 billion acquisition of Kite. Juno sees its technology as best-in-class and will argue for a premium. Celgene will argue for a discount, noting Gilead has a first-to-market advantage.As of Tuesday's close and before acquisition rumors cropped up, Juno had a market cap just north of $5 billion. With Wednesday's stock movement, Juno's market cap rose close to $7.7 billion.""In the end, Juno will recognize that they are now competing with Novartis and Gilead, and probably need the resources of at least a Celgene to be successful in the market,"" he said. Neither seems inclined to let the deal fail over ""price hubris,"" he added.Juno — like Gilead and Novartis — isn't going to stop at its first CAR-T approval. CAR-T therapies have shown promise in blood cancers, though a number of biopharmas also are looking at their potential use in solid tumors.Juno looks likely to gain approval later this year for its therapy, JCAR017, to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Gilead already has a therapy approved there. Novartis is also seeking an approval for this use.After, Juno will look at other possible uses, including other leukemias and lymphomas, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a note to clients. In total, he estimates $1.7 billion in U.S. peak sales in 2025, assuming a best-case scenario.Schmidt expects Juno to capture a third of the market in CAR-T drugs that target the CD19 protein in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.In the latter indication, Novartis already has an approval. Schmidt also sees Juno getting 17% of the market in multiple myeloma where fellow Celgene partner Bluebird Bio (BLUE) is working.RELATED:How Blood-Disease Data Sent These 2 Biotech Stocks FlyingDoes Gilead Now Have A New Multi-Billion-Dollar Franchise?How Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

61,CELG,"Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) surged 46% in late trading Tuesday on a report that Celgene (CELG) is in talks to acquire it.X According to the Wall Street Journal, unnamed sources say Celgene is in talks to buy Juno. The two have long-partnered on cancer treatments including CAR-T drugs that teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.The talks could pan out in a deal in the coming weeks, sources say. The potential deal to acquire Juno would come on the heels of Gilead Sciences' (GILD) nearly $12 billion purchase of CAR-T drugmaker Kite Pharma late last year.Now, Gilead and Novartis (NVS) have the only approved CAR-T drugs on market. Juno could follow with a CAR-T drug approval later this year, the company has said. So far, CAR-T drugs look best poised to treat blood cancers. Firms are also looking into using these therapies in solid tumors.For Gilead, buying Kite helps stem the gap from declining hepatitis C drug sales. For Celgene, buying its longtime partner Juno could give it a leg up as it prepares to lose patient protection for Revlimid, which treats a blood cancer known as multiple myeloma.IBD'S TAKE: Some hematology focused biotechs have piqued investor interest of late. See what these firms are working on by visiting IBD Industry Themes.A representative of Juno declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily. Representatives of Celgene didn't immediately return requests for comment.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Juno rocketed 46% to 66.35 after closing down 6.5% at 45.60.

62,CELG,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) offered preliminary fourth-quarter results Monday that looked as if they would come in ahead of analyst estimates for profits, an announcement the company made shortly after it agreed to buy privately held Impact Biomedicines.X Celgene said it expects adjusted earnings of anywhere between $2.00 per share, up 24% from the year-ago figures. Revenue is expected to climbed 17% to $3.483 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of $1.93 on sales of $3.46 billion.Celgene shares dropped 0.8% to close at 104.18 on Monday.The company said late Sunday it was purchasing Impact Biomedicines with an upfront payment of $1.1 billion. Celgene will make additional milestone payments if Impact's fedratinib wins FDA approval and has strong sales, bringing the total potential price tag to roughly $7 billion.Fedratinib is a potential treatment for myelofibrosis, a type of bone marrow cancer.""Myelofibrosis is a disease with high unmet medical need as the number of patients who are ineligible for or become resistant to existing therapy continues to increase,"" said Nadim Ahmed, President, Hematology and Oncology for Celgene, in a statement announcing the Celgene-Impact deal. ""We believe fedratinib is uniquely positioned as a potential treatment for myelofibrosis and it provides strategic options for us to build leadership in this disease with luspatercept and other pipeline assets.""Impact Bio's founders had sold fedratinib to France's Sanofi (SNY), which gave up development of the treatment in 2013 due to serious side effects. But Impact later bought the rights back.If successful, fedratinib would compete with a similar drug from Incyte (INCY), known as Jakafi.Celgene has had disappointing sales and trials of new drugs recently, while its blockbuster cancer fighter Revlimid faces challenges. Celgene cut its full-year outlook in late October, sending shares plunging.

66,CELG,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) plunged late Tuesday after reporting fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that topped Wall Street expectations, but that declined for the seventh consecutive period amid challenged hepatitis C drug sales.X In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Gilead sank as much as 3%, though it was down 1.6% in more recent action. During the regular session, Gilead popped 2.6%, to 80.38. Biotech stocks rallied to pare earlier losses and close up 1.9%.For the fourth quarter, Gilead reported adjusted profit of $1.78 per share on $5.95 billion in sales, declining 34.1% and 18.7%, respectively. Both metrics topped the consensus for adjusted income of $1.70 a share on $5.78 billion in sales.Total product sales fell 19.1% to $5.84 billion. Gilead felt the most pain outside the U.S. and Europe where product revenues declined 36.4%. In Europe, sales of products declined 21.4%, leading a 16.3% dip in U.S. product sales.Sales of HIV and hepatitis B drugs increased 8.8% year over year to $3.7 billion.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market is now a nine-year affair, though pundits have been calling for its downfall since the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Is it time to review your stock-selling rules? Head to the Investor's Corner.But hepatitis C drug sales toppled 53.1% with declines across all major markets, Gilead said. Blockbusters Harvoni and Sovaldi have both been in decline since the third quarter of 2016 amid high cure rates and market maturation.Epclusa was approved in June 2016 and had grown year-over-year for two quarters, but fell for the first time in the fourth period of 2017.Harvoni, the biggest of the three, saw its sales decline 60.7% to $644 million. Epclusa, now the second most important of the trio, fell 46.1% to $565 million. Sovaldi brought in $117 million in revenue, down 78.4%.For 2018, Gilead guided to $20 billion to $21 billion in product sales. The consensus had forecast $21.58 billion in revenue. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams noted competitive dynamics are expected to shrink the hepatitis C market to $3.5 billion to $4 billion.The product sales guidance was lower than expected while the operational expenses outlook came in higher, Abrahams said in a note to clients. Still, he remained bullish on Gilead's other programs.""Overall with the Street beginning to look beyond hepatitis C and expectations coming down, we believe the stage remains set for a near-term earnings nadir and visibility towards growth driven by HIV, CAR-T and pipeline,"" he said.In October, Gilead closed its $11.9 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma. Investors had long pushed for Gilead to make an acquisition amid dwindling hepatitis C drug sales. Days later, Gilead/Kite got approval for a CAR-T drug called Yescarta to treat a blood cancer. CAR-T drugs are a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells are changed in the laboratory to attack cancer.During the fourth quarter, Yescarta brought in $7 million in sales, beating the consensus by $1 million, Abrahams said.The CAR-T landscape now includes two other major players including Celgene (CELG) after its plan to acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Novartis (NVS), the latter of which was the first to gain approval of a CAR-T drug, Kymriah.RELATED:These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystAllergan Pops On Consensus-Topping Quarter, Strong Migraine TrialThese Biotech Stocks Each Dives More Than 20% — Is The Sell-Off Overdone?

67,CELG,"Biotech investors collectively pulled $1.2 billion out of the sector this week — but analysts said Friday that's the byproduct of a broader market correction, not malaise in health care-tied stocks.X For the week ended Feb. 7, health care and biotech funds saw $1.21 billion in net outflows, representing a 1.95% decrease in assets, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond wrote in a note to clients. At the same time, all equities posted a 0.33% dip in assets.The reason: Biotech stocks tend to experience the worst of a market correction, said Brad Loncar, a portfolio manager who runs a cancer immunotherapy-based fund. Biotech stocks hit a multiyear high in late January but have since lost nearly 13%.""I believe this is totally normal and I think that biotech is just doing so terrible this week because it's a volatile sector and when the entire stock market has a bad week like this, biotechs are likely to do a little bit worse,"" he told Investor's Business Daily.Most pundits say the market correction is overdue. In general, the market experienced a very mild 2017 with gradual rising and few interruptions. Now, it's heading into a ""risk-off"" scenario as investors seek lower-risk positions, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat told IBD in an email.By the close on the stock market today, the biotech group eked out a small gain, paring earlier losses when it fell as much as 4.6%. For the week, the group was down nearly 5.5%.Among those hardest hit this week was Corcept Therapeutics (CORT), which lopped off 38% on a coming rivalry from Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) for a treatment for Cushing's syndrome, which affects the pituitary gland. Prothena (PRTA) dove 28% after its chief medical officer announced her departure.Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) all lost north of 8%. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) topped fourth-quarter views, but plunged nearly 5%. Gilead Sciences (GILD) toppled more than 4% as guidance missed.But among large-caps, fourth-quarter metrics and 2018 guidance was largely in line with expectations, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young told IBD. She described the fourth quarter as a ""decent showing"" with ""no fires,"" unlike the strained third quarter.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average toppled 4.1% lower on Thursday while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 tumbled 3.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Are bears taking a bite out of the bull market? Head to The Big Picture for more.""Hopefully that trend continues,"" she said. ""But this is biotech, it's a risky space and things happen.""Young and Loncar agree that the market correction isn't indicative of the outlook for the biotech group. Both say the fundamentals look strong and the group is poised for buying spree, which began late last year with Gilead's acquisition of Kite Pharma.In January, Celgene said it would buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Sanofi (SNY) announced acquisitions of Biogen spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) and Belgium's Ablynx (ABLX). Sanofi beat out Novo Nordisk (NVO) for Ablynx.Smart companies will go after assets when valuations go down, Loncar said. Many of the bigger players are facing payer scrutiny in saturated areas like rheumatology and diabetes. For Gilead, declining hepatitis C drug sales led to its Kite purchase. Celgene is facing competition in inflammation drugs.""No. 1, the larger companies have slowing growth so they need to buy growth and they need to buy innovation,"" he said. ""And No. 2, this tax reform deal that just passed kind of adds fuel to the fire and makes it much more easy for them to do these deals.""RELATED:Gilead Pops After FDA Approves Glaxo-Rivaling HIV DrugThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystAlexion Tops Quarterly Views But Guidance Lags; Alnylam Dips On Losses

The stepped-up pace reflects expectations of a stronger economy propelled by tax cuts and federal spending hikes. Now policymakers expect core inflation to rise to 2.1% next year, just above the Fed's target.Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) reported fourth-quarter earnings ahead of expectations but sales growth came up short for the Chinese messaging and gaming giant, sending the stock down 3% on Wednesday.

MuleSoft's sales jumped 58% last year to $296 million.  The deal is expected to be earnings dilutive through 2019. MuleSoft software automates the integration of new tools with legacy enterprise platforms and speeds application development.  Salesforce.com shares fell on the announcement.AbbVie (ABBV) cratered nearly 13% Thursday after it scuttled plans to seek accelerated approval for a lung cancer drug that performed poorly in a midstage trial.

69,CELG,"Celgene (CELG), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Incyte (INCY) are worth watching amid a broader market correction that saw biotech stocks lose a collective 8% over the previous five days, an analyst said Tuesday.X Biotech stocks rebounded 1.9% on the stock market today, after diving 3.5% on Monday.BMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Belski said in a note to clients that investors are reaping what they sowed.""For all intents and purposes, the majority of clients, market pundits and especially an increasingly boisterous set of naysayers, have been predicting the bull market's imminent demise since the day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" he said.But that doesn't mean the bull market is dead, Belski said. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams agreed — and sees some ""opportune entry points"" for certain biotechs stocks with data and/or approvals expected in 2018.Things are looking up for Celgene after a few missteps in the second half of 2017 — including a major miss in sales of psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla in the third quarter, Abrahams said. Sales of that drug rebounded in the fourth quarter.""We believe the market cap reduction more than reflected that, and we believe their fourth-quarter numbers and 2018 guidance point to reassuring stabilization of key U.S. Revlimid and Otezla sales,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: A bull market is a good time review your stock-selling smarts because once it begins to stall out of an uptrend, it's too late to catch up. Head to the Investor's Corner to brush up on stock-selling rules.Cancer drug Revlimid is Celgene's biggest drug. Analysts have worried about generic rivals taking sales starting in 2022. To contend with that, Celgene recently announced its plan to acquire the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own.Adding Juno to its coffers puts Celgene in the CAR-T space where it will compete against Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the latter via its acquisition of Kite Pharma. CAR-T therapies teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.But even without Juno, Celgene looks poised to generate enough cash flow to buy back virtually its entire enterprise value before Revlimid goes completely generic in 2026, Abrahams said.Outside that, Abrahams sees a number of 2018 catalysts including additional data for Revlimid in treating lymphoma and late-stage data for drug luspatercept, with partner Acceleron Pharma (XLRN), in blood disorders.Celgene rose 2.7% to 96.25 on Tuesday.Abrahams says Vertex was ""a victim of bad timing."" Vertex recently reported strong data for its triple-combination regimens in cystic fibrosis. But the data came out just as the broader markets were beginning to turn and the stock fell hard the past two days. But Vertex rebounded Tuesday, rising 2.7% to 159.27.Strong effectiveness from drugs known as VX-659 and VX-445 in two triple regimens heading into Phase 3 studies support the likelihood that Vertex can expand into a tough-to-treat population of cystic fibrosis patients, he said.It also enables ""multiple additional shots on goal and sets a bar that will be difficult to match or beat — and with significant lead time — likely rendering mid-year competitive data from Galapagos (GLPG) (an overhang on Vertex shares) much less impactful.""He raised his price target on Vertex to 200. The macro weakness is masking improved fundamentals, Abrahams argued.Incyte is set to read out data from a Phase 3 trial known as Echo-301 in the first half of 2018. The study combined Incyte's immuno-oncology drug epacadostat with Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in late-stage melanoma.Both drugs belong to a class known as immuno-oncology treatments. Epacadostat works to block interactions involving the IDO enzyme in the immune system. Keytruda is called a PD-1 inhibitor, which has a similar interaction with the PD-L1 protein.Instinet analyst Christopher Marai expects the trial will read out positively and could be similar to a regimen of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Bristol is also combining these drugs to treat other cancers, including advanced lung cancer.If so, ""epacadostat could become part of the standard of care in metastatic melanoma with broad adoption augmenting current anti-PD-1 use,"" he said in a note to clients. That could lead to peak worldwide sales north of $1 billion in melanoma alone for epacadostat.But RBC's Abrahams says eventually nearly all the value for epacadostat will soon be gone from Incyte's shares. He sees $65 per share for Jakafi, which treats a bone marrow disorder, and $8 per share for Olumiant, a rheumatoid arthritis drug co-developed with Eli Lilly (LLY).This ""suggests downside if upcoming epacadostat data are negative is now likely only about $10 per share, with fundamental upside now potentially more than 50%,"" he said. This ""makes the upside/downside at these levels that much more interesting.""Incyte advanced 3.3% to 88.11 on Tuesday.RELATED:Allergan Pops On Consensus-Topping Quarter, Strong Migraine TrialThese Biotech Stocks Each Dived More Than 20% — Is The Sell-Off Overdone?Can CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?

70,CELG,"AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are the likeliest targets of a biopharma ""detonation event"" in which tax reform spurs widespread mergers and acquisitions across the group, an analyst said Friday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez calls the coming consolidation ""inevitable.""Products made by the likes of AbbVie (ABBV), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Shire (SHPG) are soon to face new competition and generic rivals.This follows ""an unprecedented period of innovation and new product launches within large biopharma,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Several of the largest companies will likely experience a substantial growth slowdown within the next five to seven years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCelgene, Biogen and AstraZeneca would be most accretive to a potential acquirer, based on short-term financials, Fernandez said. Their average accretion in 2020 would be 25%, 14% and 13%, respectively.But Bristol, AstraZeneca and Vertex make the most sense long-term and strategically, he said. These three appear to be ""best positioned"" for longer-term revenue growth based on a look at consensus expectations for 2020-24.The last major consolidation period in biopharma occurred during the last decade, in which there were seven deals greater than $40 billion in value. The largest was Dow Jones stock Pfizer's (PFE) $93.8 billion acquisition of Warner-Lambert, at a 34% premium.Pfizer also paid the biggest premium, 38%, on Pharmacia, forking over $60.5 billion to acquire the firm. Merck paid a 34% premium to buy Schering-Plough for $45.7 billion. Since 2010, deals combining Pfizer with AstraZeneca and Allergan (AGN) and AbbVie with Shire have failed.Fernandez sees the next cycle as a seller's market. Pfizer is struggling with its late entry to the immuno-oncology market, whereas Merck has a strong immuno-oncology drug — Keytruda — but lacks a robust late-stage pipeline.Roche faces biosimilar competition for its top drugs: Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. Novartis (NVS) is still experiencing challenges in its Sandoz unit. AbbVie is strong in the near-term, but its key drug Humira will soon see competition in Europe and in the U.S. after 2022.Strategically, AstraZeneca would be a strong fit for AbbVie, Pfizer, Roche or Merck, Fernandez said. Bristol could fit in at AbbVie and Pfizer. Meanwhile, it's possible AbbVie could swing for Vertex.Through a financial lens, AstraZeneca, Vertex, Biogen and Bristol are the most compelling targets for their ability to enhance long-term sales, he said.Amgen could be an acquirer or a target with $70 billion in funds to buy something, Fernandez said. Assuming Amgen is looking to make a deal valued at less than $90 billion, Vertex rises to the top of the list among the potential targets, outlasting Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Shire.""Among the three, Vertex looks more interesting,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts for adjusted profit of $1.44 a share on $7.59 billion in sales.By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie soared by 13.8% to close at 123.21, helping drug stocks to rise a collective 1.9%.Guidance for a lower 2018 tax rate should have been expected, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. In December, the White House approved legislation that lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.""With this tax rate, and the company's revenue growth and margin performance, we expect a significant increase in free cash flow in 2018, with attendant de-leveraging, thus setting the stage for more active business development activity from yet another industry behemoth,"" he said. Investors had previously expected AbbVie to guide to a 20% tax rate, Porges said.Mergers activity has been heating recently in the biopharma group. This week, Celgene (CELG) said it would buy the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own for $9 billion. In 2017, Gilead Sciences (GILD) spent nearly $12 billion to acquire Kite Pharma.AbbVie expects its effective tax rate to increase to 13% over the next five years due to increased domestic income and investment, Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in his note to clients.As for AbbVie's results, sales of Humira — which treats several forms of arthritis, Crohn's disease and plaque psoriasis — increased 14% to $4.89 billion in sales. Humira is AbbVie's most important drug. Sales beat the consensus for $4.82 billion, Raymond said.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie leads its group with an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, making it a leader among all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. For more on how drug stocks rank, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Cancer drug Imbruvica brought in $708 million in revenue, growing nearly 39%. That was $1 million ahead of analysts' collective view, Raymond said.Worldwide sales of AbbVie's hepatitis C drugs Viekira and Mavyret advanced more than 63% vs. the year-earlier period to $510 million, beating the consensus by 89%, said Porges.The lower tax rate also boosted other 2018 guidance. For the year, AbbVie calls for adjusted income of $7.33-$7.43 per share, up from $6.45-$6.55 and topping the consensus for $6.57. Sales are expected to approach $32 billion, above the Street consensus view for $31.4 billion.RELATED:Intuitive Surgical Tops Fourth-Quarter Sales, Earnings ViewsCelgene Reverses In Fourth Quarter As Otezla Sales ReboundBiogen Revenue Tops As Spinraza, MS Drugs Deliver Upside

72,CELG,"Puma Biotechnology's (PBYI) licensing agreement for breast cancer drug Nerlynx won't inhibit takeover interest for Puma, an analyst said Tuesday as shares tumbled following the deal.X Early Tuesday, Puma said it will allow Medison Pharma to commercialize Nerlynx in Israel where it is not yet approved. Nerlynx is used in the U.S. to treat breast cancer in patients with a specific genetic condition that makes them more susceptible to cancer.Investors, though, are seemingly keyed in on whether Puma will be acquired, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said. Takeover interest in biopharma has spiked recently. Celgene (CELG) is planning to buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Sanofi (SNY) is buying Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).""Importantly, we do not see this partnership removing mergers and acquisition interest for Puma, which we view as critical to the bull thesis on the stock,"" he said in a note to clients.Under terms of the deal, Puma will receive upfront and milestone payments as well as double-digit royalties on Nerlynx sales in Israel.""Our new agreement with Medison demonstrates our commitment to bringing Nerlynx to patients around the world while continuing to focus our commercial resources on the U.S. market,"" Chief Executive Alan Auerbach said in a written statement.But MacKay called the deal ""largely incremental."" In Israel, there are about 4,500 breast cancer cases diagnosed annually vs. about 250,000 in the U.S. Of those, only about 20% of patients have the specific gene amplification required for Nerlynx use.MacKay sees a potential for peak sales of $860 million for Nerlynx. He expects Nerlynx to bring in $20 million in fourth-quarter sales, below the consensus view for $21 million.IBD'S TAKE: Drugs to treat rare diseases can often cost quite a bit. But insurers aren't scrambling to push back on covering those drugs. See why by going to the Industry Snapshot.Puma has struggled with Nerlynx recently. Earlier this month, European authorities said it was unlikely they would approve Nerlynx for use in some breast cancer patients when it comes to a vote next month. Shares toppled by a third that day.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Puma slid 4.6% to close at 65.75, after falling as much as 9.7% in earlier trades.Biotech stocks collectively dipped 1.3%, though some were down more after Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) announced a collaboration to cut down on costs of health care in the U.S.RELATED:Why Valeant's 162% Climb Over Nine Months 'Makes No Sense'Dow's J&J Topples After Judge Tosses Patent On Blockbuster DrugWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

73,CELG,"The median tenure of chief executives at large-cap biotech companies was just one year in 2017, plunging from 11 years in 2007, amid key transition periods at Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), an analyst said Wednesday.X New chief executives also tend to hold onto less power, with under 30% of biotech chiefs having dual titles of CEO and board chairman compared with 100% of pharma chiefs in 2017, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.""We believe investors, understandably, find it hard to have confidence in these new executives given their lack of track record, and the recent history of the group is unlikely to inspire confidence,"" he said.Investors are also likely to view these executives as having less power to broker mergers and acquisitions, contributing to expectations for relatively modest deal activity in 2018 despite the improved cash positions of most large-caps, Porges said.Through the 2000s, biotech companies were operated by chief executives with long tenures, mostly scientific backgrounds, proven track records, and familiarity to investors, Porges said. A number of CEOs were founder-scientists or carefully chosen successors.IBD'S TAKE: Large-cap biotechs were frustrated in 2017 as smaller plays and newer medicines started taking share. Analysts say the trend will continue in 2018. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on what it means for the biggest stocks.The collapse of median large-cap biotech CEO tenures over the past 10 years followed an uptick from six years in 2002 to 11 years in 2007. Meanwhile, pharma companies saw a rotation of CEOs with business and law degrees and a median duration of experience under three years in both 2002 and 2007.""However, this imbalance reversed itself in the early 2010s, and by 2012 the median biotech CEO tenure had declined to match pharma at two years,"" Porges said.In 2017, the median CEO tenure at large-cap U.S. pharmaceuticals was five years. CEOs at pharmas have maintained their dual roles at chief executives and chairman 80%-100% of the time. But biotech CEOs had that dual role just 40%-60% of the time from 2002-12.This is ""likely as a result of the high prevalence of physician/scientist-founders that often had a senior business leader in the chairman position,"" Porges said.He sees pros and cons for a company that combines its chief executive and chairman positions under one hat.""But we believe the lack of strong authority in these leadership positions in biotech companies is certainly suggestive of a lack of immediate opportunity for transformative changes in companies or industry structure,"" he said. ""Investors who are dissatisfied with the company performance are also likely to find these divided title arrangements more vulnerable to challenges and change than entrenched CEO-chairmen.""RELATED:Which Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?Stocks Rise But Apple, Bitcoin Fall; This Play Pays Big DividendsHow Tax Reform Impacts Your Tax Bracket And Rate

74,CELG,"In a year when semiconductor, energy, internet, homebuilding and other industries had their moments, it was biotechs that had the most winners.X Nearly a third of the 100 best-performing stocks of 2017 were biotechs, far more than any other industry group. The group also accounted for 14 of the top 20 stocks of the year. As a whole, the industry finished the year in the top 40 of 197 that IBD tracks, up nearly 32%. (A link to a list of all of 2017's top 100 stocks is at the end of this article.)Biotechnology companies are a curious bunch. Many are unprofitable, but their shares can soar on hopes that the drugs they're developing will become blockbusters. In fact, the 10 best-performing biotechs of 2017 are all posting losses for the year, and have been for at least a few years.See List Of Best Stocks Of 2017Investing in companies with no profits is risky, which is why IBD's CAN SLIM method seeks companies that not only are profitable but are among the ones with highest earnings growth. Historically, that's been the characteristic that best exemplifies Wall Street's winners.Special Report: 2018 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2017 Stock Market ReviewIt is a vast industry group, with about 460 companies. But the average EPS Rating is a lousy 27 out of a highest-possible 99. Even companies with profitable histories are susceptible to sell-offs. Celgene (CELG) crashed 30% in a five-day period in October, first on news that it halted trials of a Crohn's disease drug, then on disappointing sales and a dimmed outlook.Few industries have the risk-reward equation of biotechs. Getting a drug to market is fraught with risks, including the chance that clinical trials will fail, or that regulators won't approve it. On the other hand, a successful drug can result in billions in sales. Biogen's (BIIB) multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera had $1.07 billion in sales in the third quarter alone.That's why successful trial results often send shares rocketing, even if actual sales are years away.AnaptysBio (ANAB), one of this year's top new issues and top overall stocks, doubled on Oct. 10 following the announcement of successful tests of its eczema drug. AnaptysBio went public at 15 a share and is now near 100. Analysts expect the company to lose $1.71 a share for 2017 and to lose $2.46 a share in 2018.Exact Sciences (EXAS), one of the top 10 stocks of the year, makes Cologuard, an at-home test for colon cancer. On Oct. 30, the company reported Q3 sales increased 158% to $72.6 million, and raised its 2017 sales guidance to $254 million-$257 million.Other stocks in the top 100 give some glimpses of 2017's big stories in the markets.Overstock.com (OSTK) made it to the top 12, but not necessarily because of its online shopping success. No, Overstock enriched shareholders thanks to its connections to blockchains, the electronic networks used for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne is part of a joint venture building a blockchain-based global registry for property rights in the developing world. A sale of Overstock.com to fund the project is a possibility. Also, Overstock.com accepts Bitcoin.Roku (ROKU) shares soared 270% in 2017, a reflection of the cut-the-cord movement in home entertainment. Consumers shedding their cable and satellite-TV services have opted for internet-delivered video services that are cheaper and sometimes better tailored to viewers' tastes.Roku, which went public Sept. 28 at 14 a share, is now trading near 52. The company makes hardware and software for internet video services like Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and Amazon.com's (AMZN) Prime Video.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.Chinese stocks were hot for much of the year, especially internet companies. Social media firms like YY Inc. (YY) and Weibo (WB), online retailer Baozun (BZUN) and Craigslist.com clone 58.com (WUBA) produced gains of 150% to nearly 200% for the year. Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), China's leading online messaging and gaming provider, more than doubled in an outstanding advance.Strong profits or profit recoveries were factors in this bloc's success. Chinese stocks earned a reputation for wild volatility, but that problem was largely absent in 2017's top China-based equities.Rising interest rates and the possibility that banking regulations may ease gave financials some fuel. But few made the top 100. A couple of Argentine banks, loan marketplace LendingTree (TREE) and mobile payment company Square (SQ) were some of the samplings from this sector.To find the best stocks of 2017, IBD screened for those that began the year trading above 10 a share.

75,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) toppled late Thursday after its drug regimen failed in a Phase 3 study of patients with a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.X In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Celgene dove 4.5%, near 103, after closing down 0.4%, at 107.88.The trial investigated a regimen of Revlimid plus rituximab followed by maintenance treatment with rituximab compared with the standard of care of rituximab plus chemotherapy. The regimen was tested in patients with follicular lymphoma.Revlimid is Celgene's blockbuster blood cancer drug. Rituximab is sold under the brand name, Rituxan, by Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech and Biogen (BIIB).The treatment didn't achieve superiority in complete response and unconfirmed complete response at 120 weeks and progression-free survival at a preplanned analysis, both key goals of the trial.RELATED:Biogen Shares Drop After Alzheimer's Drug Misses In TestingThis Biotech Stock Launched after Joining The S&P 600 SmallCapWhy These Biotech Stocks Could Be Taken Over In 2018

77,CELG,"The major stock indexes held modest losses in late-afternoon trading Friday ahead of the long holiday weekend, but the session wasn't entirely without incident as Bitcoin speculators suffered more pain.X After three straight declines that saw Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) lose nearly 50% of its value, it plunged another 35% Friday but recovered after touching the 50-day moving average. Bitcoin itself slumped below $11,500 at one point Friday after starting the week close to $20,000. One of Bitcoin's major exchanges, Coinbase, suspended transactions temporarily.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were mostly flat or down 0.1%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking well below Thursday's levels in the stock market today.Money continued to flow into oil and gas names Friday even though U.S. crude oil futures were mostly unchanged around $58.40 a barrel. Concho Resources (CXO) followed through after Thursday's breakout over a 147.87 buy point. Shares rose 1% to 151.50.Group peer and IBD 50 name Diamondback Energy (FANG) is also showing good follow through after a breakout this week. Shares were up another 1% to 124.50. Diamondback is on pace for a weekly gain of more than 13% and was added to Leaderboard earlier this week.IBD'S TAKE: You can trade the IBD 50 with one click via the Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY), managed by Innovator Capital Management.On the downside, Celgene (CELG) gapped down after the former biotech leader disclosed that a treatment for  a form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma failed in a Phase 3 trial. Celgene gapped down on Oct. 20 after stopping a Phase 3 trial for a drug to treat Crohn's disease.Elsewhere, Shake Shack (SHAK) held up relatively well despite a downgrade from Jefferies to underperform from hold.

79,CELG,"Biotech and internet-related large caps helped the Nasdaq composite forge a solid gain of 1% Monday, while General Electric (GE) is trying to put the skids on a sharp five-day slide that sucked out nearly $28 billion worth of the company's market value.X Meanwhile, oil and gas shares continued to advance in droves as energy prices remain strong. WTI crude oil futures reversed from small early losses and edged 0.2% higher to $63.49 a barrel.Diamondback Energy (FANG), an IBD Leaderboard play, jumped more than 3% to 132.21 and extended gains past a 115.03 buy point to nearly 15%.GE, the focus of a front-page story in the latest IBD Weekly, has a $139 billion market cap and 8.67 billion shares outstanding. At the end of the devastating 2008-09 bear market, GE traded as low as 5.73 a share, equivalent to a $49 billion market value at that time.The Nasdaq 100 — led by 1%-plus gains from tech heavyweights Alphabet (GOOGL), Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) — lifted 0.8%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% while the Dow Jones industrial average lagged, up nearly 0.6%.Apple (AAPL), the largest company on the Nasdaq and a Dow 30 component, fell 0.8% to 177 but volume was dull. The iPhone giant, despite getting new downgrades, is not triggering any sell signals. Shares are up 10% since clearing a fine second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 on Oct. 27, and slightly above the more recent entry at 176.34.The megacap tech recently hopped off its 50-day moving average near 170 three weeks ago, justifying a follow-on buy for holders with a nice profit cushion in the stock.The Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.4%. Volume rose on the Nasdaq and was sharply down on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.GE, part of the 30-stock Dow industrials, is now trading 33% below its 200-day moving average, which too has been falling hard since May of last year. Excluding the brief flash crash of August 2015, the last time GE fell this hard below the important long-term level was all the way back in March 2009, the tail end of the market's severe slide after topping in November 2007.Plus, notice how a rally in early January this year failed to keep GE shares above their 50-day moving average for long. Healthy stocks trade above their 50-day moving average, which in turn leads the 200-day moving average higher. For GE, the opposite is occurring.Technically speaking, GE could find some buyers among the value investing crowd. However, as noted in this GE feature by IBD, GE faces the unenviable task of deciding whether to maintain positions in the power, aviation and health care markets, or to sell more parts of itself to become leaner and meaner.GE's attractiveness as a dividend play has definitely lost its luster after the board approved a 50% haircut in the quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share in November.Within the Dow Jones industrial average, fellow component Verizon Communications (VZ) makes IBD's Dividend Leaders screen. The telecom giant, which has a 4.5% annualized yield and a terrific three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 5 on a scale of zero to 99, rose nearly 2% to 52.89 in fast turnover. A move past 53.79, 10 cents above the high in the handle of a long saucer base, could present a timely buy point.The Street expects Verizon to post a 2% rise in fourth-quarter profit to 88 cents a share on a 3% lift in revenue to $33.25 billion. Results come out Tuesday before the market open. (Check IBD's earnings calendar for other companies set to report results.)Meanwhile, fellow Dow 30 components Intel (INTC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) continue to do well, with gains of 2% each. The former is still forming a new base. The latter appears to be building a shallow new base atop a much longer saucer with handle that furnished a breakout past 247.17 on Nov. 30.Elsewhere in the stock market today, biotechs helped lead the upside following news that French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY) is buying Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for more than $11 billion, while Celgene (CELG) confirmed rumors that it's buying Juno Therapeutics (JUNO).At least 11 of the 463 companies in IBD's biotech industry group hold a solid Composite Rating of 90 or higher and trade at least 10 a share. They include Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which hold an awesome score of 98 and 97, respectively.Ligand ran up nearly 3% to 160.26 in afternoon trading, extending gains from a 149.41 buy point in an eight-week flat base to 7%, so it's a bit extended in price.Vertex, which reports Q4 results on Jan. 31 after the close, is trying to clear stubborn resistance near 160 as it builds a long flat base that could also be viewed as a saucer pattern.

80,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) reversed its third-quarter ""fallout"" Thursday, reporting key inflammation drug Otezla tacked on nearly 22% growth in the fourth quarter, topping the consensus by 10%.X The report contained ""no surprises this time,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. It follows the third quarter in which Celgene stock tanked after Otezla sales broadly missed expectations.For the fourth quarter, though, psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla brought in $371 million in sales, growing 21.6% vs. the year-earlier period. U.S. sales of $303 million grew 13.1% and $68 million in international sales advanced 83.8%. Porges credited the Otezla rebound — up 20.5% quarter over quarter — to volume gains in the U.S.He said the gains ""should be viewed positively after a very disappointing third-quarter result that made many investors question the long-term potential of this product.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Celgene stock gained 1.2% to close at 104.39.Total sales came in at $3.48 billion, growing 16.9% and topping the consensus for $3.46 billion. Adjusted profit increased 24.2% to $2 a share and beat expectations for adjusted income of $1.93 per share.In cancer, Revlimid sales of $2.19 billion beat the consensus by 1%, Porges said. U.S. sales beat by 5%, but outside the U.S. Revlimid sales lagged by 7%. Pomalyst sales were in line at $442 million. Abraxane, though, brought in $251 million and missed by 5%.Celgene guided to $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion in total sales for 2018, lagging the Street view for $14.98 billion. The biotech sees Revlimid, Pomalyst and Otezla growing 15%, 18% and 17%, respectively, vs. the prior year.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen and Celgene kicked off the biotech earnings season on Thursday, but others are expected to provide even more upside. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which biotechs are expected to outperform third-quarter expectations.Adjusted earnings are expected to rise 18% at the midpoint to $8.70-$8.90 per share. The consensus had modeled $8.78. The guidance doesn't include Celgene's planned merger with Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), which is expected to have a 50-cent dilutive impact on earnings.The lead drug from Juno, JCAR017, is expected to be the third in a class known as CAR-T therapies, to hit the market. Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were first. Still, Celgene's plan to acquire long-term partner Juno has been lauded on Wall Street.""In our view, the deal Celgene announced on Monday to acquire Juno was relatively straightforward and made a lot of sense since Celgene already had made significant investment into the CAR-T space,"" Porges said.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report acquiring Juno will help Celgene diversify from its biggest moneymaker Revlimid. Revlimid is expected to begin losing exclusivity in 2022 as key patents expire.He expects ""sentiment in Celgene to shift back positively as fourth-quarter (earnings) and 2018 guidance reaffirms potential for strong near-term growth/execution,"" he said.

81,CELG,"Sanofi's (SNY) second deal in a week could spur a ""robust"" buying period in biopharma, an analyst said Monday after the French drugmaker outbid Novo Nordisk (NVO) for Belgium's Ablynx (ABLX).X The deal comes a week after Sanofi said it would spend $11.6 billion to acquire Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV), a hemophilia drug specialist. Also last week Celgene (CELG) said it would buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) for $9 billion.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says this could signal the beginning of an active time for biopharma deals.""In our view, Sanofi's aggressiveness in mergers and acquisitions may precede a more robust period of deals within biopharma as the effects of U.S. tax reform are felt and valuations for late-stage assets continue to drive higher,"" he said in a note to clients.Specifically, Sanofi plans to spend about $4.8 billion to acquire Ablynx. Ablynx is nearing approval for a drug to treat a rare blood clotting disorder and is already partnered with AbbVie (ABBV), Dow's Merck (MRK), Sanofi and others on a number of potential drugs.""The various partnership programs offer upside to prospects for Ablynx's wholly owned assets,"" Fernandez said. He notes a drug to fight a virus that causes infections of the lungs and respiratory tract is expected to have Phase 2 data in the second half of the year.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts don't expect payers to push back on drugs that treat rare diseases considering the small populations they tend to treat. See which companies are working in this arena by visiting the Industry Snapshot.The acquisition also adds a drug known as caplacizumab to Sanofi's pipeline. The drug is being tested as a treatment for acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, a rare clotting disorder caused by impaired activity in an enzyme.Ablynx estimates the market for the disorder, also known as acquired TTP, to be 1.2 billion euros, or $1.48 billion. It expects to gain approval in Europe in 2018 and in the U.S. in 2019.But Sanofi fell 1% to close at 45.32 on the stock market today. Ablynx, on the other hand, rocketed 12.6% to finish at 53.65. Novo Nordisk, which lost out on its chance to acquire Ablynx, sank 1%, to 57.53.Novo Nordisk had put up a bid of about $2.6 billion earlier this month for Ablynx.RELATED:Why This Biopharma 'Behemoth' Could Soon Become AcquisitiveIntuitive Surgical Dips On Lackluster Guidance, But Analysts BullishWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

82,CELG,"AbbVie (ABBV) could follow in the footsteps of Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG), an analyst suggested Monday after AbbVie guided to an unexpectedly low 9% tax rate in 2018.X ""We expect the narrative for this stock in the coming months to develop into a 'who will it buy?' story, similar to Gilead in 2016 and Celgene more recently,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.The acquisition narrative follows AbbVie's fourth-quarter earnings. On Friday, the biopharma giant topped quarterly expectations and beat 2018 guidance predictions. It also guided to a 9% tax rate in 2018 and a tax rate around 13% in the near-term.It also follows announcements last week that Celgene would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Sanofi (SNY) would acquire Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV). Today, Sanofi also said it will buy Ablynx (ABLX).If AbbVie does seek an acquisition, it will likely be in neuroscience, early-stage immuno-oncology or solid tumor medicine, Porges said. AbbVie could seek deals to build onto or complement its early-stage Alzheimer's disease pipeline ahead of a key readout in 2019.So far, though, AbbVie is playing its cards close to its vest. The firm doesn't seem inclined to make ""large or disruptive"" transactions, Porges said. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted the firm is constantly looking at assets but believes it already has a strong pipeline.Further, ""they do not have a burning platform where they need to acquire an asset,"" he said. ""If there isn't a compelling need and the company is dealing with many other things, it probably is not the best time to do mergers and acquisitions.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene and AbbVie have already reported their fourth-quarter earnings, but a slew of biopharmas are still slated to issue their reports. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what analysts expect from the biotech and drugs groups.That puts AbbVie in a slightly different boat from Gilead and Celgene. Gilead acquired Kite Pharma in 2017 amid slowing hepatitis C drug sales. Last week, Celgene said it would buy Juno four years before it begins losing exclusivity on cancer drug Revlimid.Divan's comments follow a conversation with AbbVie's management post fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts suggested the lower-than-expected 9% tax rate means AbbVie will have extra cash on hand with which it could engage in mergers and acquisitions. AbbVie says it's looking at earlier-stage and single assets to build out its pipeline.""If they find anything in the 2019 or 2020 timeframe, even before the (neuroscience) readouts, they would not necessarily feel the need to wait,"" Divan said in a note to clients.Divan boosted his price target on AbbVie to 135 from 98 and kept his neutral rating. Porges also upped his price target to 127 from 105, though he downgraded AbbVie to a market perform rating from outperform.""At current valuations, we prefer Celgene to AbbVie among the larger cap names in our coverage,"" he said. ""Growth names such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continue to offer more upside, in our view, than AbbVie.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, AbbVie dipped a fraction to 122.31.RELATED:Celgene Reverses In Fourth Quarter As Otezla Sales ReboundCould Sanofi's Ablynx Deal Spur A Biopharma Buying Spree?Will Biotech's Merger 'Spigot' Turn On After Juno, Bioverativ?

83,CELG,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) is a biotech worth $4 billion, but it doesn't market a single drug — yet in 2018 it's expected to approach $200 million in sales and its stock is breaking out.X The reason is Ligand operates under a unique business model in which it acquires early-stage technologies necessary for drug development. It then licenses those platforms out to biotechs and pharmas like Dow Jones stocks Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE), as well as Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis (NVS).In total, Ligand has more than 165 programs in development with north of 95 partners, the firm said during its fourth-quarter conference call in February. Craig-Hallum Capital Group analyst Matt Hewitt praised the model in a Feb. 22 report to clients.""Given a larger-than-ever and expanding portfolio of current and potential future royalty generating assets, a broad pipeline of partnerships, and a model inherently geared to deliver very high profit margins, we believe there is tremendous value creation in motion at Ligand,"" he said.Shareholders seem to agree with Hewitt's assessment. Ligand stock has popped more than 27% since the beginning of the year, outperforming the broader biotech group, which has risen roughly 11% over the same time period.On Thursday, shares jumped in early-morning trades to break out of a second-stage, six-week flat base. Shares ended the regular session up 4% to 174.70.Ligand shares have been on a run since last week, jumping at least 2% per day during a stretch of three straight trading sessions. Meanwhile, the biotech group has been in the red for four of the past seven sessions.The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. In the biotech group, it's ranked third behind Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO), which both have ratings of 99.Ligand demonstrated its dominance in the fourth quarter. Total revenue grew 32.2% to $50.46 million, topping the consensus for $47 million, Roth Capital Partners analyst Scott Henry wrote in a recent note to clients.Royalties, the main driver of sales, increased 44.6% to $28.3 million, in line with expectations, Henry said. The upside to revenue drove adjusted earnings per share of $1.31, spiking 77% vs. the year-earlier quarter and beating analyst views by 25 cents.Better-than-expected sales of Amgen's Kyprolis and Novartis' Promacta led the revenue charge. Ligand gets a 4.7%-9.4% royalty on sales of Promacta, an oral medicine to increase the number of platelets in the blood, and a 1.5%-3% royalty on sales of multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis.In total, Ligand is tied to a dozen commercial products. It has five technology platforms that biotechs and pharmas can use to develop drugs. The firm also has a handful of early-stage drugs it plans to license out to interested companies for further development.Ligand's goal is to create a diversified company ""with more licensing opportunities and lower impact of individual patent expiry,"" the firm says. That protects it from the scenario now facing biotech leader Celgene (CELG) which will see its patents on cancer drug Revlimid begin to expire in the mid-2020s.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

84,CELG,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowAmong its recent successes, Ligand announced this week that it had partnered with drug holding firm Roivant Sciences on diabetes drug LGD-6972. Roivant's company, Metavant, will develop the drug which had strong Phase 2 data in the second half of 2017.""This is a major partnership that has the potential to generate substantial medical value for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients,"" Ligand Chief Executive John Higgins said in a prepared statement. ""If LGD-6972 is successfully developed, this license with Roivant has the potential to be Ligand's largest financial asset with the possibility of annual royalties (continuing) in the late 2030s.""All this could offer upside to 2018 guidance for $116 million in royalty revenue, $23 million in sales related to Captisol — a compound used in pharma development — and $25 million related to milestones and license fees, analysts say.""Ligand tends to under-promise and over-deliver when it comes to annual guidance,"" Roth Capital's Henry said. ""We expect 2018 to be more of the same. Our revenue and (earnings-per-share) targets of $166 million and $4.28, which we view as conservative, should surpass the company's guidance.""Henry expects Kyprolis and Promacta sales to moderate in 2018. He calls for Kyprolis sales to grow 19%, down from 26% in 2017, and for Promacta sales to increase 20%, down from 37% in 2017. Any sustained movement for these drugs could provide upside to the guidance, he said.Ligand, though, is bullish on both drugs. CEO Higgins called for Kyprolis and Promacta to both become blockbusters in 2018. Promacta has been on the market for nine years, so seeing that level of growth is ""particularly impressive,"" he said on the earnings call.""In 2018, Promacta will become a $1 billion molecule, with analysts projecting continued strong growth beyond,"" he said. ""And for Kyprolis, given recently reported sales numbers, that drug appears to us to also be on track to exceed $1 billion in worldwide sales in 2018.""Ligand's partners currently have a handful of drugs in late-stage testing including brexanolone, a postpartum depression drug from Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), and a slew of others in Phase 2 trials. Of its partnered programs, 42% are preclinical and 25% are in Phase 1 studies.The firm expects to benefit from current trends including the new U.S. tax law, which reduced Ligand's projected tax rate by more than one-third, Higgins said on the earnings call. Ligand also will get a boost from a bump in FDA drug approvals.A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found the success rate of drug programs advancing to approval has increased.""We believe this can be attributed to many factors, including better decisions with advancing programs and a more favorable regulatory environment,"" he said. ""This is very meaningful for Ligand, as we have over 165 programs at all stages of development.""RELATED:How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

85,CELG,"A couple of relatively obscure biotechs are challenging the likes of Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) with a new form of treating cancer that not only could undercut their bigger rivals, it could render recently approved oncology drugs from those drug giants obsolete.X Novartis and Gilead are still in the early stages of launching their respective drugs called Kymriah and Yescarta, which are known as CAR-T drugs. But Cellectis (CLLS) and Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) — each with a tiny fraction of their rivals' market cap — already are creeping in with an off-the-shelf variation on CAR-T therapy that uses healthy donor cells to create a less expensive version of these cancer drugs.This could make treatments from Novartis and Gilead ""less attractive or obsolete,"" Instinet analyst Christopher Marai told Investor's Business Daily.""Never mind pricing. (These) could be dosed more effectively,"" Marai said.CAR-T therapy is a form of oncology treatment currently created by extracting immune cells from a patient's blood. Using an ""empty"" virus, drugmakers affix what are known as chimeric antigen receptors to the immune system T cells.These receptors, also known as CARs, are proteins that can recognize other proteins used by cancer cells to hide in the body. When these re-engineered T cells are reintroduced to the body, they are directed to seek out and destroy cancer cells carrying those proteins.But the process is complex and costly. It's also tailored to individuals, meaning these drugs can't be mass produced and often take weeks to manufacture. Some patients die while they're waiting, Crispr Chief Executive Sam Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily.His off-the-shelf approach to CAR-T is aiming to change that.Off-the-shelf CAR-T, also known as allogeneic, uses healthy donor cells to prompt the same immune response as first-generation CAR-Ts that Novartis and Gilead are using, known as autologous. Kulkarni says the donor cells are typically healthier, allowing for a more robust response in patients.The manufacturing process is less complex and, from one run, could make hundreds of doses, Kulkarni said. And because the process is uniform, it's less costly. Cellectis has estimated its cost of goods at less than $5,000 per patient. Autologous CAR-T runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, experts say.Kulkarni and Marai note the benefits of allogeneic CAR-T could be huge if the theory pans out in late-stage clinical testing.Healthy donor cells could also prompt a better response than using compromised T cells from a cancer patient, they say. Patients could also potentially receive repeat doses if the benefit doesn't persist from one dose. That's difficult with the much pricier autologous CAR-T.""Overall, allogeneic is so much more powerful because it's off-the-shelf,"" Kulkarni said. ""A patient can be treated the very next day. They (allogeneic CAR-Ts) have a good chance of working better than autologous CAR-Ts and they can be accessible broadly to patients.""But this theory is still a little short in the tooth. In December, Cellectis with partners Servier and Pfizer (PFE), a Dow Jones industrial average component, unveiled the results of its first clinical trial that used donor cells to create a CAR-T treatment for a form of leukemia.Brad Loncar, who runs the biotech fund known as Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR), called the results mixed. In patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the drug known as UCART19 resulted in an 83% complete remission rate across adult and pediatric patients.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

86,CELG,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowThe data weren't as strong as results from Juno Therapeutics — formally acquired by Celgene (CELG) earlier this week — when it was at that point. In Phase 1 data presented in December 2016, Juno's JCAR017, a first-generation CAR-T drug, achieved a 93% remission rate in children with the same form of leukemia.""If they had equal (effectiveness), of course the off-the-shelf CAR-T would make (first-generation CAR-T) obsolete,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""If they have equal (effectiveness), that's a gigantic thing to say and it's far from proven. And there's reason to believe that it will never be so.""Allogeneic CAR-T could be the ""holy grail"" of oncology therapies, said Nadeem Sheikh, vice president of research and development for privately held Dendreon Pharmaceuticals. Dendreon makes an immunotherapy treatment called Provenge for advanced prostate cancer.""The entire cancer field would love something like an allogeneic approach,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""The allogeneic approach is: I could take your cells and give them to me. That's the holy grail. But we know there's a lot of problems with that approach.""Using a donor's cells could introduce the potential for a condition known as graft-versus-host disease, Sheikh said. With that disease, the donor immune cells don't recognize their surroundings and begin to indiscriminately attack everything that appears foreign.Crispr's Kulkarni thinks he has the answer. The company's gene editing process uses a technique called CRISPR in which a receptor on the donor's T cells is removed, preventing those cells from wildly attacking unintended targets.""Essentially, by using CRISPR we change the genetics of the healthy donor's T cells,"" he said. ""When we do that, they no longer will indiscriminately attack the patient's cells. They only attack the tumor within the patient.""By performing a second edit, the donor T cells are then engineered to appear as if they belong in the body so the patient's own immune cells won't try to destroy the donor cells, Kulkarni said. This allows the donor cells to persist longer in the body.""Think of CRISPR as like a blow torch,"" he said. ""You can actually cut metal and weld metal with it. Here, we can either add genes or remove genes from a cell. Essentially we take a healthy person's T cells and make the CAR-Ts by adding or subtracting genes.""Cellectis is in a class of its own in allogeneic CAR-T, Loncar said. Its Servier/Pfizer-partnered drug, UCART19, already has preliminary Phase 1 data. Its own drug, UCART123, is in testing in acute myeloid leukemia and a form of leukemia known as blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.In February, Cellectis was granted a pair of U.S. patents to use CRISPR gene editing for the genetic engineering of T cells. Cellectis said it plans to make these patents available for licensing to other companies willing to use CRISPR technology in T cells.The theory is catching on quickly, even among the biggest first-generation CAR-T players. Gilead announced its acquisition of Kite in late August. The merger closed on Oct. 3 just before the FDA approved Kite's drug Yescarta on Oct. 18. Now Gilead is eyeing the allogeneic approach.Last month, Gilead partnered with Sangamo Therapeutics (SGMO) for $150 million up front to develop cellular therapies using a technique of gene editing called zinc finger nucleases. This process of gene editing is more complex and costly than the CRISPR technology used by Crispr, Editas Medicine (EDIT) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA).Under terms of its deal with Gilead, Sangamo is eligible for up to $3.01 billion in potential payments across 10 or more products. The two will work on autologous and allogeneic approaches to cellular therapy.Crispr, the biotech, also is working on an allogeneic CAR-T therapy called CTX101. Like Yescarta from Gilead and Kymriah from Novartis, it targets the CD19 protein, meaning it could potentially be used to treat similar blood cancers. So far, the firm has had three meetings with the FDA to discuss filing an investigational new drug application, Kulkarni said.Such an application would allow Crispr to begin a clinical trial. Kulkarni expects to file an application by the end of the year to begin clinical testing in 2019. He's bullish on Crispr's prospects, but notes it will ""take a lot of up-front time and energy.""""I think we're still in early days,"" he said. ""We have to see how the data bear out and autologous CAR-T has a head start with a number of trials. But if allogeneic starts working in one tumor type, it's a very scalable program.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

93,CELG,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS), Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) could stoke acquisitive appetites in 2018 as large-cap biotechs struggle with slowing growth and major patent cliffs, analysts said Tuesday.X Deal-making has slowed since hitting a record high in 2015, RBC analysts said in a note to clients. The number of deals valued above $1 billion hit 17 two years ago. This year, there have been six of those mergers, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) $11.9 billion takeover of Kite Pharma.Investors had expected Gilead's major buy to stoke more acquisitions. When that didn't come to fruition, biotech stocks suffered. But ""pent-up demand"" could prompt mergers and acquisitions to play out next year, analysts say.""Many large-cap companies generate a disproportionate share of overall revenues from a handful of blockbuster drugs — many of which are facing impending patent cliffs in the coming years,"" RBC's note said. ""The need to make up for lost sources of revenue and stimulate growth may encourage future M&A.""Gilead bought Kite after suffering major declines in its hepatitis C drug unit. But its HIV drug, tenofovir alafenamide, is likely to lose patent protection in 2025. Celgene's (CELG) cancer drug Revlimid is facing patent cliffs in 2024-26. Amgen's (AMGN) anti-inflammatory Enbrel is likely to lose protection in 2019.These three also had the most cash on hand as of their recent updates. Amgen reported $41.35 billion, Celgene had $11.76 billion and Gilead noted $29.07 billion. The remainder of large-caps in the biotech realm had under $4 billion each.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts said Monday that large-cap biotech franchises will feel the pain of competition in 2018 amid a speeding number of rival branded and generic drug approvals. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what this could mean for the likes of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Gilead and Amgen.Overall, cash positions are nearing a five-year high, analysts say. Tax reform could help. Under the most recent proposal, companies can repatriate earnings at as a 15.5% tax rate. Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) have an excess of 90% of their cash currently overseas.""However, we think it's unlikely that the majority of overseas cash would be repatriated immediately upon institution of tax reform,"" RBC analysts said. Celgene, for instance, has suggested a chunk of its foreign earnings are expected to be reinvested permanently outside the U.S.Analysts also note the average projected revenue for the next seven years for mid-cap biotechs is likely to do little to offset the losses from patent cliffs. Performance of acquirers over the past two years has been poor. Industry checks also indicate large deals are on the outs — Gilead/Kite being the exception.Still, expectations are high for mergers and acquisitions, analysts say. In a recent survey, investors cited M&A as the biggest tailwind for the group. Drug pricing is expected to be the biggest headwind in 2018. RBC analysts are slightly bullish on M&A and slightly bearish on drug pricing.""With expectations high for M&A as a major tailwind for the sector, if it does not materialize in the first half of 2018, we could see broad downside,"" RBC said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, too, notes M&A will be important for the Big Pharma group and that it will likely come as a result of changes in tax rates for repatriation. His top pick for 2018 is J&J, though he also expects Dow's Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) to rebound.""Additional funds for dividend growth and share repurchases should also boost the overall outlook for the sector from an investor perspective,"" he said. ""We see the regulatory environment remaining generally favorable and providing more rapid paths to market for products that bring real innovation.""RELATED:Beware: Price Wars For Big Pharma, Biotech Companies On HorizonThis Biotech Stock Seen As Cheapest Among Rivals In Cancer DrugsGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

94,CELG,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages rallied at record highs during the week. ASML (ASML), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and other chip plays surged on earnings. Apple will pay $38 billion in taxes, pay employee bonuses and step up its manufacturing investment fund as it repatriates massive overseas cash holdings. General Motors (GM) was upbeat about the future while Ford Motor (F) was not. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) kicked off health insurance earnings, and led many insurers' stocks to record highs. Cancer drug trial data and M&A buzz moved drug stocks. But General Electric (GE) crashed to a fresh six-year lows amid a huge new charge and speculation that the conglomerate may break up.X The Dow and Nasdaq rose 1% for the week while the S&P 500 climbed 0.9%, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hitting record highs on Friday. Chip-gear makers led the way, fueled by ASML (ASML) and others. Health insurers also were big winners as UnitedHealth (UNH) triggered a group rally. Energy stocks pulled back while lithium plays also sold off.Apple (AAPL) is expected to bring home $245 billion in foreign profits banked overseas to help pay for domestic projects, thanks to recently enacted U.S. corporate tax reforms. Apple pledged to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years. That includes creating 20,000 new jobs, funding a new campus and more data centers, and forging deals with U.S. component manufacturers. Analysts say Apple likely will use some of the foreign cash for tuck-in acquisitions and to increase stock buybacks and dividends.The semiconductor equipment group led all industries for the week. ASML Holding (ASML), Ichor Holdings (ICHR) and Electro Scientific Industries (ESIO) rallied on upbeat financial reports. ASML reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and Ichor and Electro Scientific each announced preliminary December-quarter sales that topped views. Chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) added to the party by delivering better-than-expected fourth-quarter results and guiding to strong sales growth in 2018.General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery said he's mulling a breakup into separate businesses, after the industrial giant announced it will take a $6.2 billion charge in the fourth quarter on its legacy insurance business — double earlier guidance. The charge relates to an old long-term-care portfolio. GE's finance arm will pay $15 billion through 2024 to shore up reserves, raising worries that GE's industrial businesses may have to prop up GE Capital with cash at some point. Flannery will update investors on the portfolio review in the spring. Activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management reportedly is pushing for a GE breakup. GE shares tumbled 13.3% to 16.26, their lowest level in more than six years, as investors questioned whether the last original Dow component has much value.GM (GM) expects 2018 earnings to be largely in line with expected 2017 results, in the high end of the $6-6.50 range. The largest U.S. carmaker expects profits to rise in 2019 and beyond, as it shifts its lineup toward more profitable, next-gen SUVs and trucks. Analysts had expected about $6.24 for 2017 and EPS declines in 2018 and 2019. Ford (F) went the other way, forecasting 2017 earnings of $1.78 per share, below estimates. It expects EPS to dip in 2018, to $1.45-$1.70. Ford said Monday it will invest $11 billion in electric vehicles over the next four years, more than doubling an earlier target. GM shares fell 2.1%, with Ford plunging 9.3%, below a recent buy point.Charles Schwab (SCHW) earnings per share and revenue both rose 14%, both meeting views. New retail brokerage accounts jumped 36% vs. a year earlier, helping total accounts grow 4% to 7.4 million. Smaller online brokerage Interactive Brokers (IBKR) saw earnings spike more than 500%  as revenue jumped 167%, both beating. Customer accounts grew 25% and total daily trades 14%. Shares of Schwab rose a fraction for the week while Interactive fell 1%.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) helped spark the Dow's run to 26,000, breaking out 6.4% to a record high after easily clearing Q4 earnings estimates and detailing the impact of tax reform. UnitedHealth earnings jumped 23% to $2.59 a share on 9.5% revenue growth. While the nation's largest insurer said it plans to use its tax windfall to boost investment, UnitedHealth expects 75% of the benefits of tax cuts to go to the bottom line. It's projecting 2018 EPS of $12.30 to $12.60, a range of 22% to 25% profit growth. Other health insurers rallied to new highs on UnitedHealth's strong report.Airbus (EADSY) had 1,109 orders last year, up 52% from 2016, beating Boeing (BA) for the sixth straight year. The European aerospace giant also will keep making the superjumbo A380 after Emirates airline made a $16 billion order at list prices. CEO Tom Enders was critical of Brexit and President Trump's ""America First"" policies but said Brexit would be more devastating to the Airbus' business. Boeing announced a joint venture with auto car seat maker Adient (ADNT) to build seats for its jets to ease congestion from Zodiac Aerospace that has delayed plane deliveries.Bitcoin fell well below $10,000 on Wednesday before rebounding to about $11,700 as of Friday morning. South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon spooked cryptocurrency markets saying that banning trading in digital currencies was ""a live option."" BitConnect will shutter its lending services and exchange platform. While central banks warn of excessive risk with Bitcoin, companies are embracing cryptocurrencies. IBM (IBM) announced a blockchain joint venture with the Danish shipping company Maersk.Goldman Sachs (GS) topped EPS and revenue views for Q4, but its large fixed-income desk saw a 50% revenue drop, once again worse than rivals. Bank of America had mixed results, while Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup (C) results beat. As Bitcoin's value continued to shrink this week, Goldman CFO Martin Chavez said it was responding to clients' interest in the cryptocurrency, but exercising ""extreme prudence and caution."" He did not say anything about whether the bank, which has already said it would clear Bitcoin futures, would develop a crypto-trading platform of its own. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan said ""customers should be careful"" with cryptocurrencies.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) stock rocketed 52% on Wednesday on a report that longtime partner Celgene (CELG) is in talks to acquire it. Celgene and Juno are partnered to develop CAR-T drugs, rivaling the likes of Gilead Sciences (GILD), which recently bought Kite Pharma, and Novartis (NVS). Celgene blockbuster faces its multiple myeloma drug Revlimid going off patent. Bluebird Bio (BLUE), another CAR-T developer that partners with Celgene, rose 7.3% on Wednesday.Dow stock Merck surged Tuesday after it released the results of a trial for immuno-oncology drug Keytruda and chemotherapy in advanced lung cancer well ahead of expectations. In October, Merck had delayed the release until 2019. In the Phase 3 trial, Merck's regimen significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival as a first treatment vs. chemotherapy alone. Roche (RHHBY), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN), which have rival drugs, retreated Tuesday.Atlassian (TEAM) topped fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue estimates. But the collaboration software maker forecast current-quarter profit of 8 cents a share on revenue of $218 million vs. consensus estimates of 11 cents and $215 million. Analysts said the light guidance was due to annual salary increases and higher payroll taxes. Jefferies hiked its price target to 64 from 53 on expectations for better future cash flow growth. Shares, which had jumped into the buy zone earlier in the week, tumbled 4.55%, just below the entry point.Initial jobless claims fell to a 45-year low as labor markets continue to tighten.

Meanwhile the New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing index dipped in January while the Philly Fed gauge set a 13-month low, led by new orders. Housing starts tumbled in December but permits were strong while homebuilder confidence remained near a 13-year high this month.The aluminum giant's Q4 profit swelled 643% to $1.04 a share as revenue rose 25% to $3.17 billion. But analysts had expected $1.23 a share on revenue of  $3.29 billion. Alcoa (AA) said it sees 4.25%-5.25% in global aluminum demand growth for 2018. Shares dove 6.45%.Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO), have been climbing after Bernstein analysts predicted 22%-24% year-over-year gross gambling revenue gains in Macau for January. That would be the best growth since July. Macau's gaming revenue took an unexpected hit in December, thanks to VIPs on a win streak, but revenue still rose 19.1% in 2017, breaking a three-year period of annual declines amid a government crackdown on corruption.Rail operator CSX topped on earnings but missed on sales. The report was the first since the December death of its CEO Hunter Harrison, a veteran railroad executive known for reining in costs and turning around some of CSX's rivals. CSX said performance continued to strengthen in Q4, ""building upon the scheduled railroading model"" launched under Harrison. Kansas City Southern (KSU) missed EPS views. Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) topped on profit and revenue. CSX and Kansas City Southern shares fell, Canadian Pacific rose.Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM) reached a deal with Chile that will let it expand lithium production.

(FMC) 8.2% and Global X Lithium and Battery Tech ETF (LIT) 6.2%.American Express (AXP) will suspend its buyback program in the first half of this year, after a one-off write-down on some assets and a repatriation tax from the GOP's new tax bill dented fourth-quarter profits and capital. AmEx topped Q4 profit and revenue estimates. AmEx fell 1.8% Friday but closed above its 50-day line.IBM (IBM) revenue rose 4% vs. year earlier to $22.5 billion, snapping a 24-quarter streak of flat or declining revenue, as IBM undergoes a major overhaul. Despite topping Q4 views, IBM shares fell 4% Friday following big gains earlier in the week.Amazon.com (AMZN) raised its monthly Prime membership to $12.99 from $10.99. Existing monthly Prime members will face the new rate after Feb. 18. Annual Prime memberships are still $99.

95,CELG,"No franchise is safe in 2018 among large-cap biotechs, which are feeling pressure as the Food and Drug Administration speeds approvals for rival branded and generic medicines, analysts said Monday.X The theme is a continuation from 2017, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.""Despite the near-record number of drug approvals, the large-cap biopharmaceutical sector fell out of a favor with investors, with no names more punished than those with concentrated product portfolios and looming branded or generic competitors,"" he said.Heading into 2018, management confidence is low as revenue trajectories for high-profile products face a slowdown courtesy of payers and competitive pressures. Porges doesn't see the uncertainty lifting in 2018 — and ""possibly not ever.""In 2017, competitive pressures slugged the likes of Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Celgene is feeling the pain in its inflammation unit amid mounting competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS), as Gilead sees a rival for its hepatitis C drug sales in AbbVie (ABBV).Early next year, Porges expects guidance from the lion's share of large-cap biotechs to be conservative. The most stock-moving guidance will come from Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Gilead, he predicted.Alexion is working on a drug dubbed ALXN1210 to treat a pair of rare blood diseases. It's also undergoing a restructuring. Meanwhile, Gilead's hepatitis C franchise will again come under the microscope even as it attempts to pivot further into HIV with its drug bictegravir.""We believe there is $16 per share of value in Gilead's stock for hepatitis C, and the stock price could move up or down 5% if hepatitis C revenue guidance meaningfully differs from the consensus $5.5 billion to $6 billion estimate,"" Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Small-cap biotechs performed well in the third quarter, but large-caps suffered mounting competitive concerns. See how that translated in the stock prices by visiting the Industry Snapshot.He noted AbbVie's plans for hepatitis C products are likely to hurt Gilead stock. AbbVie recently launched Mavyret to treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C. AbbVie will likely provide guidance on its fourth-quarter call ahead of Gilead.Porges expects 2018 sales outlooks from Celgene, Alexion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead, Amgen (AMGN) and AbbVie to miss analyst estimates. Biogen (BIIB) could provide an outlook that encompasses analyst views, he said.Later in the year, the large-cap universe will face political pressure, Porges predicted.""By midyear the congressional midterm elections will be underway, and these campaigns are likely to renew the focus on pharmaceutical companies and their pricing policies,"" he said. ""We continue to favor stocks of companies that are structural demand growth stories, with products protected by commercial, scientific, clinical or legal barriers to entry.""For 2018, his top picks are Vertex and Alexion.Another Leerink analyst, Michael Schmidt, pegs Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) as his top picks among small- and midsize biotechs focused on treating cancer.This group of stocks has outperformed the broader biotech market by 52% thus far in 2017, Schmidt wrote in a note to clients. This dynamic is set to continue in 2018 in a ""favorable regulatory environment"" and as large caps expand their portfolios via acquisitions.In 2018, Incyte (INCY), Seattle Generics (SGEN), Exelixis (EXEL), Clovis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Puma and Array Biopharma (ARRY) are set to launch key products. He counts nine in the group set to unveil pivotal trial results and pending regulatory decisions for a total of seven firms.Emerging technologies remain of interest. CAR-T therapy, which trains a patient's immune cells to fight cancer, and precision oncology had a strong 2017. But success in immuno-oncology combinations, cancer vaccines and certain antibodies has only been modest.""We think next-generation antibody-drug conjugates could be an underappreciated re-emerging area of interest in 2018, representing a clinically validated category but with significant room for upside,"" Schmidt said.Antibody-drug conjugates are antibodies linked to cell-killing agents. The antibody binds to specific marks at the surface of a cancer cell. ImmunoGen (IMGN), Mersana Therapeutics (MRSN) and Seattle are working in this area with the latter the furthest along, he said.RELATED:Why Big Pharma And Biotech Companies Are Girding For A Pricing 'Knife Fight'Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

96,CELG,"Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) is now the ""cheapest"" player now developing CAR-T cancer medications, an analyst said Wednesday as he downgraded rival Bluebird Bio (BLUE).X Both are working on CAR-T therapies in which a patient's immune cells are extracted, taught to fight cancer and then reintroduced to the body. Juno and Bluebird each had strong data during the American Society of Hematology conference in Atlanta.But Juno's data for its drug, JCAR017, was just incremental, Maxim analyst Jason McCarthy said in a note to clients. JCAR017 was tested in patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.""While the response rates were positive, we believe the expectation was that we would see more data and in more patients,"" he said.Shares of Juno lost 22% over two days following its presentation. Over that time, Juno saw its market cap drop to around $5.2 billion from nearly $6.7 billion. On Wednesday, the stock was valued near $5.4 billion.Meanwhile, Bluebird stock popped nearly 18% on Monday, helping its valuation rise to nearly $9.3 billion from almost $7.9 billion. On Wednesday, its market cap was close to $8.4 billion.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Bluebird sank 3.2% to finish at 184.90. Juno climbed 3.6% to end the regular trading session at 47.41.McCarthy downgraded Bluebird to a hold rating, though he kept his 200 price target on the stock. He reiterated his buy rating and 56 price target on Juno.""Juno now has the best value in the space, in our view: With Kite acquired for $12 billion and Bluebird now at almost $9 billion, Juno at $5 billion seems 'cheap' if you can call a $5 billion market capitalization for a company with no revenues 'cheap,' "" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Presentations at the American Society of Hematology prompted volatility in the biotech space this week, with some rocketing as others fell hard. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at the week's winners and losers.The company has north of $1 billion in cash, manufacturing capabilities, a drug pipeline and Celgene (CELG) as its partner, McCarthy said. Catalysts in 2018 include more data for JCAR017 and other CAR-T drugs, including pivotal trials.Bluebird remains a significant player in both CAR-T and gene therapy, but isn't likely to continue seeing a spike in its valuation, McCarthy said. It too is partnered with Celgene.McCarthy's model already assumes the firm sees success for its sickle cell disease and multiple myeloma drugs, supporting a 200 price target. Additional news on its drugs isn't expected until spring 2018.""While we could factor in additional market share or success in regions like China and Japan, we don't believe that the ASH data, while impressive, justifies these changes at this time,"" he said.RELATED:This Biotech Stock Rocketed On Human Trials For New Cancer DrugWhy This Biotech Stock Is Defying A Hematology-Related PitfallWhy Gilead Could Have 'Greatest' Ever In HIV Drug Launches

Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers.

98,CELG,"Biogen (BIIB) is a ""safe"" large-cap biotech to own in 2018, an analyst said Thursday after the firm issued bullish full-year guidance and topped fourth-quarter sales forecasts, though adjusted profit lagged expectations and shares were up only slightly.X Still, investors have yet to fully grasp future competitive dynamics surrounding Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS)-partnered spinal muscular atrophy drug, Spinraza, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.""Overall, nothing in the quarter that we see changes the perception of Biogen as a 'safe' large-cap name to own in 2018, though we do believe potential longer-term MS and SMA competition may be underappreciated,"" he said.In the fourth quarter, Biogen brought in $3.31 billion in total sales and adjusted profit of $5.26 per share, up a respective 15% and 4% on a year-over-year basis. Analysts had seen revenue of $3.07 billion and adjusted earnings of $5.44 a share.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond blamed the earnings miss on a 29-cent impact related to an impairment charge Biogen had to take on multiple sclerosis drug Zinbryta.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen has a high IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a best-possible 99. This means it performs in the top 10% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still isn't ranked first in the biotech group. To see which stock does, visit IBD Stock Checkup.For the year, Biogen guided to $12.7 billion to $13 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $24.20-$25.20 a share. Both metrics easily topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $12.66 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $23.86 per share.Guidance suggests Biogen has ""room for additional growth in 2018,"" RBC's Abrahams said.""We believe (this) will drive continued perception of Biogen as a lower-risk large-cap name for 2018,"" he said. ""Margin guidance was generally in line with expectations, though tax rate will be slightly higher than we had modeled.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen gained 2.1% to close at 353.74.Total Spinraza sales of $363 million beat consensus views of $326 to $332 million, according to analysts with Instinet and Leerink. U.S. sales of $218 million were just above expectations for $216 million, Instinet analyst Christopher Marai said in a report.Outside the U.S., Spinraza brought in $144 million in sales, which topped the Street view for $110 million, Marai said. In international markets, the lion's share of growth came from Germany, Turkey and Japan.That's where RBC's Abrahams sees near-term growth for Spinraza. When patients first go on Spinraza, they receive four loading doses with maintenance doses administered every four months following — meaning in the first year of treatment patients receive six doses.Spinraza was approved in the U.S. in December 2016. Many patients are now receiving the maintenance dose every four months.""U.S. sales continue to show lower growth potential as patients convert from loading to maintenance doses and new patient starts decline quarter-over-quarter, a dynamic we believe may still be underappreciated for some,"" he said.Biogen and Ionis are also facing a potential competitor in the future from AveXis (AVXS), which is working on a gene therapy known as AVXS-101, to treat some types of spinal muscular atrophy.Biogen's multiple sclerosis portfolio brought in combined sales of $2.22 billion, 2% higher than the consensus view for $2.17 billion, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. The biggest outlier was Tysabri, which brought in $463 million in sales, beating views by 4%.Tecfidera, Biogen's biggest multiple sclerosis drug, grew 7% to $1.08 billion and beat analysts' collective view by 3%, Porges said. But this number was somewhat tempered by the fact that the fourth quarter was helped by a $20 million inventory build, Piper Jaffray's Raymond said.So far, Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise isn't suffering from the launch of Roche's (RHHBY) Ocrevus, RBC's Abrahams said. Ocrevus is unique in that it's approved to treat relapsing and primary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Most drugs are just approved to treat the relapsing form.In the near future, Porges expects competitive launches to pressure Biogen's multiple sclerosis unit. Novartis (NVS) will lose exclusivity on Gilenya in 2019, meaning generics will come into play. Celgene (CELG) is also expected to have a new drug, ozanimod, in 2018.RELATED:Why Valeant's 162% Climb Over Nine Months 'Makes No Sense'Abbott Spikes To Record After Topping Quarterly ExpectationsNovartis Tops A High After Crushing Fourth-Quarter Expectations

102,CELG,"Stocks were once again off to strong start Wednesday, after an early rally on Tuesday eroded into a bearish reversal.X The Dow Jones industrial average staked out an early lead, up 0.5% and just below the 26,000 level. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 each added 0.4%.But after Tuesday's losses, with the market due for a breather and as federal lawmakers wrestled to fashion a spending extension to keep the government operating after a Friday night budget deadline, wary investors were also watching for weak spots in Wednesday's early gains.Apple's (AAPL) decline further below its buy point, General Electric's (GE) continued weakness and Goldman Sachs' (GS) early loss following its fourth-quarter report raised red flags against the opening gains. Another early flag came from Ford Motor (F), which slumped nearly 5% after the company revised its 2017 earnings outlook to below analysts' targets late Tuesday, and said its restructuring effort would take longer than initially expected.IBM (IBM) bolted 2.7% higher, to lead early action on the Dow. Barclays raised the stock to an overweight rating, from underweight. IBM announced Tuesday plans to launch a blockchain joint venture with Dutch shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk Group, as a means of tracking and managing the company's shipping containers across the entire industry.IBM shares are up 21% from an August low, climbing the right side of a possible 11-month base pattern.Apple slumped 0.4% after a downgrade to neutral, from buy, from Longbow Research. The stock slunk below its 176.34 buy point Tuesday, and has been fighting to decisively clear that mark since mid-December.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) swept up 47% ahead of the open, after news reports said the company was discussing a possible takeover by Celgene (CELG). The two companies have partnered on a number of drugs, including a CAR-T cancer treatment. The report said a deal could be reached in coming weeks. Celgene shares dipped 1.3% in premarket action.In earnings news, Bank of America (BAC) rose 0.2%, Charles Schwab (SCHW) slipped 0.5% and Pinnacle Financial Partners (PNFP) was unchanged after reporting quarterly results.Goldman Sachs slipped 0.6%, after reporting above-forecast earnings and a smaller-than-expected revenue decline. But currency, commodities and fixed income trading revenue sunk 50% below year-ago levels, and revenue from equity trading was off 14%. Goldman remained in a buy range late Tuesday, above a 247.17 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.U.S. Bancorp (USB) trimmed its early gain to a fraction. The Minneapolis-based bank's fourth-quarter performance was stronger than expected, boosted by a surge in retail leasing revenue. The stock ended Tuesday at the very top of a buy range above a 54.45 cup-with-handle buy point.Chip equipment maker ASML Holding (ASML) powered up nearly 6%. The Netherlands-based outfit reported strong fourth-quarter revenue and earnings beats, although management's first-quarter revenue guidance was below consensus expectations.The stock briefly cleared a cup-base buy point at 186.47 in strong trade on Tuesday, but closed a fraction below that entry. The base is a second stage pattern. Wednesday's premarket move implies a starting-bell breakout, although not all premarket moves carry over into regular trade.Bitcoin continued its sell off, trading just below $9,600, down 16% vs. late Tuesday's levels, according to Coinbase. Cryptocurrency and blockchain-related stocks were under mild pressure:Industrial production rose 0.9% in December, according to the Federal Reserve. That was up from a 0.1% slip in November, and more than double consensus estimates for a 0.4% increase. Factory capacity utilization surged to 77.9%, vs. 77.2% in November and estimates for an uptick to 77.3%.The January Builder's Confidence Index at 10 a.m., the Energy Information Administration reports weekly oil inventories data at 10:30 a.m. and Fed's Beige Book report at 2 p.m. ET.Overseas, China's markets posted modest gains, just enough for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index to top its October 2007 record and move to new highs.

103,CELG,"Stocks fell from new highs Tuesday as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) reversed lower, and Bitcoin sank further.X SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slid 0.3%, PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) slipped 0.2% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) was fractionally lower. Small caps got slammed as iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) tumbled 1.1%.Apple cleared a 176.34 flat-base entry on Friday, though in below-average volume. While the iPhone maker is still above the buy point, its relative strength has lagged and remains near its consolidation lows. Microsoft's RS line has been flat despite its recent advance to record highs.Among sector funds, real estate and healthcare and semiconductor led the upside in the stock market today. Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) rose 0.6% to a record high. Component stock Merck, which led the Dow industrials, popped 6% to retake its 200-day moving average. That marked its best level in nearly three months. The drugmaker's relative strength line is turning up but its RS Rating is a weak 16. Results showed a cocktail of Merck's Keytruda and two chemotherapy drugs stopped lung cancer from advancing and extended patients' lives.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), which is featured later in this column, reversed lower as it builds the right side of a shallow cup-with-handle with a 111.47 buy point.Energy, retail and home construction lagged. West Texas intermediate crude prices slipped 0.6% to $63.89 a barrel.But SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares (IAU) held small gains, after rising to a four-month high on Friday. Gold futures edged 0.3% higher to $1,338.20 an ounce.Bitcoin extended its drop to 15%, to $11,523.95.56, according to CoinDesk, down from an earlier high of $13,601.43. Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum were all getting hit amid continued talk from South Korea about a potential cryptocurrency ban.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) was down 10% after finding support at its 50-day line. It's 49% off its Dec. 19 intraday peak.Large-cap growth funds holding Apple and Microsoft are off to a solid start this year as they continue to stay ahead of the broader market.The top performer, based on its one-year return of 40.7% through Jan. 9, is iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM). The $6.1 billion fund's 4.2% year-to-date gain puts it in third place based on that measure. The S&P 500 was up 3% as of Jan. 9, according to Morningstar Direct.MTUM's top five holdings, which made up 23% of assets, were JPMorgan (JPM), Microsoft, Apple, Bank of America (BAC) and Boeing (BA). Apple, which soared 46% last year, broke out past a 176.34 flat-base entry on Friday. It first cleared the buy point Dec. 18 ahead of a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Microsoft advanced 2% Friday on a price target upgrade from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Shares are at a record  high.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 index, scored a one-year and YTD return of 34.1% and 4.4%, respectively. The 18-year-old fund, which counts Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet as its top five holdings, has amassed nearly $70 billion in assets.Third place went to iShares Russell 2000 Top 200 Growth (IWY), which has gathered $975.2 million in assets since its September 2009 launch. While IWY held the same top five names as QQQ, it was less top-heavy. The top five accounted for 28% of IWY's total assets vs. 39% for QQQ.All three ETFs have low expense ratios: 0.15% for MTUM, 0.20% for QQQ and IWY. They also earn five-star ratings from Morningstar, which indicates how well a fund's returns have compensated investors for the amount of risk it incurs. The ratings range from one to five stars with the best performers, based on risk-adjusted return relative to similar funds, receiving five stars.The three funds are trading at all-time highs and are extended from ideal buy points. In fact, the other ETFs in the accompanying table are also at record highs — not too surprising given we're now in the ninth year of a bull market.IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.So, let's take a look at an ETF that's not on this list nor in the big-cap category, but may be setting up a new base: iShares Nasdaq Biotech. The fund is shaping the right side of a shallow cup-with-handle base with a potential buy point at 111.47. Shares advanced 13% from a June breakout from another shallow base to their Oct. 6 intraday high.The $10.3 billion fund, which tracks the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, will mark its 17th anniversary next month. Biotech represented the biggest sector weight at 82% of assets, pharmaceuticals 11%, life sciences tools and services 6%, with smaller health care-related positions making up the rest.Its top five holdings as of Jan. 11 were Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). The top five stocks accounted for nearly 37% of total assets. Most have outperformed the broader market so far this year: Gilead, Amgen and Biogen have gained 10%, 6% and 5%, respectively vs. the S&P 500's 4% return.IBB's one-year return of 20.4% slightly lags the S&P 500's 24.1% gain. The ETF's average annual return over the past three years lags the benchmark index but leads the S&P 500 during the past five, 10 and 15 years. IBB carries a 0.47% expense ratio.Friday's pick, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV), remains in a buy zone from a Jan. 3 rebound off the 50-day line.RELATED:Apple, Microsoft Fuel Dow To Record; Will Bitcoin Rebound Last?Apple Rises While Bitcoin Dives; Time To Buy Nvidia, AI Stocks?China Hits Stocks; Buffett Vs.

104,CELG,"Invest in the disruptors.That's the advice from Wall Street, as giant biotech companies and the incumbents of Big Pharma are bracing to get crushed by more innovative — and cheaper — new drugs.X What started in 2017 will continue in 2018, analysts say. Generic drug approvals are rising and interesting new medicines are starting to take market share from the legacy makers of medications that consumers use frequently, including both Big Pharma and biotech companies.Blockbuster drugs representing an estimated $17 billion in annual sales are set to lose patent protection over the next decade, analysts say. Disruption will come as generic drugs and innovative new biologic alternatives come on the market.""It will be brutal,"" JMP Securities analyst Mike King told Investor's Business Daily. ""It will be a knife fight.""In the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, King expects Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) to feel the heat from the likes of Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR), The Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Meanwhile, in anti-inflammatory treatments, Celgene's (CELG) Otezla, which gained blockbuster status in 2016, missed sales forecasts by a wide cut in the third quarter. Analysts say newly approved drugs to treat the same conditions from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) are taking market share.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still feeling the pain from the maturing of its hepatitis C drug unit in the U.S. and Europe. The rapid pace of Gilead's hepatitis C sales decline is expected to slow down somewhat, but newer medicines like AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret are likely to swipe some of its sales.Big Pharma isn't getting any help from regulators either. Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb will continue to increase approvals for copycat drugs, stoking competition for both branded and generic drugs facing new rivals as firms try to undercut one another in price.Among the Big Pharma companies, Pfizer (PFE) will be at the forefront feeling the sting of generics taking sales. Earlier this month, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) was allowed to launch a generic copy of the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.Generic drugs tend to be cheaper than their branded counterparts and Viagra is a pricey drug at about $70 per tablet, according to AccessRX. In 2013, after Pfizer lost exclusivity for Viagra in Canada and Europe, worldwide sales fell 8% to $1.88 billion.Today, generics in Europe have slashed the price of drugs containing the same active ingredient as Viagra by about 90%. Generic versions of Viagra cost about a third of the price in Canada. U.S. Viagra prices could also fall if the trend repeats itself with a generic on the market.Teva, meanwhile, is struggling with $34.7 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter. On Thursday, Teva announced a plan to cut its workforce by more than a quarter, close several manufacturing facilities and suspend its dividend on ordinary shares.The firm is also planning to review its generic drug portfolio, most specifically in the U.S., to change prices or discontinue products.IBD'S TAKE: See how giant biotechs fared vs. smaller players in the third quarter by visiting the Industry Snapshot. Hint: The quarter was classified as ""alarming"" for one large-cap biotech which could be in trouble as they see more competition for their traditional moneymakers.Across the board, spending on prescription drugs in 2016 increased by just 3.8% per person, according to a report from Express Scripts (ESRX). That's down from a 5.2% rise in 2015, representing a 27% drop in the growth rate.That trend is likely to continue in 2018, FBB Capital Partners analyst Mike Bailey told IBD. He credits Gottlieb for the decline in generic prices. Gottlieb is running the FDA like a business, which allows for a cycle of more approvals, more competition and lower prices.Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could use their tools to influence pricing, it's unlikely President Trump will use his executive powers to enact sweeping drug-pricing reform such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices or enacting outright pricing controls, Bailey says.""I wouldn't expect any major changes out of the Trump administration in pricing,"" he said. ""I think mechanically and politically it's difficult to get pricing law through the system. It's politically more acceptable to just get more generic drug approvals. It's a win-win.""JMP's King counts drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis as among those in the ""crowded areas."" In 2016, drugs in this class cost an average $3,588 per prescription and benefited from increases in utilization and unit cost, according to Express Scripts.But in the third quarter of 2017, things began to look dour for the likes of Celgene, which missed expectations for its inflammation drug Otezla by 26%. In the U.S., the lag was even sharper at 28%. One analyst suggested Celgene was forced to take a price concession.Celgene also cut its guidance for 2020 after terminating trials of a drug to treat Crohn's disease, a condition that results from chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. It now sees inflammation and immunology drugs bringing in a combined $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020, down from the $4 billion outlook it issued in 2015.Biotech companies and Big Pharma will need to ""get realistic"" on their pricing in these competitive arenas, King says. The same could be said for companies making treatments for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and high cholesterol. All are highly saturated markets.To the latter point, he expects prices for drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Regeneron and Sanofi to be under the microscope. These drugs lower bad LDL cholesterol in the blood. Evidence shows they also have a benefit on some cardiovascular outcomes.Repatha is listed at $14,100 per year, while Praluent costs $14,600. But rivals are closing in. Medicines Co. and Alnylam are working on another cholesterol drug, known as inclisiran. Meanwhile, analysts expect bempedoic acid from Esperion to be cheaper.Some of these Big Pharma and biotech companies ""are probably going to get their arms twisted a lot,"" King said. ""The pricing umbrella has created opportunities for new companies to come in and scale market share. Be careful if you own incumbents. Invest in the disruptors.""Other areas are seemingly immune to pricing pressure, analysts say.In 2016, the price of multiple sclerosis drugs rose an average 7.4%. That's a continuing trend, FBB's Bailey said. The price increases have been so egregious that House Democrats launched an investigation in August, noting that many of these drugs carry price tags north of $85,000 per year.The investigation was launched by Reps. Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch and centers on Bayer (BAYRY), Biogen (BIIB), EMD Sereno, Novartis, Roche (RHHBY), Sanofi and Teva.Among those pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Teva's 20-milligram dose of Copaxone has increased the most, rising 1,002% since its approval in 1996 to an annual price of $91,401 today, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Novartis' Gilenya, approved in 2010, is the highest priced at $91,836.The investigation is ""10 years too late,"" he said. ""It's more difficult to push price control for specialty markets. Multiple sclerosis is a massive market now, but stakeholders view it as a specialty market.""Rare disease and innovative cancer therapies also seem immune to pricing controls, analysts say. For example, earlier this year Novartis and Gilead — via its acquisition of Kite Pharma — gained approval for CAR-T drugs known as Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.CAR-T drugs are developed using a patient's own immune system cells. They are trained to seek out and destroy cancer cells. Kymriah goes for $475,000 per year and Yescarta is listed at $373,000, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy wrote in a recent post.""While gene therapies are beginning to cure cancer, they come at a price that can cause sticker stock,"" she said. ""That said, compared to traditional therapies that suppress, but do not cure cancer, the cost benefit analysis of gene therapy is compelling.""Pricing shock tends to tamp down on excitement for really compelling drugs, Bailey says. The prime example is Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, the first spinal muscular atrophy drug approved. It costs $750,000 in its first year and $375,000 in subsequent years.But sentiment for the biotech companies' shares is already down, he said. So drug pricing concerns shouldn't be a big stock killer in 2018.""In the past when biotech stocks go up quickly, they get new drugs and people are excited, a lot of times someone will throw in a grenade: 'What about drug pricing?'"" Bailey said. ""But sentiment is already down. Even if there's a concern about drug pricing, I see a little less downside.""IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, and has fallen from first just two months ago. Shares collectively neared a two-year high in October, but have since shucked almost 7% from that point.Over that same time, Amgen and Celgene — among the biggest biotechs — have seen their share prices dive 9% and 26%, respectively. Regeneron has taken a 19% hit and Gilead has tumbled 14%.Meanwhile, Alnylam and Esperion, which look likely to rival PSCK9 inhibitor drugmakers like Amgen and Regeneron, have lifted 7% and 5%, respectively. AbbVie, which recently launched a rival to Gilead's hepatitis C franchise, is up 5%.But Novartis and Lilly, which are competing against Celgene to treat inflammatory conditions, have seen their shares retreat, though to a smaller degree. Respectively, their share prices are down 1% and 2%, matching a 1% dip in IBD's 42-company Ethical Drugs industry group.Generic drug stocks, ranked No. 105 out of 197 groups, have actually broadly risen 2% since mid-October. But that's against respective 8% and 5% dips for Teva and Mylan (MYL), its two biggest names.RELATED:Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tTop 6 Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New Awards

106,CELG,"GlycoMimetics (GLYC) defied a hematology biotech pitfall Tuesday, breaking out on strong cancer-drug data as shares of Global Blood Therapeutics (GBT) and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) trended in the opposite direction.X On the stock market today, GlycoMimetics rocketed as much as 27.4% as it rushed past a buy point at 17.04 out of a consolidation. Shares ended the day up nearly 15% to 16.45 following a presentation at a key blood disease conference.But others tumbled on their presentations at the American Society of Hematology conference in Atlanta. Global Blood plummeted 14.2% to close at 38.40, as shares of Spark continued a two-day tumble, falling 6.2% to finish at 44.76.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) toppled nearly 9% to 45.75, as Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) lost 8.7% to 56.08, and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) slid 1.2%, near 54.61.Early Tuesday, GlycoMimetics unveiled results of its drug known as GMI-1271 in two groups of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets.IBD'S TAKE: Several biotech stocks made impressive gains Monday following presentations at the American Society of Hematology. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which stocks popped and which toppled.In patients whose cancer either relapsed or hadn't responded to other therapies, treatment with GMI-1271 resulted in a 43% remission rate. Median overall survival was 9.4 months vs. 5.4 months for historical treatments. Median duration of remission was 11.1 months.For older patients with newly diagnosed disease, the clinical remission rate was 68%. Median overall survival was 15.8 months vs. 12 months for chemotherapy alone, the traditional therapy. Median duration of remission was 14.8 months.Across both groups of patients, GMI-1271 was well-tolerated with no obvious incremental toxicity observed.Late Monday, Global Blood unveiled data from studies of its drug voxelotor in patients with severe sickle cell disease. Hospitalizations for pain associated with the disease fell by 67% during 24 weeks of voxelotor treatment vs. the 24 weeks before therapy.The number of transfusions decreased by 60% during 24 weeks of treatment compared with the 24 weeks before beginning voxelotor. Of six patients who received transfusions before voxelotor therapy, two received no transfusions after treatment.Of the seven patients in the study, two died. Both had co-morbidities and advanced organ injury before treatment with voxelotor. Treating physicians don't believe voxelotor contributed to their deaths.Nomura analyst Christopher Marai noted the drug was well-tolerated and compliance was high because symptoms returned after short periods of discontinuation. He expects voxelotor to fill an unmet need to elderly sickle cell disease patients.Patient deaths underscore the severity of sickle cell disease, he said in a note to clients.""The patients previously responded well to therapy with reduction in transfusions, hospitalization and substantial quality-of-life improvements derived from the drug,"" he said.Spark continued a two-day plunge after closing down 35% on Monday after presenting data from its hemophilia A gene therapy. The drug showed a major reduction in bleeding rates, but showed smaller-than-expected increases of a key clotting protein.Investors compared Spark's drug, known as SPK-8011, to a rival therapy from BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN). SPK-8011 reduced bleeding in the first four hemophilia A patients treated, but demonstrated mixed Factor VIII levels.Factor VIII is the clotting protein missing in hemophilia patients. BioMarin's drug reduced bleeding events. Patients on one dose of BioMarin's drug reached normal Factor VIII levels at 78 weeks. Another group of patients were either in or near that threshold at 48 weeks.But in Spark's trial, one patient had an unexplained spike in Factor VIII levels at 24 weeks. Two patients on a high dose of SPK-8011 both required steroids and had lower Factor VIII levels. A fourth patient on a lower dose continued to have low Factor VIII levels.Juno and Celgene (CELG) presented strong results from a drug known as JCAR017 in patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug is a CAR-T therapy in which a patient's own immune cells are reprogrammed to fight cancer cells.In a Phase 1 trial called Transcend, 74% of patients responded to treatment and all signs of cancer disappeared in 68% of patients at three months. Cancer disappeared completely in half of a core group of patients at six months, Juno said in a press release.Across doses, 80% of core group patients achieved a complete response at three months and stayed there at six months. In that group, 92% still in response at six months remained there as of the data cutoff.Only one of 67 patients experienced an adverse event known as cytokine release syndrome, characterized by flulike symptoms, and 10 experienced neurotoxicity. Both are common side effects associated with CAR-T therapy.Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a report that Juno presented data showing responses across a variety of patients, ""refuting the notion that the strong (effectiveness) achieved in Transcend could have been the result of cherry-picking 'easy patients.' ""Juno, though, is trailing Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), both of which already have CAR-T therapies approved in the U.S.RELATED:Does Gilead's Kite Acquisition Offer A New Buying Opportunity?Biotech Industry: Small Innovators Outflank Big Caps As Blockbuster Drug Patent Cliff LoomsNeurocrine, Exelixis, Juno Stocks Rocket After Crushing Views

107,CELG,"A couple of biotechnology stocks vaulted into double-digit gains Monday after reporting clinical data on blood-disorder medications at an industry conference that pleased investors, with Blueprint Medicines (BPMC) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) adding nearly a fifth to their value.X Atlanta-based Bluebird ended the day up nearly 18% to 201.80 after it reported improvement in patients using its LentiGlobin gene therapy to treat severe sickle cell disease, or SCD, as well as transfusion-dependent beta-thaslassemia, or TDT, both of which are blood disorders. Bluebird said Monday that all seven patients in a study testing the therapy showed more than 45% improvement in hemoglobin levels.""All seven patients in this study continue to experience notable clinical improvement,"" Dr. Marina Cavazzana, a professor of medicine at Paris Descartes University and the primary investigator in the study, said in a news release issued by Bluebird. ""This study suggests that LentiGlobin has the potential to be a transformational one-time therapy for people with SCD and TDT.""That prompted Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter to raise his price target on Bluebird shares to 309, up from 186. Richter also cited positive news for Bluebird's bb2121, now being tested to treat multiple myeloma.But shares dropped more than 2% in after-hours deals to 197 when the company said it would issue $600 million in new shares.The news had the side effect of aiding shares of Celgene (CELG), which were up 1.8% to 108 off Bluebird's news. Celgene is partner with Bluebird on bb2121. But that hurt shares of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), which released data with Celgene on a non-Hodgkin Lymphoma treatment. Juno shares plunged more than 14% to close at 50.24.Meanwhile, Blueprint jumped nearly 23% to 88.32. On Sunday, it reported a response rate of 72% and control rate of 100% in a Phase 1 study of its drug avapritinib to treat another blood disorder, advanced systemic mastocytosis. The disorder can create an uncontrolled number of a type of white blood cell in various organs and can lead to damage or dysfunction.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of both Bluebird and Blueprint gapped up Monday on their result news. Bluebird emerged from a cup base at the end of August and hasn't looked back. Blueprint broke out in early September and has pretty much behaved the same. IBD Relative Strength ratings on the two are 97 and 98, respectively, out of a possible 99. But both are ranked low among stocks in the crowded biotech field. Tops in the sector is Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP).""The new clinical trial results for avapritinib reported at the (American Society of Hematology) plenary scientific session represent an exciting milestone for the systemic mastocytosis community. The data showed a remarkably high response rate and a favorable tolerability profile, suggesting avapritinib has the potential to transform the treatment of this devastating rare disease,"" Dr. Daniel J. DeAngelo, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and an investigator on the trial, said in a news release.Blueprint discussed the results in a conference call Monday.Another biotech stock making big gains off an announcement at the hematology conference was BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), which surged 7.5% to finish at 88.11. It was revealed that Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) gene therapy for hemophilia A lagged that of BioMarin's medication, known currently as valoctocogene roxaparvovec.Shares of Spark plummeted on the news, falling 35% to 47.72. Spark's experimental drug is known as SPK-8011.

109,CELG,"The Nasdaq composite was in the lead in afternoon trading Monday with a 0.5% gain as Wall Street looked past an attempted terrorist attack in New York City.X Dow Jones industrial average stock Apple (AAPL) picked up 2% to 172.75 after the company confirmed it's buying Shazam, a popular song-recognition app, for around $400 million.Technically, Apple looks solid, getting support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout over a 160.97 buy point.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.2% and the S&P 500 added 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Friday's levels in the stock market today.Fiber-optic, coal, mining, solar and oil and gas-related groups outperformed.

According to the CME Group FedWatch tool, the market thinks there's a 90% chance the FOMC will lift the federal funds rate to 1.25% to 1.50%.Buyers came into Tesla (TSLA) as shares rose nearly 4%. Tesla has been struggling lately, but the stock showed positive action Monday, breaking out over a trend line and reclaiming the 50-day moving average.Meanwhile, news of nine Golden Globe nominations wasn't much help to Netflix (NFLX). Shares underperformed, falling 0.3%. The 200 level generally has been a tough level for the stock to conquer. A 190.05 buy point is still in play, although Netflix is also working on a new flat base with a conventional entry of 204.48.Bluebird (BLUE)and partner Celgene (CELG) were winners in the biotech space after Bluebird reported positive trial data for a CAR-T therapy for patients with advanced multiple myeloma. Shares of Bluebird soared 23% while Celgene added nearly 3%.CAR-T drugs are made using a patient's own extracted immune system cells. The cells are reprogrammed to seek and destroy cancer cells.

111,CELG,"The major market indexes turned positive as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) boosted techs. But Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies sank.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) rose 0.4%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gained 0.2% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) was fractionally higher. Small caps led the downside with iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) and iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) dipped 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.Biotech, health care and banks were among the biggest sector fund losers in the stock market today.

VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) advanced 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, on track for their fifth straight up session. Both ETFs have regained their 50-day lines.IBD'S TAKE: It's important for investors to get a feel for just how speculative digital monies like Bitcoin are right now before investing directly in the currencies or through related exchange traded funds or stocks.Among leading chip stocks, Nvidia rose more than 3% and broke out past a 218.77 cup-base entry. It's still in buy range. The graphics chip designer announced Uber as a self-driving partner, as well as new deals with Volkswagen (VLKAY) and Baidu (BIDU). Applied Materials (AMAT) also popped 3%. Needham upgraded the chip equipment maker to strong buy from buy with a 72 price target. Shares regained their 50-day line.Tesla, which also has a partnership with Nvidia, surged 6% to retake its 50-day and 200-day lines in fast trade. Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted over the weekend that he plans to ""put an old school drive-in, roller skates & rock restaurant"" at one of the electric car maker's new Supercharger locations in Los Angeles.Gold funds were lower along with gold futures.

112,CELG,"Beleaguered biotech investors likely will have to wait until 2018 to get some relief, though trial data and drug approvals could help stoke the embers of the formerly red-hot group.X That's the take from analysts, who say there may be some relief on the horizon. But don't expect anything earth shattering, they say.""The next quarter and a half is likely to feature significant disclosures for a number of companies in our coverage, but is unlikely to be a period of strongly stock-moving events,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent note to clients.Porges' view follows a third quarter in which large caps struggled as their historic moneymakers caught the double whammy of increasing competition and pricing concerns. Meanwhile, smaller caps crushed expectations.As a result, IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group, ranked first just a month ago, is now listed as No. 37 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks. Shares touched a 22-month high in October, but have since lost nearly 6%.""However, the flow of events is set to accelerate in early 2018, and the first quarter offers more opportunities for meaningful value inflection across biopharmaceutical companies and stocks,"" Leerink analysts wrote in a recent note.Despite frustration depressing biotech stocks, the group has posted an impressive number of new approvals this year, JMP Securities analyst Mike King said. According to the Food and Drug Administration, 140 original applications for drugs and biologics have been approved this year.""You need product approvals,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""Even the most jaded observer of the sector would have to say the sector as a whole has produced very satisfactory results when it comes to major trial readouts. I don't see any change in that regard.""Tacking on drug approvals and successful data readouts will be key for companies like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), a pair of large biotech leaders facing a growing field of competitors for their moneymakers Revlimid and hepatitis C drugs, respectively.Celgene is set to have two readouts in a type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and could have CAR-T developments from partners Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). CAR-T drugs treat cancer using a patient's own re-engineered immune cells.Both are important for Celgene, which has long enjoyed revenue gains from chemotherapy Revlimid. Analysts had been expecting generic competition from Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) in 2020. Recently, though, Dr. Reddy's missed a key deadline to file its generic.Still, it's less than ideal for Celgene to rely so heavily on one stream of revenue, FBB Partners analyst Mike Bailey said. Celgene had been preparing to replace some of its patent-challenged Revlimid sales with a Crohn's disease drug. But the firm said in October it won't initiate Phase 3 trials of that drug.""The bull case on Celgene previously was that they had these new drugs to limit the risk for Revlimid,"" he told IBD. ""If you take away the risk management piece, all of the focus is on this one drug which is going to go generic at some point.""Similarly, Gilead has an HIV combination using its drug bictegravir set to gain potential approval in February. This could accelerate HIV sales starting in the second quarter, Porges said. At the same time, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy says Gilead will likely get further into CAR-T in 2018. Gilead also announced Thursday its $567 million acquisition of Cell Design Labs, a privately held CAR-T player.In October, Gilead acquired Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion. This followed the FDA's approval of Kite's drug, dubbed Yescarta, to treat large B-cell lymphoma in adults. Due to their individualized nature, CAR-T drugs aren't likely to rake in the same sales as Gilead's now faltering hepatitis C drugs.""But two or three years down the line, that could be a huge revenue maker,"" she told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Big-caps struggled in the third quarter which isn't surprising considering a patent cliff over the next 10 years is set to hit some $17 billion in annual sales for blockbuster drugs, says one analyst. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on how biotechs fared in the period.Yescarta won't replace Gilead's hepatitis C franchise at its peak, but it will grow steadily, Bailey said.""My guess is hepatitis C is going to shrink really quickly,"" he said. ""At some point I would expect CAR-T to replace hepatitis C sales, but no way at the peak. That was once-ever in terms of what Gilead did. It will never be that big.""In the next several months, Leerink's Porges looks for AbbVie (ABBV) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to disclose pivotal trial or regulatory events, while Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) will report more ""value-confirming events.""AbbVie will have data for an anti-inflammatory treatment known as upadacitinib, he said. Those results could add more detail to the evolving landscape of what are known as JAK inhibitors that treat psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis, among a number of conditions.Regeneron is on deck to file the results of its drug Dupixent in asthma. The drug is already approved to treat eczema. The firm could also report data for its eye drug, Eylea, and for its immuno-oncology drug, cemiplimab, in a type of skin cancer.Also, look for Vertex to provide Phase 2 data for two of its triple-pill combinations to treat cystic fibrosis. In total, Vertex is testing four potential regimens to bring into Phase 3 trials. The firm is also likely to gain approval for a two-drug combination in February.In the Big Pharma world, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says there are few significant stock-moving catalysts left in 2017, but the first half of 2018 will be busy.Dow's Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) all have immuno-oncology combo results in lung cancer, while Bristol and Merck/Incyte (INCY) are set to deliver results from their regimens in melanoma.Bristol could also offer interim data from a trial of its immuno-oncology drugs Opdivo and Yervoy as a first treatment for lung cancer.Outside those, ""major immuno-oncology catalysts should (thankfully!) be limited,"" he said. There's a high bar on Bristol's interim data, which require nothing short of stopping the study early on extreme effectiveness. That's unlikely, so expectations are probably low, he said.""Nonetheless, an early stop would be a major validation of Bristol's strategy — likely driving the stock up 15% in our view,"" he said. ""Continuation of the study would likely increase concerns over Bristol's strategy and the ultimate success of the study at the final analysis, possibly pushing the stock down 5%-10%.""PARP inhibitors, yet another class of cancer drugs, are set to have trial results as well. AstraZeneca will have results for its drug, Lynparza, as a first maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer.""I think the PARP space will be quite large,"" JMP's King said. ""It's hard to tell in the real world if doctors will see these drugs as better so they can start producing some satisfactory sales figures.""RELATED:Biotechs Sell Off In Droves — Are Investors Seeking Mergers?This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenThis Cancer Biotech Is Falling On Its $1.55 Billion Bayer Deal

113,CELG,"After a postelection year when the S&P 500 climbed 21.83%, the Dow Jones industrials surged 28.11% and the market's top stocks did far better, investors may have to search farther for big returns in 2018.
"
114,CELG,"X Since 1963, the S&P 500 delivered 19 years in which it rallied more than 15%. But each year following those big gains averaged a more modest 7.5% advance. That said, money managers and strategists still see plenty of investment opportunities in 2018.And some seem to already be at hand. Scarcely three days into the new year and the Dow has charged ahead 1.4%, in the process topping 25,000 for the first time ever.But some of the best gains for the full year may come in overseas stock markets and in value equities both in the U.S. and abroad. (Click here for a timeline and detailed chart of 2017's remarkable stock market.)That rotation of big portfolios into more foreign stocks is expected to take place despite economic uncertainty due to the U.K.'s Brexit and escalating tensions with Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping, not to mention North Korea's nuclear threats.Two big reasons are the prospect of faster economic growth abroad and cheaper valuations for many foreign equities. GDP growth will likely continue strong in both China and Europe, where European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi says monetary stimulus will continue until at least September.Special Report: 2018 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2017 Stock Market ReviewThe U.S. economy looks positive too. Investors are heartened by incoming Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and they're jazzed by a drum roll of moves by President Trump, including tax reform, opening the way for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, throttling back on federal regulations and withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.But with many stocks up sharply from a year ago, investment strategists and fund managers expect more modest stock price gains in 2018. The S&P 500's 2017 return was more than double the big-cap bogey's 8.50% average annual gain over the past 10 years. The Nasdaq composite index shot up 29.64% and the Dow Jones industrials gained 25.08%.Align Technology (ALGN), part of the Nasdaq and a member of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks, jumped 131% in 2017. The company is known for its computer-assisted design approach to straightening teeth.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), a key cog in the Dow, rose 24% in 2017. IBD Markets Editor Juan Carlos Arancibia analyzes 2017's top-performing stocks in a separate article.Against this backdrop, money pros say some of the best opportunities lie in non-U.S. stocks. And in both the U.S. and abroad, they see good potential in value-oriented stocks, including cyclical stocks whose performance swings up and down with economic conditions.""Stocks will be better than bonds once again in 2018,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for broker and financial advisor Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""And we like international markets better than domestic. That includes developed markets in the eurozone but not the U.K., and it includes Japan.""Joy cites three reasons why foreign stocks may shine. ""Economic growth relative to potential growth appears to be stronger in those international markets than in the U.S. even though the U.S. is doing well,"" he said. ""And central banks in those (foreign) geographies will be more accommodative than in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve as everyone knows is raising interest rates.""The third reason: Valuations. U.S. stocks as a group have grown expensive, Joy says. Other markets are more attractively valued. So there's more upside potential than in U.S. stocks overall.But Joy added, ""We do think U.S. stocks will go higher."" Ameriprise currently forecasts that the S&P 500 will hit 2865 in 2018, up 7% from its 2673.61 level at year-end 2017.Joseph Davis, Vanguard's global chief economist and head of its investment strategy group, says Vanguard expects the lowest returns for U.S. equities in roughly a decade. His group expects 4% to 6% annual gains for U.S. stocks in the next five years.Ameriprise forecasts 3.0% U.S. GDP growth in excess of inflation in 2018. Before Congress passed tax reform, Ameriprise was predicting 2.4%. China's pace should remain around 6.5%. The eurozone's economy should grow around 2.2% vs. 2.1% in 2017.As for interest rates Ameriprise, among others, expects the Fed to continue raising rates. That ""will be a lid on earnings multiples for U.S. corporations and may bring some (multiples) down,"" Joy said. Research firm Action Economics sees the fed funds rate around 2.12% by the end of 2018, up from its 1.25% to 1.50% band since June 2017.U.S. tax reform is a wild card. ""It should add incrementally to earnings growth and economic growth,"" Joy said. ""It should provide a little tailwind to stocks.""U.S. joblessness should drop to 3.6% by the end of 2018, the lowest rate since 1969, Ameriprise says. The unemployment rate was 4.1% in November 2017.David Polak, equity investment specialist at Capital Group, the parent of American Funds, sees investment opportunities in several geographic markets. Asia and the U.S. remain leading sites of technology innovators, he says.Manufacturers of logic chips are one group of innovators. Industry consolidation has left four key players, including Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and California-based Intel (INTC). Fifteen years ago, there were 25.""Taiwan Semi and Intel are dominant,"" Polak said. ""Consolidation has left the space more disciplined, which should lead to more visibility of earnings and more pricing power.""Another Asia stock he likes is Japan's Murata Manufacturing. ""Their ceramic capacitors are crucial components for smartphones, but relatively inexpensive, so manufacturers can stuff phones with them without impacting their margins much,"" he said.Since the capacitors are used in Apple iPhones as well as Samsung Galaxy and other Android phones, ""It's a way to invest in the growth element without having to bet on which phone will do better,"" Polak said.In gaming, he likes the way Japan's Nintendo (NTDOY) has diversified its addressable market. ""They took their intellectual property away from just hardware,"" Polak said. ""You used to have to play their games only on their hardware. Now it's available on multiple devices.""Then there's Tencent (TCEHY), China's leading provider of messaging and mobile gaming services. Tencent also owns the popular WeChat app.For Polak, a key Tencent trait is its leadership in China's mobile payments services, enabling consumers to use smartphones to pay bills and make online purchases.Peter Bourbeau, co-manager of $9.3 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLYX) sees opportunities among U.S. stocks but says it's time to switch from FAANG stocks because their price run-ups have left less room to rise. The ClearBridge fund is on track to becoming a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner after outperforming the S&P 500 in 2017 as well as in the trailing three, five and 10 years.Schlumberger (SLB) should benefit from a bottoming among energy stocks, Bourbeau says. Oil and gas service companies have regained pricing power, he adds.""SLB currently generates incremental margins of 60%-plus (the highest in its history) and is benefiting from its OneStim U.S. joint venture with Weatherford International (WFT) for pressure pumping,"" he said. ""SLB is the only global service company that is using its balance sheet to invest alongside its customers.""Among health care stocks, Bourbeau likes Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). He calls it ""a leader in ultrarare genetic disease treatments. The company recently cleared the decks with new management and a refocused research and development profile. Alexion also received additional approvals for its lead compound Soliris for (treating other maladies)."" Solaris also was being tested for new ways of being administered.Within the financial services stock group, he likes Visa (V). ""Visa is making very good progress on its recent acquisition of Visa Europe with synergies and client engagement,"" he said. ""Although incremental margins are extremely strong, Visa continues to innovate within its core debit/credit portfolio as well as (creating) new ways to integrate with merchants and cardholders.""What about some of the big stocks that padded his mutual fund's recent gains? FAANG stock Amazon (AMZN), up 56% in 2017, was among his top holdings as of Sept. 30. So was Microsoft (MSFT), which rose 38% for the year.""Amazon continues to execute its plan of disrupting adjacent verticals and margin-rich opportunities,"" Bourbeau said. ""It continues to focus on marketplace, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime. The company has a huge opportunity outside the U.S. and will focus on countries like India, which is more hospitable to Western technology companies. We still see a large opportunity in AWS as we are in early stages of a generational shift to how technology is created and consumed.""Regarding Microsoft, Bourbeau said, ""We expect more of the same strong growth trends for Microsoft as the software maker helps its clients move workloads to the cloud. Its Azure cloud business is at a $20 billion run rate (in sales for 2018) and growing double digits. The company continues to focus on partnerships with service providers and competing technology, a departure from the strategy of previous management.""Celgene (CELG), another top holding, is an inexpensive stock, he said, adding that Celgene has a strategy for coping with the patent expiration of its flagship product, the cancer drug Revlimid, in the middle of the next decade. ""The biotechnology company should have 19 late-stage clinical readouts in 2019,"" he said. ""Cash continues to build and we expect some business development opportunities or acquisitions to further bolster its clinical pipeline.""MORE IBD COVERAGE FOR YOU:2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow Tax Reform Impacts Your Tax Bracket And RateYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeAI In Business: This Is What The Future HoldsBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

115,CELG,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) popped Tuesday after it and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) were listed as top biotech stock picks for 2018 amid ""hyper-competition, pricing pressure and uncertain (merger) activity"" likely to dominate the year.X Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges pegs Vertex and Alexion as leaders in 2018 as their rivals struggle with mounting competition and rely on pricing hikes to sustain top-line growth. Both have strong management teams and attractive franchises that could garner takeover interest.""Our analysis leads us to believe that the best performing stocks in the foreseeable future will be those participating in categories with high barriers to entry, that rely on volume growth rather than positive price contribution,"" he said in a note to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Alexion climbed 3.7% to finish at 124.05. Vertex rose 2% to finish at 152.90. Vertex shares ended 2017 up 103% with Alexion down 2%. Meanwhile, the broader biotech group wrapped the year up 32%.Vertex was the second best performer of the top 10 biotechs by market cap, easily leading Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG) which ended the year up a respective 19%, flat and down 10%. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) led the top 10, rocketing 239%.Vertex has monopolized the cystic fibrosis category with drugs known as Kalydeco and Orkambi, Porges said. Its nearest competitor, Galapagos (GLPG), is at a time disadvantage and its products haven't shown the same effectiveness as Vertex's.""Despite the lucrative commercial opportunity that cystic fibrosis presents, the high barriers to entry in this therapeutic indication have precluded the emergence of a clear, viable threat to Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: The median tenure of chief executives at large-cap biotechs fell to just one year in 2017, plunging from 11 years in 2007. That could have an impact on mergers and acquisitions in 2018, an analyst said last week. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.In the first quarter, Vertex is likely to gain approval for a combination of drugs known as tezacaftor and ivacaftor to treat some cystic fibrosis patients. This should gain traction among patients who discontinued treatment with Orkambi due to tolerability.This year will also be key for Vertex's triple-pill regimen to treat cystic fibrosis, he said. Vertex is planning to begin pivotal trials in the first half of 2018. Most analysts expect a triple-pill to gain approval in 2019-'20.Alexion, meanwhile, has seen 20% revenue growth for a drug known as Soliris over the past two years as a treatment for a pair of blood disorders. This increase in sales was mostly due to volume increases with little price contribution, Porges said.In October, the Food and Drug Administration approved Soliris to treat a muscle disease, which should help continue the sales trend, he said. Alexion is also working on a follow-on drug known as ALXN1210 with a favorable dosing schedule and potentially better effectiveness.Porges expect ALXN1210 to prove superior to Soliris in treating a blood disease known as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in Phase 3 testing. That should result in high conversion rates to ALXN1210 from Soliris when it's likely approved in 2019.""This catalyst should also extend the terminal cash flow horizon for Alexion's key franchise from mid-2020s to the mid-2030s, when patents for ALXN1210 expire,"" he said.Further, Alexion said late Tuesday its board of directors agreed to work with activist investor Elliott Management to identify a new board member. In November, Alexion said it had a search underway to fill an open board seat and is looking for candidates from a range of backgrounds, skills and expertise.RELATED:Q&A: Vertex Chief Talks About Company's 'Transformational Year'Why Biotech Stocks May Wait A While Before Feeling The LoveWhy This Biotech Could See 30% Upside In The Second Quarter

116,CELG,"Biotech and pharma stocks dipped Monday after the Senate passed its version of the GOP tax reform bill that leaves the fate of a key research-and-development tax credit up in the air.X The R&D tax credit confusion is an unintended consequence of the 11th-hour re-addition of the corporate alternative minimum tax, a parallel system in which companies pay a low 20% rate but get fewer tax breaks.Under the Senate's plan, the R&D tax credit would no longer be available to some companies using the alternative minimum tax system, said Joe Panetta, chief executive of Biocom, an advocate for 1,000 research and life science firms.Panetta was unsure how many of Biocom's members use the alternative minimum tax system, though said a number of the biotech companies in the group aren't profitable and therefore can't claim the R&D tax credit.As the Dow Jones Index (DJI) closed up 0.2%, key biotech indexes went in reverse. The iShares Nasdaq Index (IBB) lost 1.6%, the SPDR S&P Biotech Index (XBI) dipped 2.4% and the ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (BIB) dove 3.2%.Meanwhile, IBD's 42-company Ethical Drugs industry group toppled a collective 1.3% and the 461-company biotech group broadly fell 2.2% on the stock market today.Still Panetta says Congress is still a long way from a final bill and he expects that side effect to be right-sided before the final draft goes to the president's desk. Congress is under pressure from the top to have this done by Christmas.IBD'S TAKE: Large-cap biotechs saw a number of drugs slow down in the third quarter, while smaller-caps benefits from sales that outpaced consensus views. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on the group's performance post earnings.But analysts and observers say it's not necessarily the R&D tax credit confusion alone that's causing some pain for the biotech sector. There's also the matter of what's called the orphan drug tax credit which incentivizes the development of treatments for especially rare diseases.In November, House Republications proposed eliminating the credit entirely. A Senate committee, though, proposed reducing the credit from its current 50%. Biocom's Panetta is hopeful the House and Senate can find some middle ground on the matter.""The orphan drug tax benefit is a boon to patients and biotech companies,"" he said. ""Senator (Orrin) Hatch has been really adamant about this and he carries a lot of weight.""Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young notes repatriation is at the forefront of investors' minds. If heavy-hitters like Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), which have billions in cash stored overseas, can bring some of that back to the U.S. at a lower tax rate, they might consider acquisitions.Mergers and acquisitions are what's missing from the biotech space, Young told Investor's Business Daily. Key products are slowing down and investors are looking for biotechs to deliver new strategies for growth.""A company like Amgen, for example, has $40 billion in cash overseas,"" she said. ""It seems like your strategy could potentially be a little bit different if you could bring some of that back to the United States to have a bigger opportunity for assets to acquire.""RELATED:Amazon Reportedly In Talks With Mylan, Novartis About Pharma EntryThis Biotech Launched To A Record High On Cancer Test ApprovalAmgen, Regeneron Prep For Battle In 2018 Over Cholesterol Drugs

117,CELG,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) caught an upgrade Thursday following its Kite Pharma buyout and the likelihood its new CAR-T cancer medications will allow it to diversify away from its maturing hepatitis C franchise.X Maxim Group analyst Jason McCarthy upgraded Gilead to a buy rating from hold. He has a 94 price target on the stock which, by the closing bell on the stock market today, advanced 1.5% to finish at 74.78.CAR-T drugs are made using a patient's own extracted immune system cells. They are reprogrammed to seek and destroy cancer cells before being reintroduced to the patient. Due to their nature, it can take weeks to manufacture these drugs.But a visit to a Kite manufacturing facility in China left McCarthy impressed. The entire process takes 16-18 days for Gilead/Kite's CAR-T drugs. Kite's facility in El Segundo, Calif., can handle 4,000 patient treatments per year.A program called Kite Konnect gives healthcare providers, patients and Gilead access to real-time tracking of the CAR-T process. Production is now semi-automated. Gilead has plans to automate production in the future to increase capacity and decrease costs.""We were impressed and left clear with the notion that Gilead (and Kite) can overcome manufacturing challenges to commercialize in the U.S. and globally, especially China, this new innovative therapy,"" he said in a note to clients.Now's the time to buy Gilead, McCarthy said. Investors get access to the recently-bought CAR-T drugs for free plus Gilead's hepatitis C franchise. Gilead's hepatitis C drugs set records for being among the strongest drug launches in history.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to cross the finish line with its CAR-T therapy, but others are on its tail. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on the growing CAR-T market and which competitors are set to turn that market on its head.In more recent years, though, the hepatitis C unit has struggled as the market matures amid high cure rates. Now, the market is entering its fourth year and comparisons are getting easier, McCarthy said.""What's important is not to lose sight of the fact that Gilead had $2.7 billion in free cash flow last quarter,"" he said.Buying into CAR-T helps diversify Gilead. Gilead finished acquiring Kite in October, just before the Food and Drug Administration approved Kite's drug known as Yescarta, for some adults with some large B-cell lymphomas. Approvals are also expected in Europe, China and Japan.McCarthy expects Gilead to generate more than $5 billion in the coming years with a global presence in late-stage B-cell cancer. Further, CAR-T therapies are now being integrated with other forms of cancer treatment.""Kite could be the first that keeps on giving,"" he said.But Gilead isn't alone with its CAR-T offering. Novartis (NVS) was first to gain approval with a drug called Kymriah, approved to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in some patients up to age 25.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are also partnered with Celgene (CELG) to develop their own CAR-T therapies.RELATED:Why Amgen Could Have An Edge Over These Rivals In Preventing MigrainesHow Celgene, Gilead's Pricing Woes Continue To Haunt Biotech StocksDow Stock Merck Topples After Withdrawing Keytruda Application In Europe

118,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) toppled to a four-month low Friday after it scrapped trials in Crohn's disease — a late-stage failure that ""throws some cold water"" on the biotech's efforts in treating inflammatory bowel disease.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Celgene plunged 10.8% to finish at 121.33. Shares hit a low last seen in mid-June.The decision to terminate a Phase 3 and an extension trial in Crohn's disease followed an interim analysis. Celgene also said it won't initiate another Phase 3 trial testing the drug, mongersen, in Crohn's. The fate of a trial in ulcerative colitis is up in the air.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says it's clear that mongersen failed to reproduce its earlier efficiency in this larger international trial. There were no safety imbalances in the interim analysis, Celgene said.Celgene acquired mongersen, also known as GED-0301, in a $710 million deal in 2014 with private Irish company Nogra Pharma. It later bought immune- and metabolic-biopharma player Receptos in 2015 to hedge its bets on mongersen, Porges said.Thursday's news ""throws some cold water on (Celgene's) inflammatory bowel disease and business development strategies,"" he said. But he suggested that investors take advantage of weakness in the stock.""As much as there is a temptation to question the value of other investments the company has made, we tend to view this as a one-off, particularly bad investment decision by the then-inexperienced inflammation and immunology team at Celgene in 2014,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: President Donald Trump could sign an executive order to curb drug prices ""any day,"" according to a Washington, D.C.-based expert. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what this would mean for biotechs and drugmakers.Still, the disappointment is likely to cost Celgene up to $2 billion in long-term revenue and up to 4%-5% in value, Porges said. He cut his price target on Celgene to 156 from 159, but kept his outperform rating, noting that prospects still look strong for ozanimod.Ozanimod, acquired with Receptos, is being studied to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. Celgene's strategy in inflammatory bowel disease has been largely reduced to ulcerative colitis, though ozanimod has some potential in Crohn's, Porges said.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams estimates that the opportunity for mongersen in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis could have been significant. He saw peak revenues of $2.4 billion for mongersen. The consensus had modeled peak revenue of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion with sales starting in 2019.But ""ozanimod's emergence suggests that Celgene should be able to capture the Crohn's disease market with that drug instead,"" Abrahams said. ""We do not believe there are significant consensus estimates for ozanimod in Crohn's disease at this point.""Expectations for mongersen were low, he wrote in a note to clients. The news leaves room for higher-probability catalysts including cancer drug Revlimid in lymphoma, ozanimod in Crohn's, ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis, and Otezla in ulcerative colitis.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young, too, remained bullish on the prospects for ozanimod.Mongersen ""was a very different mechanism and we have greater confidence on ozanimod's mechanism of action in inflammatory disease,"" she wrote in a note to clients. She kept her outperform rating on Celgene stock, but lowered her price target to 145 from 156.Abrahams and Young both noted that Celgene could look to buy something. Its flagship product, Revlimid, will lose patent protection over the next decade. Analysts are looking for Celgene to diversify beyond Revlimid, which accounted for more than 62% of sales in 2016.RELATED:Celgene Falls After Scrapping Crohn's Disease Drug TrialsDoes Gilead Now Have A New Multibillion-Dollar Franchise?Celgene Blood Cancer Treatment: Just The Tip Of Its Disruptive Science?

A third trial in Crohn's disease, a Phase 3 study called Define, will not be initiated. The trials involved the drug known as mongersen.""We thank the patients and the investigators involved in the Revolve trial,"" Chief Operating Officer Scott Smith said in a news release. ""While we are disappointed with the results of Revolve, we remain committed to advancing our portfolio of novel medicines for patients suffering from this disease and other inflammatory bowel disorders.""The decision came following a recommendation from the data monitoring committee, which assessed overall benefit and risk during a recent interim analysis, Celgene said. It noted there were no meaningful safety imbalances identified in the analysis.Celgene is waiting to review data from a Phase 2 trial of mongersen in ulcerative colitis to determine its next steps.Celgene shares fell 6% to 127.75 in late trading on the stock market today.

123,CELG,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) topped sales and adjusted profits views in the third quarter, but shares dropped late Thursday after its hepatitis C drug franchise declined again and narrowly missed consensus expectations.XIn after-hours trading on the stock market today, Gilead fell 4.1% to 74.70. Shares closed down 2.5%, at 77.88, as biotech stocks widely sold off before the closing bell Thursday following Celgene's (CELG) sales miss and guidance cut.Total sales of $6.51 billion declined 13.2% but topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $6.33 billion. Adjusted profit came in at $2.27 a share, down 17.5%, but beat expectations for adjusted earnings of $2.03 per share.Sales of HIV and hepatitis B drugs climbed nearly 3% to $3.6 billion. Flagship HIV drug Genvoya posted a yearly gain of 114% to $988 million and beat the consensus for $934 million, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note to clients.Gilead's hepatitis C drugs, meanwhile, continued to struggle, falling by a third to $2.2 billion and missing analyst views for $2.3 billion, Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar said in a note. This follows the entry of AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret which can treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C.RBC's Abrahams noted hepatitis C drug Harvoni came in ""considerably lighter than expectations"" at $973 million vs. the consensus at $1.1 billion. Epclusa also missed, posting $882 million, which was below the consensus for $958 million.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead currently has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 66 out of a best-possible 99. Earlier this month, its RS Rating rose as high as 73. Visit IBD Data Stories for more on what goes into rating a stock.""Even without explicit 2018 guidance, we believe this directionally should help bring down Street hepatitis C numbers for next year, a welcome reduction that would lessen an overhang on shares,"" Abrahams said.Other product sales — which includes drugs to treat high blood pressure in the lungs, angina and fungal infections — declined about 1% to $559 million.Gilead increased the low-end of its 2017 net product sales guidance to $24.5 billion to $25.5 billion. It sees non-hepatitis C drug sales comprising $16 billion to $16.5 billion. The firm also lowered the top-end of its hepatitis C guidance to reflect $8.5 billion to $9 billion in sales.RELATED:Biotechs Amgen, Sarepta, Vertex Top Third-Quarter ExpectationsBoston Scientific Dives As Abbott Rivalry Hits Pacemaker SalesCelgene Crashes On Sales Miss; Alexion, Bristol Results Mixed

124,CELG,"Biotech stocks toppled last week following disappointing third-quarter results from the likes of Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), an analyst said Monday, noting that ""competition and pricing concerns started taking a toll.""XThe arrival of new competition in the form of AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret forced Gilead's hepatitis C drug franchise to lose share in the third quarter. Meanwhile, Celgene notes that its Otezla — which treats psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis — is in an ""increasingly competitive market.""Gilead topped total sales views, but revenue from hepatitis C drugs declined by a third and narrowly missed analyst forecasts. Celgene's ""alarming"" results were driven by a major miss in sales of Otezla, leading total sales to lag and guidance cuts.Instinet analyst Christopher Marai says the competitive and pricing concerns took a hit on the broad biotech market. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index finished down 4.4%, though the Nasdaq and S&P 500 both wrapped the week at less than 1% higher.Meanwhile, IBD's 454-company Biotech industry group lost nearly 3% and slipped to third out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. Over the last two weeks it had been ranked first and then second.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene cut many elements of its 2020 guidance, including in inflammation and immunology drugs. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what Celgene's results could mean for the broader group.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and AveXis (AVXS) are more exposed to competitive concerns, Marai said in a note to clients. Alnylam is working on a drug called patisiran to treat a rare disease caused by the buildup of abnormal materials and will rival Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) and Prothena (PRTA).AveXis is working on therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. There, it rivals Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis, which sell Spinraza to treat the same condition. Marai lists Spinraza alongside Sarepta Therapeutics' (SRPT) Exondys 51 for Duchenne muscular dystrophy as ""fundamentally strong launches.""""We continue to look at strength in select names as an opportunity to take profits in biotech and reinvest in less macro-exposed names that are rich in potential (stock) catalysts over the next 12 months,"" he said. ""We could avoid priced-for-perfection names including Alnylam and AveXis.""Over the next year, Marai sees Prothena, Deciphera Pharmaceuticals (DCPH), Cellectis (CLLS) and MacroGenics (MGNX) as having a slew of potential catalysts.RELATED:Dow's Merck Plunges To 17-Month Low On Growing Keytruda WorriesGilead Beats Third-Quarter Sales, Earnings ViewsThree Biotech Firms Top Third-Quarter Views — But Only One Pops

125,CELG,"Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) released preliminary data early Wednesday in, respectively, sickle cell disease and aggressive lymphoma — sending their stocks skyward.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Bluebird initially surged more than 10%, but settled back for a gain of 2.8% to finish at 142.95. Juno popped 7.6% to end the regular trading day at 48.31, well above a 47.13 buy point out of a flat base that began forming in late September.The duo released preliminary data ahead of the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in December. Bluebird's stock movement came despite the fact the biotech reported third-quarter sales and adjusted losses per share that lagged Wall Street.Preliminary data show Bluebird was able to boost the number of gene-corrected bone marrow cells in patients with sickle cell disease using an updated version of its therapy called LentiGlobin. This means patients could produce healthier red blood cells.Bluebird said it also plans to present updated data from a study of its drug, called bb2121, in patients with advanced multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. Bluebird is working on the drug and its follow-up, bb21217, with Celgene (CELG).IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have largely offered a mixed quarter, though Celgene's third-quarter sales were called ""alarming."" Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which firms have reported thus far.Quarterly results, though, lagged the consensus. Bluebird reported adjusted losses of $1.73 per share on $7.71 billion in sales, vs. analysts' call for an adjusted loss of $1.64 a share and $9 million in sales.Juno, which is set to report its quarterly results after the close, released early data from a study of its drug, dubbed JCAR017, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a blood cancer.In the study, 80% of patients responded to a specific dose of JCAR017 and all signs of cancer disappeared in 73% of patients in the core group at three months. Across both doses in the core group, the best overall response rate was 84% and the best complete response rate was 61%.JCAR017 belongs to a class known as CAR-T drugs where Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — by virtue of its acquisition of Kite Pharma — already have drugs approved.Gilead's Yescarta is already approved to treat large B-cell lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma.Novartis' drug, Kymriah, is approved to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. On Tuesday, Novartis said it's aiming to have Kymriah approved to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.RELATED:How Celgene, Gilead's Pricing Woes Continue To Haunt Biotech StocksGilead Tops Sales, Profit Views But Misses On Hep C; Shares FallDow Stock Merck Topples After Withdrawing Keytruda Application In Europe

126,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) shares went into free fall Thursday after the biotech giant turned in third-quarter results that one analyst called ""alarming,"" with sales missing and forcing the biotech to cut its outlook for 2017 and many elements of its 2020 forecast.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Celgene had crashed by 16.4% to finish at 99.99, after hitting its lowest point since July 2016. Meanwhile, shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), which also offered mixed third-quarter results, fell 3.2% and 3.9%, respectively.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges characterized Celgene's third-quarter performance as ""alarming."" Revenue of $3.29 billion gained 10% year over year, but lagged the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $3.42 billion.""Recently installed new management are likely to face tough questions from investors about the company's direction and leadership after the operational and guidance disappointments this quarter,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Celgene's biggest pain came from Otezla, which treats psoriatic arthritis and moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Revenue from Otezla grew 12% from the year-earlier period to $308 million but that missed the consensus view by 26%, Porges said.In the U.S., Otezla brought in $250 million, missing by 28%. However, according to a health care tracker, Otezla prescriptions grew 3% quarter over quarter in the U.S., suggesting the surge in prescription volume in the second quarter forced a major price concession in the third quarter.The bright spot for Celgene was that its adjusted income of $1.91 per share grew 21% and beat expectations for $1.72 a share.IBD'S TAKE: A Washington, D.C.-based expert says President Donald Trump could sign an executive order to tug down on drug prices ""any day."" That could have a big hit on drug and biotech stocks. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown.Altogether, the results prompted Celgene to cut its 2017 sales guidance to $13 billion from earlier views for $13 billion to $13.4 billion. It now sees Otezla bringing in about $1.25 billion, down from its earlier forecast for $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Analysts had modeled $13.25 billion in total sales.Celgene also trimmed most elements of its 2020 guidance on Otezla's shortfall and after it terminated several trials of a drug dubbed mongersen to treat Crohn's disease. The fate of a midstage trial of mongersen in ulcerative colitis is up in the air.As a result, Celgene cut its 2020 guidance for inflammation and immunology drugs to $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, down from the forecast for more than $4 billion it issued in 2015. Hematology treatments are expected to account for $15.4 billion to $16.1 billion. Oncology drugs were guided to $1 billion to $1.1 billion.Total 2020 sales are now expected to come in at $19 billion to $20 billion, down from earlier views for north of $21 billion. Adjusted profit is now projected at more than $12.50 a share, vs. earlier expectations for more than $13 per share.""These guidance adjustments are likely to weigh on the stock near-term until more clarity from pipeline programs is established,"" Porges said. ""In essence, Celgene have loaded their midterm future to Revlimid, which the market increasingly anticipates will face generic competition in 2022.""Alexion wrapped its quarter with adjusted profit of $1.44 a share on revenue of $859 million, up 17% and 8%, respectively. Revenue missed the consensus for $867 million, though adjusted earnings beat analysts' average view for $1.13 a share.Sales of Soliris, a drug approved to treat two blood diseases and a chronic condition that causes muscle weakness, grew 4% year over year to $756 million, but that lagged most analyst views between $761 million and $769 million, RBC and Leerink analysts said.The firm boosted its 2017 sales guidance to $3.48 billion to $3.53 billion, from earlier expectations for $3.45 billion to $3.53 billion. Its guidance for Soliris rose slightly to $3.09 billion to $3.13 billion. Analysts had modeled total 2017 sales at $3.52 billion.Adjusted earnings are modeled at $5.50-$5.65 per share, up from Alexion's prior forecast for $5.40-$5.55 a share. The consensus was forecasting $4.74, on average.Alexion plunged 4.5% to close at 126.04 Thursday.Bristol posted adjusted income of 75 cents per share, down 2.6%, on $5.25 billion in sales, up 7%. Sales topped the consensus call for $5.195 billion, but adjusted profit missed the 77-cent per-share view. The bottom-line miss was on lower gross margin, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said.Key immuno-oncology drug Opdivo brought in $1.27 billion in global sales, growing 38% and topping analysts' views for $1.21 billion, Fernandez wrote in a note to clients. U.S. Opdivo sales of $778 million grew 9% and were above the consensus model for $732 million.Eliquis, an anticoagulant, posted a yearly sales gain of 39% to $1.23 billion worldwide. This was in line with the consensus but lagged Fernandez's expectation for $1.25 billion. Sales of immuno-oncology drug Yervoy came in at $323 million, but that missed the Street's view for $327 million.Bristol boosted its 2017 adjusted profit guidance to $2.95-$3.05 per share, up from $2.90-$3 a share.Shares lost 4.8% to close at 60.95.RELATED:Biotechs Amgen, Sarepta, Vertex Top Third-Quarter ExpectationsEdwards Lifesciences Crashes After Heart-Valve Sales Miss Lofty ViewsCould GlaxoSmithKline Scoop Up Pfizer's Over-The-Counter Unit?

Shares rose nearly 0.7% to 157.42, edging back above a prior flat-base buy point at 156.75.The megacap tech leader, which reports fiscal Q4 results late Monday, still holds a solid gain since it initially broke out of a first-stage bottoming base on Jan. 6-9, a cup-with-handle showing a 118.12 entry. Shares have rallied as much as 39% since then.The Street expects Q4 earnings to rise 12% to $1.87 a share, extending a streak of low double-digit EPS growth to a third quarter. After that, growth is expected to accelerate; fiscal year 2018 profit is expected to rise 24% to $11.15 a share.Apple's IBD ratings have improved since the start of the year.On Jan. 1, the iPhone and iPad giant showed a lousy Earnings Per Share Rating of 45 and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 59. Today, they've risen to 85 and 77, respectively, on a scale of 1 to 99.Apple's example in 2017 is a good lesson in how a stock chart can help an investor spot an excellent turnaround situation. Four quarters ago, the company posted a 15% drop in Q4 earnings per share and a 9% slump in revenue (its third straight year-over-year drop). With such results, and a lagging stock price, no wonder Apple's IBD ratings plunged into mediocrity.However, under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook, the company continues to create innovative and popular new products. The company also has set a goal of doubling its services-related revenue by decade's end.Sales have risen 3%, 5% and 7% in the past three quarters. The Street sees Q4 sales rising 8%, to $50.79 billion, continuing a slow-yet-steady acceleration in top-line growth.Fiscal year 2018, which ends in September next year, could be even better. Apple's revenue is seen increasing 17% to $266.6 billion, up from an expected 5% gain in the just-ended fiscal year 2017.Celgene reported a respectable 21% jump in Q3 profit to $1.91 a share, and that beat the consensus estimate by 2%. But perhaps Wall Street had been hoping for a bigger beat. Meanwhile, a 10% gain on the top line to $3.29 billion marked the weakest year-over-year increase in more than four years.Did Celgene give investors any sell signals before Thursday's tumble? In fact, yes.Back in June, the cancer treatment specialist bolted out of a somewhat lopsided cup base at 127.74, then rallied 15% to as high as 147.17. But a sharp gap down in heavy trading on Oct. 5 gave a strong hint at a change in the character of the action.Just days later on Oct. 13, Celgene then tripped below its 50-day moving average. Volume ballooned 40% above the 50-day average, a sign that institutions were locking in gains.IBD'S TAKE: In some cases, a great stock will punctuate the end of a rally with multiple sell signals, covered frequently in IBD's Investor's Corner and daily market columns. Check out this article on how to spot multiple sell signals to lock in profits and raise cash to maximize your portfolio return.Fortinet (FTNT) may be working on a  new handle on a double-bottom base. The security software firm is an industry peer of Palo Alto Networks (PANW), currently a member of Leaderboard, IBD's premium stockpicking and chart annotating service.Fortinet, slated to report Q3 results after the close today, has moved past a 39.61 buy point within a 13-week double-bottom base. In this base, the second low of 35.44 undercut the first low of 35.87. Fortinet broke out on Oct. 18 in heavy volume and remains in buy range.The buy zone goes up to 41.59.Meanwhile, since Fortinet has not yet climbed to new highs, the possibility of an alternate buy point exists.Notice on the daily chart how the stock has pulled back mildly over the past several sessions. A good handle features such action, running lower along the lows as the stock trades lightly. In a proper handle, the decline usually never exceeds more than 12%. However, a handle must also be a minimum five trading days long; Fortinet has pulled back just four sessions.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the midcap stock sports a good Composite Rating of 94 on a scale of 1 to 99. Despite a mediocre RS Rating, the up/down volume ratio of 1.4 points to heavy-volume buying by institutions over the past 50 sessions.Other top-rated stocks in IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group include Nice (NICE) (96 Composite, but thinly trade), Symantec (SYMC) (79 Composite, but also posting a big turnaround in 2017), and Qualys (QLYS) (94 Composite, testing support near the 50-day moving average following an Aug. 3 breakout past a flat base at 44.45).Elsewhere in the stock market, certain consumer-spending plays thrived.Group 1 Automotive (GPI) broke out past a 75.52 buy point in a long cup with handle as shares rose 10% to 77.82. Volume is running more than four times its 50-day average. The buy zone goes up to 79.30.Earnings rose 14% to $2.23 a share, snapping a two-quarter streak of falling profits. Revenue rose 7% to $3.01 billion, matching the biggest increase in seven quarters.On the downside, Raytheon (RTN) undercut its 50-day moving average in heavy volume since late June as shares in the missile maker dropped more than 4% to 180.59. The stock has rallied as much as 32% since clearing a flat-base pattern at 143.49 on Nov. 9 last year.Raytheon reported a 7% increase in Q3 earnings to $1.97 a share, beating views. But it's also the third quarter of single-digit EPS growth in the past four quarters. Revenue rose 4% to $6.28 billion.A continued dive beneath the 50-day line would trigger a key IBD sell signal.Raytheon faced such a challenge soon after the Nov. 9 breakout last year. The stock spiked through its 50-day moving average on both Dec. 12 and on Jan. 26 this year, but immediately rebounded.RELATED:Know The Cup With Handle; What Makes This Chart Pattern Special?This Psychological Market Indicator Just Made A Mini-SpikeWhat Is The I In CAN SLIM?How To Find Excellent Stocks Like Nvidia: Begin Your Search Here

136,CELG,"Loxo Oncology's (LOXO) deal with Bayer (BAYRY) had a bigger impact on the biotech sector than you'd expect, an industry observer told Investor's Business Daily on Tuesday as key exchange traded funds fell out of flat bases.XEarly Tuesday, Loxo announced a deal with Bayer to co-develop two of its cancer drugs in an agreement that could pay Loxo up to $1.55 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Loxo and Bayer will split profits equally on drugs known as larotrectinib and LOXO-195 in the U.S.But the sector was hoping for an outright buyout, said Brad Loncar, portfolio manager for Loncar Investments, in an interview with IBD. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR) toppled alongside its fellow ETF peers, falling 3.4% to 23.30.""(Loxo) has been one of, if not the, most successful small biotech companies this year,"" he said. ""Some people were hoping for an outright buyout, and even if they weren't hoping for a buyout they gave pretty clear guidance they were going to hold on to those rights.""Loxo stock was up 159% for the year as of Monday's close, easily outperforming IBD's 458-company biotech industry group, which has climbed 25% year to date. On the stock market today, Loxo toppled 4.1% to close at 79.84, though shares were down as much as 12.8% earlier in the day.Collectively, the biotech group dove 2.6% and neared a three-month low after hitting its highest point since December 2015 in October. But the third-quarter earnings season was rough for a number of players like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), which weighed heavily on the group.Biotech-centric ETFs also took pitfalls. The S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) fell out of its flat base with a buy point at 89.08, diving 2%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) had been forming a flat base with an entry at 342.60, but fell 1.6%. ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (BIB) dove 3.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Loxo has an IBD Composite Rating of 51 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated players in the biotech group.Loncar says mergers and acquisitions could really help the biotech group.""If (Loxo) had been bought out today, everybody would be saying, 'What's the next smaller company that's going to be bought out?' and they would probably be bidding up all of the stocks,"" he said.The fact Loxo was willing to give away 50% of its profits on these two drugs, both of which work to target gene fusions in cancer, suggests the biotech's negotiating was a bit weaker than expected, Loncar said. This ""revaluation"" is hurting the sector.He puts Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) into the same bucket. Both have approved drugs, known as PARP inhibitors, that target ovarian cancer. Loxo's larotrectinib isn't yet approved.Big pharmas, which struggled in the quarter, need to buy revenue growth, Loncar says. But it's possible ""the market (has) pushed their valuations so high that an outright buyout doesn't make sense"" for the likes of Loxo, Tesaro and Clovis, he added.The biotech industry group is now ranked No. 19 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, down from first just a month ago. Gilead's acquisition of Kite Pharma — announced in August and completed in October — helped spike the group to a nearly two-year high.Since then, the group has pulled back. Investors either reacted harshly or surprisingly to news out of the group, Loncar said. Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX) dove nearly 41% on Nov. 7 after unveiling the abstracts for its immuno-oncology combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) for pancreatic cancer.Overall, 13% of patients responded to the combination of Five Prime's cabiralizumab and Bristol's Opdivo. Pancreatic cancer is particularly hard to treat. Typically, doctors would have expected no response from the combination. Now, the duo has time to refine its treatment regimen.""We Wall Street people demand instant gratification and instant success out of drugs,"" Loncar said. ""It would be disappointing if this was a big Phase 3 trial at the end of the road. But this is literally the first in-human trial.""Dynavax Technologies (DVAX) also has suffered following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of its drug dubbed Heplisav-B to treat hepatitis B. The stock fell 9.4% on Monday. Loncar says investors are looking for Dynavax to either be bought or find a partner.""I think they probably will find a deal like that,"" he said. ""But you can't expect it literally the day after the approval. So between now and the first quarter when they're actually launching the drug, I think there's a chance for some good news there.""He added: ""A lot of investors expected a big pop, and as soon as there wasn't they ran for the exits. I don't think that's reflective of the quality of the company.""RELATED:This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenWhy Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To ToppleThis Biotech Just Rose By A Third On Its Earnings — But Is It In Trouble?
"
137,CELG,"Celgene (CELG), a pioneer and leading player in blood cancer treatment, has become a biotech juggernaut thanks largely to a drug that proved key in fighting the tricky disease multiple myeloma.XIn multiple myeloma, cancerous plasma cells in bone marrow elude immune-system fighters with a one-two punch: By changing the way they look and act while producing immune-suppressing molecules. Enter Celgene's Revlimid.This so-called immune-modulating drug helps immune cells attack cancer cells and starve myeloma cells in bone marrow by preventing new blood vessels from forming. The drug might also become a big weapon against an equally dreaded disease, lymphoma.Drugs battling diseases such as lupus, multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis also are on Celgene's potential hit list — an arsenal that earned the company recognition by Investor's Business Daily in the inaugural IBD Innovator Awards for biotech.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers, and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Revlimid will continue to dominate the company's revenue for now. Though multiple myeloma remains an incurable cancer, Revlimid has proved to extend survival rates.""That drug is going to do around $9 billion in sales next year, which makes it one of the biggest drugs in all of biotech,"" said analyst Michael Yee, managing director at investment house Jefferies. He has a buy rating on Celgene, with a price target of 160.Celgene estimates that its sales, led by Revlimid, could exceed more than $21 billion by 2020, up nearly 40% from its expected revenue this year of roughly $13 billion. Celgene notched sales of $11.2 billion last year.The company's stock soared from about 40 in 2013, the year Revlimid won FDA approval to treat relapsed mantle-cell lymphoma, to a then-record 140 in mid-2015, the year Revlimid gained approval for patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. That high held until early September, and in early October Celgene stock touched a record high near 147.Early this year, the FDA approved Revlimid as a maintenance treatment for a subset of patients with multiple myeloma, those needing maintenance after a stem-cell transplant.With a market cap near $107 billion, Celgene ranks No. 2 among the 453 companies in IBD's biotech industry group, trailing only Amgen (AMGN).Celgene's growth started with its 1992 licensing of a controversial drug with a bad reputation: thalidomide, which two decades earlier had been linked to birth defects.In 1999, thalidomide was approved as an anti-infective to treat lesions in patients with leprosy. Scientists also started to look at the drug as a possible therapy for multiple myeloma.Meanwhile, Celgene's scientists worked to improve the efficacy and side effects of thalidomide for treating multiple myeloma.The result: Thalidomide was approved for patients with newly diagnosed myeloma in 2006, followed shortly by the approval of lenalidomide — an orally administered thalidomide analogue — under the trade name Revlimid, for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who received at least one prior therapy.IBD'S TAKE: The biggest companies can still produce big stock gains, but often without the volatility of smaller stocks. The IBD Big Cap 20, which has recently included Celgene, is the place to track the biggest recent movers among the big boys.Revlimid was first approved in late 2005 for a subset of patients with the rare blood cancer known as MDS.Celgene didn't stop innovating. Many of its drug candidates are small-molecule compounds also meant to modulate the immune system. These drugs target the sources of the disease rather than the symptoms.""They aren't just doing me-too drugs,"" Yee said.Celgene's executives like to say the company favors ""disruptive science.""As CEO Mark Alles explained to IBD: ""Celgene's core purpose is to apply unique scientific insights into the underlying source and mechanism of disease to provide new treatments for patients with significant medical needs.""Celgene spends nearly $3 billion annually in research and development. Drugs in its pipeline especially target blood cancers, solid tumors, and inflammatory and immune diseases.Its research portfolio includes 50 molecules supported by 100 different clinical programs, Alles pointed out at an investor conference this spring. Of those 50, 14 could be approved before 2021, with nine or 10 having multibillion-dollar blockbuster potential, he says.Alles also told IBD that Celgene partners with ""other promising innovators to enhance and accelerate the discovery of new medicines.""Many of its more than 30 partnerships are with small biotechs, including Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Acceleron Pharma (XLRN).In July, Celgene said it would collaborate with China-based BeiGene (BGNE) to develop and market an investigational protein inhibitor for patients with solid-tumor cancers.""Their business model is driven by internal R&D as well as 'distributed' research,"" Yee said, ""whereby they seek to license and acquire complementary products that are focused on novel mechanisms of action that try to treat the underlying cause of the disease.""Analysts say one of the most notable drugs in Celgene's internally developed war chest is the fast-growing Otezla, an autoimmune treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It is one of the company's four current blockbusters — drugs with annual sales of $1 billion-plus.Besides leader Revlimid, the other blockbusters are: Pomalyst, a second-generation version of Revlimid approved in 2013 for patients who didn't respond to other therapies; and Abraxane, used to treat breast cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.Celgene is also studying Otezla for potential use in ulcerative colitis and Behcet's disease.Among other new indications, Celgene hopes that Revlimid will prove effective in treating Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Lymphoma is of ""equal or greater size"" than myeloma, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent research report.Following Celgene's better-than-expected second-quarter results, Porges raised his price target to 160 from 150. He rates the stock outperform, citing ""a number of pivotal trial results emerging this year and next.""New drugs are crucial. Celgene loses patent protection on Revlimid in 2027. Not a worry, says analyst Yee: ""They are finding new blockbuster drugs that will diversify the revenue base.""One potential blockbuster is ozanimod, which came by way of Celgene's $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos in 2015. The oral drug showed positive results in late-stage trials for relapsed multiple sclerosis.Celgene estimates that ozanimod could generate $2 billion to $3 billion in annual sales for treating MS and an equal amount for treating ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease could provide further revenue if clinical trials prove positive.Based on emerging data, ozanimod also has the potential to serve as ""an anchor for our neuro franchise in the future,"" Celgene President Scott Smith told analysts in the company's Q2 earnings call.Another closely watched potential blockbuster in late-stage trials is the oral compound GED-0301, for treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The development drug was licensed from privately held Nogra Pharma in 2014.A small-molecule drug known as AG-221, or Idhifa, which was licensed from Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), is the first approved product from Celgene's collaborations.In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved AG-221 for a subset of adult patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. Most patients with AML eventually relapse and, of those, up to an estimated 20% have a mutation that AG-221 targets.Analyst Leah Cann of Oppenheimer estimates that drug, which she expects will hit the market in the fourth quarter, could garner $1.4 billion in annual sales in 2021.Meanwhile, the compound CC-220 is showing ""encouraging clinical data in lupus,"" Alles told analysts in July, noting that the autoimmune disease has a ""large and dramatically underserved patient population. … (W)e have some pretty exciting initial data.""And positive late-stage results for new indications in several immunology/oncology combination trials could breathe new life into one of Celgene's top-four drugs, Abraxane.Sales have been growing slowly of late, up just 2% in the second quarter, to $254 million. In contrast, Otezla's Q2 sales jumped 49% to $358 million.Celgene boasts many other drugs at early stages. One potential blockbuster, for example, could treat the aggressive cancerous brain tumor glioblastoma, recently diagnosed in Sen. John McCain. Celgene expects to start a pivotal trial this year with proteasome inhibitor marizomib, in combination with standard therapy.Celgene bought marizomib last year from privately held Triphase Accelerator.Whether internally developed or by way of partners, Celgene's therapies, said analyst Yee, ""are some of the most novel and innovative in biotech.""RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkCelgene Is Among Big Cap 20's Solid PerformersHow Celgene's Immuno-Oncology Effort Helped This Small Biotech StockA Look At A Recent Celgene Stock Breakout

156,CELG,"Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAAP) launched to a record high Thursday on rumors Swiss drug giant Novartis (NVS) could attempt to take it over — a potential deal one analyst called ""very logical.""XAdvanced Accelerator gapped up as much as 12.7% to an all-time high of 67.37, before settling back to 65.10 for a gain of 8.9% at the close. Novartis lifted a fraction, to finish at 84.75.The potential deal would fit well with Novartis' existing franchise including Sandostatin, approved to treat symptoms associated with some tumors, and Afinitor, approved to treat some cancers affecting the breast, kidneys, hormones and nervous system, Canaccord analyst Mark Massaro said.Advanced Accelerator is working to gain approval for a drug called Lutathera to treat some tumors in the gastrointestinal tract. In December, Lutathera was delayed at the Food and Drug Administration. Approval in the U.S. is now expected in January.""We expect final European Medicines Agency approval for Lutathera within the coming days, and FDA approval (scheduled for) Jan. 26, 2018, both of which should push shares higher,"" Massaro wrote in a note to clients. An expanded access program should help the U.S. launch.IBD'S TAKE: Cellular therapy, also known as CAR-T therapy, is getting some legs on Wall Street after Novartis gained the first approval earlier this year. Kite Pharma could be next. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at how these medicines are made.Massaro expects Lutathera to offer a ""long tail"" for revenue considering the limited supply of materials that go into it and the drug's extreme efficiency. He models $407 million in peak U.S. sales by 2024 and $133 million in peak European sales by 2023.""But we model conservative pricing in line with current therapies despite Lutathera's significant efficacy advantage,"" he said. Massaro kept his buy rating and 60 price target on Advanced Accelerator.For Novartis, gaining access to Lutathera would be ""very logical,"" he said. Cancer drugs are a staple in Novartis' pipeline. Advanced Accelerator also has drugs to treat neuroendocrine, prostate, breast and gastrointestinal cancers in its pipeline.Novartis just gained approval of a drug called Kymriah, a cellular therapy to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. But competition is coming. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is working to acquire Kite Pharma (KITE), which is closing in on approval of a similar drug.Behind Gilead/Kite, Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are each working with Celgene (CELG) to develop similar cellular therapies to treat blood cancers.RELATED:Biotechs Beating The Market, But Are They In Buy Range?Galapagos Pops After Eczema Drug Shows Promise Vs.

162,CELG,"The potential cancer-cure disclosures that propelled Loxo Oncology (LOXO) stock up 43% one day in June and an additional 15% one day in September indicate innovation in cancer research and treatment that many investors say could keep Loxo aloft.XWith a potential near-blockbuster cancer treatment in the making, Loxo is recognized by Investor's Business Daily in the inaugural IBD Biotech Innovators Awards. Its lead drug looks medically promising, but it targets a relatively small patient population, so annual revenue is expected to fall short of the $1 billion that defines a commercial blockbuster.But it could get close. Loxo stock made that big leap on June 5 after the company disclosed progress in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for its lead drug candidate, larotrectinib. The Sept. 13 leap for Loxo stock followed word it would disclose Phase 1 trial data for its tumor fighter at the annual meeting of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, set to start Saturday, Oct. 15. Loxo stock touched its all-time high of 95.92 on Sept. 28.The company expects to file a New Drug Application for  larotrectinib by early 2018. If the Food and Drug Administration approves the NDA within six months, as Loxo expects, the company could begin sales to specific patients almost immediately.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers, and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Loxo's focus on developing highly selective ""precision medicine"" for patients with genetically defined cancers is gaining ground with researchers, patients and doctors — and fund managers.Rather than looking to attack a specific cancer, say by using compounds that kill lung tumors (and sometimes either don't work or kill healthy cells too), Loxo uses increasingly popular gene sequencing to identify patients hosting a specific gene mutation resulting in a tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion. These are abnormal proteins that tell tumor cells to grow. Using Loxo's novel compound that inhibits TRK fusion activity — called TRK inhibitors or kinase inhibitors – Loxo's clinical trial therapy demonstrated improvements in patients with 17 different types of cancer.Hence, Loxo's larotrectinib is gaining attention in research clinics and on Wall Street. It could well become the first drug initially approved by the FDA to target mutant proteins in many cancers rather than targeting a cancer itself.Loxo spokesman Dan Budwick calls this approach ""tumor agnostic,"" and notes that Merck's (MRK) Keytruda was indeed approved in May for treatment of any unresectable metastatic solid tumor with specific genetic qualities, a first from the FDA.But Keytruda was initially approved, in 2014, for metastatic melanoma, then for non-small-cell lung cancer in 2015, then head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 2016, and was already in widespread use when Merck applied to the FDA to also use Keytruda in a gene-sequencing tumor-agnostic approach rather than the old tumor-specific approach. In contrast, Loxo's larotrectinib would be the first time the FDA initially approved a cancer drug using the tumor-agnostic gene-sequencing approach.IBD'S TAKE: Loxo recently hit an all-time high, but what companies are doing so at the moment? IBD's New Highs list tracks these movers, but also ranks them by IBD Composite Rating.Loxo's potential has Wall Street's attention. The number of mutual funds holding Loxo shares jumped 27% in Q2, supporting a market cap near $2.7 billion and a secondary offering in late June. It marked eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Loxo of late sports a highest-possible IBD Relative Strength Rating of 99, putting it among the top 1% of stocks in price performance over the past 12 months.Some two weeks after Loxo's June 3-5 reports at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, the world's biggest cancer conference, Loxo sold more than 3.6 million shares of common stock in a secondary offering, pricing shares at 72, although the stock had traded well below 20 as recently as November. The company raised $260.8 million before expenses.The stock performance of Loxo rivals or would-be rivals, however, has been spotty at times, though most are on a roll of late.Loxo's peer Ignyta (RXDX) — which went public in early 2014, five months before Loxo — has mostly traded below its IPO price of 10, though on Thursday Ignyta stock touched a 22-month high of 14.70.Loxo partner Array Biopharma (ARRY) peaked near 16 shortly after its 2000 IPO, but the stock is way up since touching a six-year low below 2.50 in February 2016, this month hitting an eight-month high of 12.68.Blueprint Medicines (BPMC), which like Loxo develops kinase inhibitors, went public at 18 in 2015 and on Sept. 29 hit a new all-time high of 71.67 after a 50% September run-up.At ASCO in June, Loxo reported a 76% objective response rate — tumor sizes were reduced in 76% of patients — across many cancer types in clinical trials with patients whose tumors hold TRK fusions.""Larotrectinib delivers consistent and durable responses in TRK fusion patients across all ages, regardless of tumor context, and does so with few side effects,"" Dr. David Hyman, the research team's principal investigator in Loxo's larotrectinib trials, told the ASCO conference. Hyman is chief of early drug development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""In this way, the larotrectinib/TRK-fusion story fulfills the promise of precision medicine, where tumor genetics rather than tumor site-of-origin define the treatment approach.""Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt says Loxo estimates 1,500 to 5,000 U.S. patients annually could benefit from larotrectinib treatment. In the trial data disclosed to ASCO, patients with the greatest tumor shrinkage — at or near 100% — included those with soft-tissue sarcoma, lung and colon cancers, melanoma and salivary-gland cancer. In all, 17 types of cancer are being treated in three trials with 55 patients who have at least one thing in common: those gene mutations causing kinase or TRK fusions that tell the cancer cells to grow.Larotrectinib earned Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA in July 2016, meaning the FDA gives it some priority because early trials suggest the new therapy offers a serious advantage over existing treatments for people with life-threatening diseases. (Breakthrough is not necessarily the FDA's highest priority, however. Fast Track and Priority Review designations and an Accelerated Approval Pathway are the FDA's urgent alternatives.)Larotrectinib, then called Loxo 101, received the Breakthrough designation for ""unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with (neuronal) TRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed (worsened) following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments,"" noted the Friends of Cancer Research. The nonprofit counted 47 FDA Breakthrough designations in 2016, of which 17, including larotrectinib, targeted cancer.Analyst Schmidt says the recent efficacy data for larotrectinib are among ""the best ever that we have seen in oncology."" He estimates a peak larotrectinib market of $500 million in annual sales in five to 10 years. Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison sees larotrectinib peaking at $800 million in annual sales around 2025.Loxo, which went public in August 2014 at 13 per share, conceivably could get acquired at a blockbuster-like premium, though no buyout talk has surfaced. Among biotechs that end up being purchased, most are acquired before becoming profitable, says Schmidt. Cowen estimates Loxo won't escape the red ink until after 2020.""One thing that has transpired since (ASCO in June) is Celgene's (CELG) pricing on Idhifa at $25,000 per month, a new high for the niche oncology market,"" Schmidt told IBD.  ""This will give Loxo some breathing room and perhaps lead them to consider a higher price for larotrectinib.""Idhifa was approved by the FDA on Aug. 1 to treat AML, the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. Celgene estimates some 21,000 new AML cases are diagnosed in the U.S. annually.June's secondary offering, which more than doubled Loxo's cash pile to nearly $470 million as of June 30, helped Loxo make a $40 million acquisition of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors program from Redx Pharma. It renamed the Redx drug candidate Loxo-305.In Loxo's acquisition release, its chief business officer, Jacob Van Naarden, called the deal ""another program to our pipeline that so nicely aligns with our larger strategic vision and capabilities. The Redx team has created a novel chemical matter that selectively and reversibly inhibits BTK, a validated molecular target across numerous B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.""Analyst Schmidt told IBD the $40 million price tag ""looked right to me. The BTK target is validated, and there is unmet need in patients who fail Imbruvica,"" AbbVie's (ABBV) and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) commercial name for ibrutinib, which treats complications from stem-cell or bone-marrow transplants known as chronic graft versus host disease, or GVHD.In his research note, Morgan Stanley's Harrison praised the BTK acquisition, calling it ""a logical addition to the Loxo pipeline."" He rated Loxo stock as overweight, with a 91 price target. Cowen's Schmidt rates Loxo outperform but doesn't offer a price target.The Cowen analyst was unfazed by Loxo's Q2 financials, with losses greater than estimated. ""Cash-burning biotech earnings rarely are interesting,"" Schmidt said. Loxo reported a wider loss of $30.4 million, or $1.14 a share, up from $15.9 million, or 77 cents, in Q2 2016. Loxo is slated to post Q3 results on Oct. 31.With its cash hoard, Loxo is in no danger of running out of money for years, but  investors expect sales and profit before then.Cowen's Schmidt, who's met at least twice recently with Loxo's top brass, says the company is ""on track"" toward speedy approval for larotrectinib.Loxo is working on other potential drugs, including the BTK inhibitors bought from RedX to target leukemia and lymphoma, and a pipeline with partner Array Biopharma for six kinase inhibitor targets. But it's too early to suggest that any will approach blockbuster status.RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkHere's Why Loxo Oncology Stock Hit A Record HighWhy This Small-Cap Biotech Stock Popped To A New High

163,CELG,"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 82 to 98 Thursday. X This proprietary rating tracks technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that indicates how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks matches up against all other stocks in our database. History shows that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains typically have an RS Rating north of 80 at the beginning of a new climb.Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereAlnylam Pharmaceuticals has moved more than 5% past an 87.02 entry in a second-stage flat base, meaning it's now out of a proper buy zone. Look for the stock to create a new buying opportunity like a three-weeks tight or pullback to the 50-day or 10-week line. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals reported -22% earnings growth last quarter. Sales gains came in at 83%. The company holds the No. 119 rank among its peers in the Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group.

164,CELG,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose Friday morning after the Senate approved a budget resolution late Thursday, paving the way for up to $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years.XS&P 500 futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value, while Dow futures climbed 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.25%.It's unclear how much tax cuts are already priced into the stock market, which has rallied significantly since President Trump's election in large part on hopes for lower corporate tax rates and other reforms.Also, Trump and GOP lawmakers may have unrealistic expectations about the size of the tax cuts given the budget constraints. But the budget blueprint, passed by a 51-49 vote, is still a key step. It allows Republicans to push for deficit-financed tax cuts of up to $1.5 trillion without Democratic support, but they can afford only two defections.Before the budget vote, highly rated Celgene (CELG), PayPal (PYPL) and Atlassian (TEAM) were active in late trading on earnings and other news.Meanwhile in Thursday stock market trading, the S&P 500 index and Dow erased losses to close slightly higher, but the Nasdaq retreated as FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) drifted below recent breakout entry points.PayPal, Celgene, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Atlassian all have Composite Ratings of 95 or better. The Composite Rating, which runs from 1 to 99, combines several proprietary IBD ratings into one number. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big runs.Facebook fell 0.8% to 174.56, closing off intraday lows for 172.64 but still ending below a 175.59 buy point cleared on Tuesday. Thursday's slide wasn't that impressive, but neither was the breakout, though Tuesday's upside move came on above-average volume.Alphabet dipped 1.1% to 1,001,84 on Thursday, below its 1,006.31 entry topped on Oct. 13. Again, the Google parent's retreat was rather modest, though it did come on volume that was 11% above trend.The problem with lackluster breakouts, which have been all too common in recent months, is that they suggest a lack of institutional support. And by creeping just over buy points and not advancing, stocks such as Facebook and Google are vulnerable to going underwater on modest market, industry or company-specific news.Then again, any piece of good news or market momentum could push these stocks back into buy zones.Facebook rose 0.4% to 175.22 in premarket trading Friday, while Alphabet was up 0.3% to 1,005.11.PayPal, 98 Composite Rating: PayPal reported a 31% earnings per share gain, with revenue up 21% to $3.24 billion, both better than expected. The online payments processor gave Q4 EPS and revenue guidance basically in line with analyst views. PayPal rose 3.9% in early trading. PayPal closed down 1 cent to 67.25 on Thursday, but was up 70% so far in 2017.Celgene, 99 Composite Rating: Celgene announced that it is discounting two trials for a Crohn's disease drug and will not start a third. It said mongersen (GED-301) failed an interim futility analysis. Celgene had spent $710 million in 2014 to obtain mongersen. Shares of the biotech giant tumbled 6.1% early Friday. Celgene undercut a 139.10 buy point about two weeks ago and last Friday fell below its 50-day moving average.Atlassian, 98 Composite Rating: Atlassian earned 12 cents a share in its fiscal Q1, up 20%, with revenue up 42% to $194 million, both topping the consensus. The maker of project-management and collaborative software raised guidance. Atlassian was not yet active Friday morning, but jumped 12.5% in after-hours trading. During Thursday's regular session, the stock dipped to 39.06 intraday, below a recent 39.35 buy point, but rallied to close up 1.1% at 40.25.RELATED:The Big Picture: Bears Lose Their Grip, Stocks Continue To Break OutCelgene Falls After Scrapping Crohn's Disease Drug TrialsPayPal Earnings, Revenue Top Expectations, Shares RiseAtlassian Revenue, Profit Blow Past Estimates, Shares JumpFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

168,CELG,"Kite Pharma is edging closer to approval for a cutting-edge cancer treatment that fights the disease by rebuilding a patient's own cells — a technology that could benefit thousands of people and pave the way for blockbuster drugs.XKite's ultracustomized treatment is a key entry in an area of great promise in cancer research and has attracted about a dozen drugmakers, including Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Celgene (CELG) and Novartis (NVS). The latter got a major FDA approval in August, giving Novartis the lead in this emerging field.Those firms and others are developing their own cancer-fighting systems that harness the same underlying process used by Kite, which is now a unit of Gilead Sciences (GILD). The approach, called CAR-T therapy, uses bioengineering to retrain a patient's infection-fighting white blood cells to seek out and destroy cancer cells.Analysts say Kite's manufacturing process stands out in the CAR-T field for its shorter turnaround time to treatment and success rate.For Kite's groundbreaking work, Investor's Business Daily named the company an IBD Biotech Innovator in the inaugural edition of the awards.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer, told IBD that current cell therapies are ""just the beginning … . This is an area that's really set up to undergo big changes over the next few years.And Kite has recently enlisted a powerful ally.In late August, Gilead of Foster City, Calif., agreed to acquire Santa Monica, Calif.-based Kite for $180 a share in an all-cash deal valued at $11.9 billion. The deal closed Oct. 3. Kite already was trading at all-time highs, near 140, since the start of summer, after going public at $17 a share in mid-2014. Gilead stock rose above 86 from about 75 after the companies announced their merger, but closed Friday at 81.17.The alliance brings Kite an established partner with financial heft and industry breadth just as the biotech ingenue prepares to beef up production and distribution of its flagship drug.That treatment — axi-cel, short for axicabtagene ciloleucel — is designed to fight an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer affecting the immune system that is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S. Kite is expected to get drug approval this year.Gilead is hitching its star to Kite with expectations of gaining a string of successful cancer-fighting products at a time when Gilead's strongest portfolio of medications, for treating hepatitis C, is losing steam.Kite expects the manufacturing process it honed to develop axi-cel will serve as the foundation for future treatments, including those to destroy solid cancer tumors and cancers of the cervix, head and neck.Pharmaceutical companies typically look to fill out their product pipelines by acquiring companies with a technology they don't have. That's where Gilead's purchase of Kite comes in.""It wasn't just a 'one and done' kind of an acquisition. … It was more of a long-term play with multiple product opportunities, and we could see this playing out for decades to come,"" Gilead CEO John Milligan said on a conference call with analysts following the purchase announcement.Even with sales of its hepatitis C products crimped, revenue is growing from Gilead's HIV/AIDS drugs. The company is expected to end the year with revenue of $24 billion to $25.5 billion, down from $30.4 billion last year.Gilead is the No. 3 company by market cap among the 453 companies in IBD's biotechnology industry group, trailing leader Amgen (AMGN) and just behind Celgene.Gilead has ""a substantial balance sheet where they could help fund the launch (of Kite products) in Europe, help expand Kite's manufacturing capacity beyond its facility in El Segundo (Calif.) and help propel other early-stage projects forward,"" Jefferies analyst Biren Amin told IBD.In return, Amin said, Gilead gets ""an early- to midstage oncology pipeline, which they didn't have. Kite allows them to diversify away from hepatitis C longer term.""Kite isn't saying how much it will charge for its treatment until the product is approved, but Amin said analysts estimate costs will range from $250,000 to $300,000 for one person's full course of the therapy. The company has built the capacity to produce between 4,000 and 5,000 patient therapies a year, Kite spokeswoman Christine Cassiano said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision on Kite's axi-cel drug by Nov. 29. Kite hasn't disclosed a brand name for the drug.If that timeline holds, Kite's drug could reach blockbuster status — annual sales of $1 billion or more — in 2020, according to Amin.Kite won't be the first biotech company to receive FDA approval for a CAR-T drug. Novartis got the green light from the FDA on Aug. 30 for its therapy for certain types of leukemia in children and young adults.If Kite's axi-cel drug is approved by the FDA, it will become the first therapy of its kind to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with advanced cases of the disease. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that originates in the immune system.The therapy involves extracting and filtering a patient's blood to remove key components of the immune system called T cells, and engineering those cells in the lab so they express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that is programmed to escort intruder-destroying T cells directly to proteins found on the surface of cancer cells. These modified T cells are infused back into the patient, where they multiply and become the body's cancer fighters.Researchers affiliated with the National Institutes of Health developed the early science that underpins the process and, in 2012, licensed it to Kite. Kite is one of about a dozen biotech firms that have received permission to use the agency's version of the technology, according to Amin.Kite's study found that about eight months after a single infusion of their treatment was administered, 39% of patients with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma for whom chemotherapy no longer worked were in complete remission, with no sign of malignancy.""There's no rocket science there,"" said Kite's Chang about the company's multistep manufacturing process, which he said takes 17 days ""vein to vein."" That, he says, is the shortest turnaround time among companies trying to develop their own versions of a CAR-T drug.There is an art to the manufacturing process, and observers say Kite's deft approach and high success rate in its clinical trials has set the company apart.""One thing we paid a lot of attention to was making sure that every manufacturing was as successful so that there is a cell product to be given back to the patient,"" Chang said. ""We were able to treat everybody who enrolled in our clinical study, with the exception of a single patient. That's one out of 111 patients — or less than 1% — who was not able to be treated.""Kite aims to automate more of the drug development process as part of a collaboration with General Electric (GE) offshoot GE Global Research. The initiative could help Kite reduce manufacturing costs, speed up processing time and minimize variability in the results. Kite also is researching ways to change how the cells are manipulated with growth factors to make the supercharged cells more effective once they are returned to the patient, Chang said.The company is investigating how to equip a person's cells so they are able to ""go after"" more than just one type of cancer, he said. Kite is even looking to develop an ""off the shelf"" CAR-T product that could be used by any patient, he says.""When we talk about innovation, it's about execution as well as making the right choices, hopefully, to guide on your programs,"" said analyst Amin. ""They're doing that.""RELATED:Besides Kite Pharma, Which Companies Rose To IBD Biotech Innovators Status?Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkBluebird Is Among The Biotech Stocks Near New HighsWhy Biotech Stocks Had A Catch-Up RallyWill Novartis Acquire This Company?

174,CELG,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) jumped early Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration approved what is known as a CAR-T drug, dubbed Yescarta, to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.XThe late Wednesday approval follows two weeks after Gilead closed its acquisition of Kite Pharma, which developed the drug, and after Novartis' (NVS) CAR-T drug was approved in late August, making it the first of its class to win approval.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead climbed 2% to close at 81.59. Shares are currently forming a flat base with an 86.36 entry.CAR-T drugs are made using a patient's own immune cells. The cells are extracted, reprogrammed to fight cancer and are then reintroduced to the patient's body. Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are also working on CAR-T drugs in partnerships with Celgene (CELG).Gilead's drug is approved to treat adult patients with what's known as large B-cell lymphoma after two or more previous treatments. This includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, accounting for three out of five cases, Gilead says.IBD'S TAKE: A Washington, D.C.-based expert expects President Donald Trump to sign an executive order to bring down drug prices ""any day."" That could make things harder for biotechs and drugmakers. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown.There are an estimated 7,500 patients with hard-to-treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma eligible for CAR-T therapy, Gilead says. The FDA estimates that of 72,000 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed each year, roughly 25,000 are new cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Yescarta is ""a new option for patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma who have run out of treatment options and face a dire prognosis,"" said Louis DeGennaro, chief executive of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, in a statement.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says Gilead is at the beginning of what could be a ""potential multibillion-dollar franchise."" The approval came a month ahead of expectations, demonstrating the high unmet need in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, he said in a note to clients.Gilead is pricing Yescarta at $373,000, which is below the $475,000 price tag for Novartis' drug, Kymriah. Kymriah was approved in late August to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges, though, notes that Novartis is taking an outcome-based approach to pricing with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in which the firm will only be paid for patients who respond within one month of treatment with Kymriah.""Based on the 83% response rate in their pivotal trial, we estimate the real list price to be less than $394,000 per treatment, placing Yescarta at a less than 5% discount to Novartis' drug on a net price basis,"" he wrote in a note to clients.RBC's Abrahams estimates that Gilead will pull in $90 million in 2018 on a gradual launch. He expects Yescarta sales to grow to at least $1 billion by 2026 solely as a third treatment in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. But CAR-T drugs are being investigated to treat a myriad of blood cancers.""If we increase pricing and assumed approval in all indications (second treatment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, pediatric and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia), in our current model, we could see $2.7 billion in peak revenue potential,"" he said.Leerink's Porges is less bullish on Gilead. Yescarta's list price is higher than he expected, but Gilead's core business is still facing competitive challenges and patent expiries. He kept his market perform rating on the stock.Getting the most out of its Kite acquisition will require expanding Yescarta's use, Porges said.""The announcement does not provide the justification for the premium Gilead paid for Kite's cellular therapy platform,"" he said. ""Gilead is depending on broadening to earlier lines of treatment, expanding to other indications and development of additional products to generate an adequate return on the acquisition.""The label for Yescarta warns of cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities. The former is associated with flulike symptoms including fever. Cytokine release syndrome was seen in 94% of patients in clinical trials, with more-severe cases in 13% of patients.In comparison, the label for Novartis' Kymriah notes that the more-severe cytokine release syndrome occurred in 49% of patients, Porges said.Due to the potential for cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities, Yescarta is available only through a restricted program called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. This means facilities administering the drug must be certified and abide by specific rules for administration.The program requires that two doses of an immunosuppressive drug be available prior to Yescarta infusion. Patients must be monitored at a facility for a week following treatment for signs of cytokine release syndrome. Follow-up monitoring is required for four weeks after infusion.Ultimately, Gilead plans to have 70 to 90 U.S. medical centers capable of administering Yescarta. The drug has a median turnaround time of 17 days and a 99% manufacturing-success rate from a facility in El Segundo, Calif, Gilead said.RELATED:6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New AwardsHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealAnalysts Mixed On Gilead-Kite, But One Key Rival Stands To Benefit

176,CELG,"Cure is a strong word when it comes to treating cancer and other deadly diseases, but Brad Loncar is among the biotech stock analysts and investors ready to employ the term.X""For the first time, biotech companies are not thinking about these technologies incrementally,"" said Loncar, portfolio manager of a biotech-focused ETF. ""They're not thinking about alleviating the symptoms of the disease, they're thinking about fixing the genetic mutations that cause the disease.""Loncar was speaking of cancer, but those comments could apply to other terrible diseases that claim thousands of lives, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Lou Gehrig's disease, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy.Thirty-five years after the first FDA-approved biotech drug, the biotech industry is rolling out innovations at a breakneck pace. The new-drug pipeline is bursting with treatments in clinical trials, the industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and many biotech stocks are scoring superior returns for investors.To recognize the biotechnology industry's contributions to science and to patients' health, Investor's Business Daily has created the IBD Biotech Innovator Awards. In this inaugural edition, we name six award-winning U.S. biotech companies, chosen for their groundbreaking treatments recently introduced to the market or well along in the new-product pipeline.The six companies are Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Kite Pharma, Incyte (INCY) and Loxo Oncology (LOXO). The winners aren't ranked in any way; only companies with U.S.-traded shares were considered.All but Biogen have their sights firmly on curing cancer, among other intractable diseases. Biogen is targeting the likes of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and MS.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)The six companies are just a few of the players in a huge field closely tracked by investors. IBD counts 453 publicly traded companies in its biotech industry group, which doesn't include the many other companies with biotech operations that aren't their main focus. The 453 have a combined market cap of nearly $900 billion and sales for the most recent 12 months of more than $100 billion.Thanks to the biotech industry, the pipeline of new drugs of all kinds has exploded. Clinicaltrials.org counts more than 1,480 drugs filed for Phase 3, or late-stage, trials with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year, and the FDA has more than 32,000 late-stage studies registered.IBD's biotech industry stock group has climbed 33% this year, shucking off the pains of the politically charged election season in 2016 and concerns that President Trump will work to lower drug prices. The group on Wednesday hit a 22-month high of 3,128 but is down from its all-time high near 3,900 in July 2015. It currently ranks No. 1 of the 197 groups tracked by IBD in terms of performance in the past six months.Boosting the group's performance are Celgene and Loxo, which recently hit new highs. Incyte touched a record high this year, while Biogen touched a 27-month high on Friday and Regeneron this year touched a nearly two-year high.The biotech-focused fund that Brad Loncar heads up is Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR), which tracks 30 biotechs working in immunotherapy. The exchange traded fund is nearing its two-year anniversary and is up 26% this year. His comments to IBD came amid a series of regulatory approvals and acquisitions in cancer treatment, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) foray into cellular therapy with its August agreement to acquire Kite for nearly $12 billion. (The Kite purchase was completed Oct. 3 and Kite now operates as a wholly owned Gilead unit.)Count Loncar among the bullish. Today, drugs can teach the immune system to identify, fight and precisely target cancerous cells. Technology can turn off or edit genes to correct genetic conditions.Some trial data are ""jaw-dropping,"" he said. One example is CAR-T technology, in which Kite is among the leaders. The field is young, but biotech companies ""are taking patients who have weeks or months to live and, in some cases, are seeing complete remissions,"" Loncar said. ""I've never seen anything like that.""Loncar likens chemotherapy to a bomb — it kills the enemy and everything else in sight. Loxo is using smart bombs. Its precision medicine targets gene fusions in cancer, JMP Securities analyst Mike King explains.In cancer, some genes are called passengers and others drivers, King told IBD. When a driver becomes fused to a normal cell, that normal cell transforms into a cancerous one. Loxo identifies and targets those fusions.At the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in June, Loxo showed the impact of its work with a photo of a sarcoma protruding from a child's chest, King says. By targeting what's called the TRK fusion, Loxo was able to treat the cancer.The tumor ""shrunk away to nothing without surgery or radiation or any other therapy contributing to it,"" he said. ""It was remarkable. It was pretty staggering even for people in the audience who are kind of used to seeing these kind of things.""Among 50 patients, the drug dubbed larotrectinib was able to partly shrink tumors in 64% of them, with all signs of cancer disappearing in 12% of patients. The drug has breakthrough, rare pediatric disease and orphan drug designations with the FDA.Also grabbing headlines is immuno-oncology work from Dow component Merck (MRK) as well as Incyte, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY) and AstraZeneca (AZN). Besides Kite, CAR-T therapy is getting its due from the likes of Novartis (NVS), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).Immuno-oncology and CAR-T are both methods of teaching the immune system to fight cancer. Immuno-oncology drugs do so by blocking specific interactions that would otherwise prevent an immune response. CAR-T drugs individualize that process by reprogramming a patient's own extracted immune cells.IBD'S TAKE: CAR-T drugs are snagging major attention after Gilead announced its plan to acquire Kite and Novartis got a major drug approval, opening up the sector for commercialization. Head to the IBD's Industry Snapshot feature for a closer look at the emerging CAR-T sector.Results have impressed, and immuno-oncology drugmakers are taking it a step further by combining their compounds in the hopes of seeing more robust responses. Merck has had success with its drug Keytruda, which has won approval as a first treatment with chemo in lung cancer.Incyte drug epacadostat is particularly intriguing, analysts say. It prevents some interactions involving the IDO enzyme. Merck and Bristol are pairing their drugs Keytruda and Opdivo — both belong to a class of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors — with Incyte's epacadostat.Regeneron, too, is working on a PD-1 inhibitor, with its REGN2810. It's developing this in partnership with Sanofi (SNY). In June, Regeneron and Sanofi said 46.2% of patients with a form of skin cancer responded to treatment with REGN2810 in a Phase 1 trial.On the CAR-T side, Novartis gained FDA approval in late August for a drug to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Its approval helped spike Gilead, which just two days before had announced its deal to acquire Kite.Kite is nearing approval for a CAR-T drug to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Juno is just behind with its drug called JCAR017, which would treat the same cancer as Kite's drug. Bluebird is working on a multiple myeloma drug.Juno and Bluebird both have partnered with Celgene on their programs. JMP's King calls it a ""best-in-breed"" approach, where Celgene will put its money on the line for potential innovation.Such partnerships are where Celgene excels, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten told IBD.  ""They've had these innovative deals across sectors, from small molecules to cell therapy,"" he said. ""They're innovative, and they cast the net widely for new technologies and potential therapies.""Others are reaping the benefits of a decades-old project that mapped the human genome. The first human genome map cost $2.7 billion in 1997 dollars and took almost 15 years to complete. Today, it costs closer to $1,000 to map an individual's entire genetic makeup.Gene therapies and editing are having a ""renaissance,"" JMP's King said. Analysts point to Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP), which made its IPO a year ago, as a leader in this field.Crispr is also the name of the technology. Crispr Therapeutics, Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD) and Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) also are making waves in the sector. The technology makes it much easier to edit genes, Needham analyst Alan Carr told IBD.BTIG analyst Dane Leone sees some of those companies entering the clinic in 2018.""This technology uses an enzyme that is actually from a bacterial organism to target areas of the genome or your DNA, where you want to make changes to the DNA,"" he said. ""What you can do using this enzyme complex is give it direction in terms of target, and insert it into a cell.""In the end, the enzyme complex attaches to DNA, where it can make alterations, he told IBD.JMP analyst King described Crispr technology as having the ability to ""repair broken genes, cut out and replace defective genes and insert functional genes where they're desired.""On the other side of the gene spectrum, RNA interference and antisense are responsible for cutting-edge drugs from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and Biogen partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Biogen and Ionis in December won FDA approval for Spinraza, the first drug of its type approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy.Needham's Carr likened RNA interference as a way of ""turning off"" a gene. This has the potential to be more robust than gene therapy, which must alter all or most of the cells in the body to be effective.In September, Alnylam stock spiked 52% in one day after its drug, patisiran, proved effective in treating a rare disease known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The disease results in the buildup of abnormal protein causing systemic problems. Patisiran uses RNA interference. Analysts call the late-stage data from Alnylam a ""big win"" for the concept.Bluebird is working in gene therapy to treat blood disorders.The list of innovations goes on and on in this era of biotech, but today's gains have been decades in the making.""It's usually a steady build and then you have these waves of innovation that kind of collide or emerge at similar points in time,"" JMP's King said. ""It's not like the traditional tech, where things can happen overnight.""RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Award-Winning Biotech Innovators And Their WorkGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy PointHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealThe Cure For Cancer?

On the other hand, AstraZeneca popped 5.1% to 31.89 and Celgene rose 1.1% to 141.76. Broadly, biotechs lifted a fraction.Early Thursday, Alnylam said it temporarily suspended testing of a hemophilia drug called fitusiran pending a review after a patient died. The patient was enrolled in a Phase 2 trial with hemophilia type A and died after forming a blood clot.Alnylam aims to resume tests after reviewing the safety of fitusiran and developing a risk mitigation strategy.The firm also said it reached an agreement with regulators regarding the Phase 3 trial design for its drug known as givosiran, a potential treatment for disorders involving the buildup of chemicals that produce porphyria in the body.Pending review of the program at the interim analysis — and assuming positive results — Alnylam said it expects to file an application for givosiran with the Food and Drug Administration near the end of 2018.The FDA placed five trials involving drugs from Celgene and AstraZeneca's immuno-oncology drug, Imfinzi, on partial clinical hold and put one on full clinical hold, citing issues with similar combos using a rival drug from Dow component Merck (MRK).AstraZeneca's Imfinzi and Merck's Keytruda belong to a class of drugs known as checkpoint inhibitors, which work to block a specific interaction in the immune system that would otherwise prevent an immune response. Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo is in the same class.IBD'S TAKE: Alnylam is still expected to provide data in a rare-disease trial and could be part of a stock rally in September, analysts say. Head to IBD Industry Themes to see why September could be a ""make or break"" month for the sector.Celgene's drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst are known as immuno-modulary agents, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. In July, three trials combining Merck's Keytruda with Revlimid or Pomalyst in multiple myeloma were placed on clinical holds following patient deaths.The FDA cited issues in combinations of Merck's and Celgene's drugs as its rationale for placing a trial of AstraZeneca's Imfinzi and Celgene's Revlimid on full clinical hold as well. All patients in the trial will discontinue treatment, Celgene said in a news release.""This suggests that the checkpoint and immuno-modulary agent combination is either associated with an increased rate of fatal and nonfatal serious adverse events, or that the combination somehow diminishes the efficacy of immuno-modulary agents given individually, or that the toxicity of the combination so reduced drug exposure as to undermine any potential clinical benefit,"" Porges said.Patients enrolled in trials placed on partial clinical holds can continue treatment if an investigator determines they are receiving a clinical benefit. No new patients will be enrolled in any of the six trials.Trials placed on partial clinical hold include several others in multiple myeloma, chromic lymphocytic leukemia and an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Celgene will continue to enroll patients in trials for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.RELATED:Top Biotech Stock Near Buy Zone After FDA Drug ApprovalFour Reasons To Keep Betting On The Biotech Stock RallyHow Bristol-Myers' Cancer Win Helped Boost This Rival

198,CELG,"What's the case in favor of actively managed stock mutual funds? Funds like $41 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) are Exhibit A. Run by Larry Puglia since its inception in mid-1993, the fund's 24.13% gain this year going into Thursday topped 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.XThat blistering pace was achieved with a portfolio that, as of June 30, included Electronic Arts (EA), Netflix (NFLX), Celgene (CELG) and Mastercard (MA).Except for an occasional lag like last year when the fund trailed its peers 0.98% to 3.23% while the S&P 500 rallied 11.96%, outperforming is the norm for Puglia. His fund outlegged 97% of its peers over the past five years. And it has averaged a 10.7% yearly return in the nearly quarter century Puglia has been at the helm, outpacing 90% of its peers, all of which averaged 8.07%.Blue Chip Growth wins over the long term with a strategy that fund literature distills to a few key points: ""The fund primarily invests in the common stocks of large and medium-sized blue chip companies that have the potential for above-average earnings growth and are well established in their respective industries.""The ""blue chip"" part of its name does not mean it focuses on stodgy stocks, if you judge by the results. Instead, Puglia looks for companies that have carved out leading market positions, that are led by seasoned management teams, that stand on solid financial foundations and that have above-average earnings growth and profitability.Since growth stocks historically have been more volatile than cyclical companies and slower-growth companies, Puglia aims for sector diversification to dampen those ups and downs.Technology was his largest sector, with 39% of his shareholders' money allocated there as of July 31.

200,CELG,"AbbVie's (ABBV) newly launched hepatitis C drug Mavyret has already grabbed 7% of total new prescriptions, further chipping away at Gilead Sciences' (GILD) struggling hepatitis C franchise, an analyst said Friday.XAs a result, Wall Street sees Gilead's 2018 hepatitis C drug sales declining 28% vs. the year-earlier period, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. The drop will be sharper in the U.S. at a 31% plunge. In 2019, sales are expected to fall another 19%.On a wholesale basis, Mavyret is priced at roughly half its competitors at $13,200 per month vs. $24,920, $28,000 and $31,500 for Gilead's Epclusa, Sovaldi and Harvoni, respectively. Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Zepatier and AbbVie's Viekira Pak cost a respective $18,200 and $27,773 monthly.But Gilead contends that after discounts and rebates, Mavyret is priced similarly to Harvoni. They differ, though, in treatment duration. Of the wide array of hepatitis C drugs, Mavyret can treat every genotype and has the shortest treatment duration at eight weeks for most patients.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to the finish line with a CAR-T drug. What does it mean for Gilead's plan to acquire Kite? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a deeper dive on the segment.To contend with the likelihood of further erosion in its hepatitis C franchise, Gilead is pivoting into cellular therapy with the $11.9 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma (KITE). Though Kite doesn't have an approved drug, the merger was announced days before a rival drug from Novartis (NVS) gained approval.Novartis' drug is approved to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Analysts now expect a similar drug from Kite, a treatment for an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, to grab approval later this year.Behind them, Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) are each partnered with Celgene (CELG) to work on similar treatments, known as CAR-T therapies.

215,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) and AbbVie (ABBV) are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of the inflammatory bowel disease market which is expanding at a rapid 20% clip, an analyst said Wednesday.XThe biologics market for these gastrointestinal diseases generated $9.2 billion in sales in 2016, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. AbbVie's Humira and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade, both anti-TNF drugs used to fight inflammation, dominate the market today.""We believe this market is likely to continue or exceed its recent 20% growth rate, with significant share and value likely to accrue to Celgene and some offsetting value available also for AbbVie despite the inevitable erosion of AbbVie's dominant Humira franchise,"" he said.New classes of inflammatory bowel disease drugs are arising. That's where the likes of Celgene, Roche (RHHBY), Galapagos (GPLG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie are looking to make their marks with drugs now in Phase 3 trials for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis — common forms of the disease.But earlier trials, without the benefit of clinical data to back them up, are having some difficulty in recruiting patients, Porges said. Many of these trials also exclude sicker patients, including the patients who've stopped responding to their current treatments.IBD'S TAKE: Earlier this year, AbbVie said it expects Humira to hit peak international sales in 2018 before facing erosion. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown on where AbbVie sees its biggest drug going and how it plans to offset competition.Though anti-TNFs like Humira and Remicade were the ""first truly disease-modifying treatment approaches,"" many patients don't respond to or stop responding to anti-TNF drugs, Porges said. Studies suggest 50%-60% of anti-TNF patients don't respond or lose response within a year.Estimates show there are up to 1.6 million patients in the U.S. with inflammatory bowel disease. Of those, about 640,000 have Crohn's disease and another 680,000 have ulcerative colitis. Patient numbers in Europe are about 60%-70% higher than in the U.S.This ""provides a large opportunity for drugs based on new mechanisms,"" he wrote.RELATED:Perrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendCould This Small Biotech Break Out On A Tie-Up With Eli Lilly?AbbVie Topples As Humira Sales Brake For Third Straight Quarter

230,CELG,"Amid a grinding-higher market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Biogen (BIIB), Electronic Arts (EA), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are highly rated big-cap stocks holding in buy zones after breaking out several days or weeks ago.XIdeally, stocks will blast out of bases and then rapidly add to gains, and there are some breakouts like that. But in the current market environment many stocks just edge past entry points, with shares soon pulling back below them, at least temporarily. Apple chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) both fell back below entry areas on Monday after breaking out Friday. While their breakouts aren't failures, their high-volume retreats aren't encouraging.Apple broke out of a flat base with a 156.75 buy point on Aug. 2, the day after reporting strong earnings and guidance. The iPhone giant did dip below that entry point a few times over the next few weeks, but since Aug. 21 the stock has stayed in a buy zone.Apple has trended lower since unveiling its new iPhones, with the high-end iPhone X not set for release until Nov. 2. Shares fell 0.8% to 158.67 in Monday stock market trading. One report said that iPhone 8 preorders appear so-so, perhaps as buyers hold off for the X model.Apple's 50-day moving average could offer further support as that key line has risen to about the entry level.Microsoft has been grinding higher in 2017, modestly outpacing the S&P 500 index. Microsoft has been breaking out, then pulling back below the entry area before finally moving higher, sometimes after forming a new consolidation.Microsoft cleared a base-on-base formation with a 74.52 entry back on Aug. 31. True to form, Microsoft pulled back the following day and didn't hold above the entry until Sept. 11. Shares hit a record-high 75.97 intraday Monday, but reversed to close down 0.2% at 75.16.Biogen soared 4.2% on Aug. 30, blowing past a 312.50 buy point from a 13-month consolidation. Shares continued to advance, becoming slightly extended at times but only closing above the 5% chase zone on Sept. 12. Since then, Biogen has retreated for the past four sessions, sliding nearly 1% on Monday to 318.18, still comfortably in a buy zone.Celgene just edged past a 139.10 buy point on Sept. 1, though that capped a huge 7.5% weekly gain as Celgene rallied on investor optimism for drugmakers with ties to CAR-T immuno-oncology treatments. Aside from an intraday drop on the next session, Sept. 5, Celgene has basically held in a buy range, slowly trending higher. Celgene rose 0.6% to 142.84 on Monday, setting a record 143.40 intraday.The video game publisher cleared a 116.14 buy point on July 26, just before the Nasdaq hit a short-term high. Electronics Arts tested that entry point several times, closing below it on Aug. 10-11. But since then EA has generally stayed within the 5% buy zone. Shares edged up 0.45% to 119.96 on Monday.EA's 50-day line has risen to just above the entry level, offering a possible backstop for the stock.Alexion, the last of three biotechs highlighted here, sold off from July 2015 to May 2017. But since then the stock has rebounded. On Sept. 1, shares cleared a 142.57 first-stage-base buy point. A week later, Alexion closed just below that entry, but hasn't done that since.Alexion will cut 20% of staff, the biotech said last week, to spend more on research.Alexion fell 2.1% to 143.64 on Monday.The casino giant rose strongly past a 139.77 flat-base buy point on Sept. 1. Since then shares have stayed in the buy zone, aside from flirting with becoming extended. Wynn Resorts rose 0.4% to 143.84 on Monday. Fellow Macau-centric casinos Melco Resorts (MLCO) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) have formed cup bases, with Melco just carving out a handle on Monday.Just because these seven stocks have generally held in a buy zone doesn't mean they'll stay that way. Some may begin to move sharply higher while others falter.

An expanded access program in North America, South America and Europe could open the doors to bigger sales, he said.New Chief Executive Douglas Ingram called Sarepta ""among the most undervalued and underappreciated companies for the pipeline and opportunity,"" Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote in a note to clients.This ""may likely reintroduce some (merger) premium to Sarepta shares,"" he said. He also upped his price target on Sarepta stock to 60 from 52, and reiterated his outperform rating.Like RBC's Eckler, Schwartz sees Sarepta's guidance as ""more modest than realistic."" Assuming the key growth drivers continue to evolve in Sarepta's favor, Schwartz sees another beat-and-raise in the company's future.""Management admitted to setting a more conservative guidance until the growth trajectory comes more predictable, so investors will likely be drawn to the robust growth story behind Sarepta,"" he wrote in a note to clients.A more realistic outcome for Sarepta's 2017 sales is around the lines of $109 million to $127 million, Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a research report. He expects Sarepta to achieve profitability as early as the second quarter of 2018.Messer kept his buy rating and 75 price target on Sarepta stock.RELATED:Sarepta Rockets On Consensus-Crushing Sales, Narrowing LossesHow These Biotechs Are Dodging Payor Pushback In Muscular Dystrophy'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings Consensus

262,CELG,"Life was simple for Rachel Martin in 1991. By day, she worked at an accounting firm on her way to becoming a CPA, and by night she ran -- until she started to notice her feet felt strangely stiff.XThat led to three bits of news one day soon after. Two were good, yet the odds still stacked up against her. ""That day I got notice of the multiple sclerosis, I got notice we sold our condo and I got notice of receiving my CPA license,"" she told Investor's Business Daily.The numbers haven't gone Martin's way ever since. She was 27 when diagnosed, half a lifetime ago. She hasn't worked for 23 years and has spent zero hours of her life working as a CPA. She's taken at least four medications to treat her MS, and exactly none have fully contained the ailment.A barrage of new drugs are taking aim at MS, however, offering hope for Martin and others with the debilitating illness. The medications are offering the lower costs you might expect when a market heats up, but they offer prospects for fewer side effects and, most critically, greater effectiveness.Several heavy hitters in the industry are getting involved in this biopharma battle. Roche (RHHBY) has a new drug that could swipe share from market leader Biogen (BIIB). Meanwhile, Celgene (CELG) and a number of generic-drug manufacturers are expected to pile the pressure on another mainstay in the field, Novartis (NVS).Roche shares were down fractionally Monday to close at 32.15 while Biogen ticked up 0.6% to finish at 234.70. Celgene was up marginally to 137.84 while Novartis was down slightly to 84.29.The MS sector has been dominated by Biogen, which brought in just shy of $9 billion in sales during 2016 with six medications in its arsenal. Included in its inventory is one MS drug that Martin recently stopped using, Avonex, as well as two other top sellers, Tysabri and Tecfidera.Now there's ""a paradigm shift,"" especially where Roche's MS drug, Ocrevus, is concerned, according to Michael DiFiore, analyst for Evercore. Ocrevus was approved earlier this year as a treatment for both relapsing-remitting and primary-progressive forms of MS. Offering medication for primary progressive is a breakthrough, since that form of MS comprises just 10% of the market and has not been targeted by treatments in the past.Ocrevus' twice-a-year infusion looks attractive for patients like Martin, who discontinued using certain drugs due to MS-related tremors. Martin's first medication was an interferon in 1994. She was on the medicine for 22 months until the shaking in her hands became so severe that she couldn't administer the injection.Analysts say Roche's drug puts Biogen's Tysabri and Tecfidera at the greatest risk of market share loss. Some Wall Street estimates see Ocrevus taking away 40%-50% of Tysabri sales and 30%-40% of Tecfidera revenue over three to four years.""With Ocrevus on the market, you have the threat of share being stolen,"" DiFiore told IBD. ""You also have the possibility of looking at generic versions of (Novartis') Gilenya and (Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA)) Copaxone. So there's a lot of moving parts.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 438-company Biotech industry group is now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked as shares have risen 23% for the year, riding high on a June rally that could still see another 15% upside, according to some estimates. Who could benefit in that spike? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.In Novartis' case, Celgene is heaping pressure on the company with a potential blockbuster MS drug that now has the test-phase name of ozanimod. Celgene, the No. 2 biotech in market cap is billing ozanimod as a safer version of Gilenya and is targeting the latter half of 2017 to file an application for approval with the Food and Drug Administration.Both ozanimod and Gilenya belong to the class of drugs called S1P receptor modulators. They work by preventing specific white blood cells from moving into the central nervous system. Doing so has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce MS relapses.MS is a disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body. Patients fatigue easily and have difficulty walking.""I went from running to walking, to the walker, and then to a wheelchair,"" said Martin. It wasn't muscular ability, she adds, it was balance.""I was able to exercise if I held on to something,"" she said.Medications have brought Martin moderate success to the point where she can generally walk with a cane. She belongs to an MS group called Let's Play in Los Angeles, and her disease is ""steady,"" says her doctor. But it took time in physical therapy and experimentation with four medicines.One medicine caused debilitating headaches. Another was a chemotherapy that, today, doctors know can cause heart damage. Martin managed to avoid that.Martin's current medication is Extavia, made by Bayer (BAYRY) and sold by Novartis. It requires a self-injection every other day. She began using that medicine in April when she quit using Biogen's Avonex after five years, due to headaches.Biogen has the most to lose in this battle with sales of Tysabri, Tecfidera and Avonex on the line. The second quarter is expected to be Biogen's first real test, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. Results are due to be reported Tuesday.Like Biogen's drug Tysabri, Roche's Ocrevus is considered a highly efficient MS treatment. But Tysabri's label contains a black box warning against a deadly virus that attacks the brain. Ocrevus' label doesn't.One case of that virus, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, also called PML, has been recorded by a single Ocrevus user. But that patient had just come off Tysabri after three years and had only been treated once with Ocrevus. Most analysts don't consider the case to be related to Ocrevus.The risk of PML is likely enough to prod a number of Tysabri patients to switch to Ocrevus, Syed said. Further, Biogen has estimated that a third of patients on Tysabri test positive for an ailment known as the John Cunningham virus. Those patients have weak immune systems and are more susceptible to PML.Analysts say erosion of Tysabri use will be slow. And Biogen isn't particularly worried about its MS franchise. The franchise grew 2.9% in 2016 and expanded to include Zinbryta, launched with partner AbbVie (ABBV). In the first quarter ended March 31, Biogen's MS drug sales grew just 3.1% as all but sales of Tysabri and Zinbryta fell.Chief Executive Michel Vounatsos doesn't see Biogen's MS drugs as a declining franchise, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a June 29 note to clients after a meeting with Vounatsos.""He believes Biogen may lose some market share (to Roche's Ocrevus) but believes there will be 'plenty of opportunities to grow top line,' "" Raffat said. Vounatsos ""does not believe generic Copaxone (Teva's drug) or generic Gilenya (Novartis' drug) will impact Biogen's MS franchise.""Copaxone and Gilenya face their own battles from Celgene and others. Celgene's ozanimod successfully reduced relapse rates vs. traditional interferon treatment in a Phase 3 trial that the company presented in May. Both 0.5-milligram and 1-milligram oral doses were safe and tolerable over a two-year period.Novartis' Gilenya also has its ""own safety issues,"" Mizuho's Syed said. Per the label, patients must undergo monitoring for six hours immediately following their first dose to ensure that their heart rates don't slow to dangerous levels. Gilenya has also been shown to have a toxic effect on liver enzymes.""So Gilenya was not a perfect drug,"" he said. ""(Celgene) said this is a safer Gilenya. We just saw top-line data for ozanimod. That's going to come onto the market, if it gets approved, in 2018.""So ozanimod, if successful, could gouge some of Gilenya's sales, analysts say. In the second quarter, Gilenya sales grew 5% on a constant currency basis to $837 million. That followed major growth in 2016, up 14%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, to $3.1 billion.Celgene is optimistic about its chances in the multiple sclerosis market. In a May 30 report, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges noted that management hasn't committed to first-dose monitoring but says a unique dosing schedule could minimize the need for the requirement.""On safety, Celgene management expects to show multiple points of safety differentiation from Gilenya's safety profile and to have a label that will be consistent with its Phase 2 results,"" he said.Then there's the potential generic competition that Novartis faces in 2019. A slew of generics have been approved pending patent litigation from the likes of Teva and Mylan (MYL). Analyst consensus models see $1.92 billion in 2018 Gilenya sales dropping to $447 million in 2020.""If there's nine generics approved tentatively (for Gilenya), that's a price point that's waiting to break,"" Evercore's Raffat said in a May 7 video. But Raffat says it's unlikely Gilenya will go generic in 2019. Patent litigation will likely push generic entry to 2020.And even then, Gilenya has a patent set to expire in 2027 that hasn't really been vetted, he says. The 2027 patent covers the dosing schedule and it only currently faces one challenge. Earlier, it stood up to a challenge from Apotex.Novartis is also studying a low-dose version of Gilenya at 0.25 milligrams. Gilenya is now approved as a 0.5-milligram dose.""If this trial works, it's likely very patentable,"" Raffat said. ""As of 2010 when the FDA reviewed it, the FDA said it's not clear the 0.25-milligram dose will work. That alone is your reason of knowing if the 0.25-milligram (dose) does work (in Novartis' trial), it is patentable because it's not obvious.""A new patent on Gilenya would be another obstacle to generic competition, Evercore's DiFiore said, noting ""that could nullify Gilenya going generic in 2019"" and help the broader MS industry stave off cheaper generics tugging down on drug pricing across the market.Ultimately, the competition could be a godsend for patients like Martin who are hopeful for better MS medicines with fewer side effects.""(Multiple sclerosis is) something that's difficult to describe to people because most of us look like we're doing well,"" Martin said. ""It's like a bubble. I look fine on the outside, but inside I don't feel fine.""RELATED:How Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsWill Novartis' MS Drug Stomp Celgene's Before It Even Hits The Market?How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, Novartis

263,CELG,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock neared a breakout Monday after announcing a deal with Eli Lilly (LLY) to develop an drug that could stoke the immune system to fight autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Nektar popped 3.2% to close at 22.95 after earlier rising as much as 7%. Shares are up 81% for the year, and began forming a cup with a 24.98 buy point in late March. At the same time, Lilly stock was up fractionally to 84.74.Lilly and Nektar will codevelop a drug known as NKTR-358. The drug works by stimulating a specific pathway in the body to generate a greater immune system response. By activating certain cells, NKTR-358 can act to bring the immune system back into balance, the firms said.The drug is entering Phase 1 testing to determine correct dosing. It is being developed as a once or twice monthly self-administered injection for a number of autoimmune diseases, the companies said in a news release.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat sees NKTR-358 as a potential treatment for Lupus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and ""perhaps even multiple sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease and Type 1 diabetes.""IBD'S TAKE: Nektar has an IBD Composite Rating of 56, meaning it outperforms just over half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It lags leaders like Celgene (CELG), Corcept Therapeutics (CORT) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) which have best-possible CRs of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated biotechs.Phase 1 trial information is due in the third quarter, Raffat wrote in a research report.Under the terms of the deal, Lilly will pay Nektar a $150 million upfront fee and make $250 million milestone payments. Lilly will foot the bill for 75% of the research and development costs after Phase 1 wraps up. Nektar is response for Phase 1 costs.Nektar will receive ""double-digit royalties that increase commensurate with their Phase 3 investment and product sales,"" the companies said. Nektar will be able to co-promote in the U.S. for certain treatments.Raffat noted Nektar's main program is actually a drug known as NKTR-214 which is being combined with drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY). Bristol and Nektar are looking at five tumor types. Roche and Nektar are working in lung and bladder cancer.RELATED:How This Biotech Could Dethrone Oxycodone In Treating PainIs This Small Biotech Headed For A $1 Billion Market Cap — Or A Pitfall?Bristol-Incyte Match Beats Dow's Merck In Combination Trials

IShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) and iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) tumbled 1.5% and 1%, respectively.Retail led the downside among sector plays. SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) sold off more than 2% as department stores dropped after earnings reports: Dillard's (DDS) plunged 15%, while Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) lost 8% apiece.Banks, biotechs and chips were also among the biggest losers.But gold rallied as investors sought a safe haven. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) rose a respective 1.7% and 1.2%. PowerShares DB Gold (DBO), iShares Gold Trust (IAU) and SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) were up about 1% each.Biotechs have been taking a rest after a recent run to their best levels in well over a year. ETFs that hold Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) and the like have contributed to that pause.As such, several biotech ETFs have been pulling back to their 50-day moving averages, which could set up a fresh buy opportunity on a solid bounce off the line. Early Thursday, they were trading slightly below the line.First up is iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), with total net assets of $9.3 billion. The 16-year-old fund is heading toward a potential test of its 50-day line. It gained nearly 9% from a June 21 breakout to a July 25 intraday high.IBB, which tracks the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, counted Celgene, Biogen, Gilead Sciences and Amgen among its top holdings as of Aug. 8. Celgene and Amgen have beaten the broader market this year with respective gains of 17% and 19% through Wednesday.The fund is a bit top heavy: The top five names account for around 40% of assets. Its portfolio contains 161 stocks with North America (primarily the U.S.) representing 92% and Europe 8%.IBB has outpaced the S&P 500 with a year-to-date return of 18.6% vs. 11.9% through Aug. 8, according to Morningstar Inc. It lags the benchmark index for the past three years (7.9% vs. 10.9%), but has solidly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five, 10 and 15 years. IBB has a 0.47% expense ratio.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) bounced off its 50-day line last week, but could soon test support again. Shares rose as much as 13% from a June flat-base breakout to their July 25 high.XBI, launched in January 2006, has attracted $3.5 billion in assets.

266,CELG,"A ""catch-up rally"" in the biotech sector could tack on another 15%-20% to some stocks with Celgene (CELG), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) leading the charge, an analyst said this week.XYear-to-date, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) is up 26%. Over the same time, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) is up 43%. Both are currently in buy zones. Despite this strong performance, biotech multiples are only just above their historical all-time troughs, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says.But a recovery could be underway. Large-cap biotech stocks are up 15%-20% since April 1 and beat the market ""handily"" in the second quarter.Still, biotechs continue trading at a significant discount to their pharma and medtech brethren, Porges said in a note to clients. Since 2014, the 35% and 15% premiums biotechs have enjoyed on pharma and medtech, respectively, have eroded and reversed.Porges is banking on a return on sentiment to the biotech sector.""Compared to where the revenue multiple for the group was in 2015, there is still an additional 15%-20% upside, should sentiment about the sector return to prior levels,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: One industry observer says September could be a ""make or break"" month for the biotech sector based on a number of upcoming investor and health care conferences as well as expectations for nearly a dozen trial readouts. Who could excel — or be facing a pitfall? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Recovery is already underway. In late August, Gilead Sciences (GILD) said it would pay $11.9 billion to acquire cancer play Kite Pharma (KITE). Days later, rival Novartis won approval for a key treatment, setting the stage for a key drug from Kite to be approved in November.Since that announcement, IBD's 446-company Biotech industry group has climbed 8.3% on what Porges calls a ""catch-up rally.""""To a significant extend, this is the rally that investors had been hoping and looking for, and it followed a surprisingly tepid July for the group, despite strong (second-quarter) operating results,"" Porges said.Consensus expectations in the third quarter are picking up, Porges said. Revenue views are modest, calling for an average 2%-3% growth in 2017 and 2018. And earnings per share forecasts are trending up for the first time this year.Porges is more bullish than the consensus. His top picks are outperform-rated Alexion, Celgene, Regeneron and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). Since January, even slow-growing large caps have delivered 10%-12% outperformance. Standouts among those include Regeneron, up 36%, and Vertex, up 116%.""Celgene has more pipeline optionality and has not appreciated as much lately as Alexion,"" he said. ""We are also recommending Regeneron and Vertex, although at their current valuations we see less upside in these names than for Celgene and Alexion.""RELATED:Alnylam Topples But Celgene, AstraZeneca Rise On Drug SetbacksTop Biotech Stock Near Buy Zone After FDA Drug ApprovalHow AbbVie Could Chip Away At Regeneron's Potential Blockbuster

269,CELG,"On Tuesday, the major averages fell in above-average volume. But the S&P 500 index closed above its 50-day moving average. Leading groups generally held up well. And leading stocks, from Apple (AAPL) to Wal-Mart (WMT) to FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) to biotech breakouts such as Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB), acted normally or outperformed amid a negative session.XS&P 500 futures rose 0.1% above fair value early Wednesday morning. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.15%. Dow futures advanced 0.1%.The S&P 500 index fell 0.8% in Tuesday's stock market trading. The Nasdaq composite retreated 0.9% and the Dow industrials 1.1%. With volume higher than Friday's, the market added a distribution day, which is not good. But it was the first distribution day since mid-August. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index and the Dow industrials found support at their 50-day lines after undercutting that key level intraday. The Nasdaq composite, on the heels of its best week in 2017, held above its 50-day throughout Tuesday's session.Investors should pay close attention to the action of the major averages but also that of leading stocks. And leading stocks show some strength. Apple fell 1.2% to 162.08 on Tuesday, but that's still comfortably above a 156.75 flat base buy point. Apple iPhone chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) peeked out past a buy point Tuesday morning. Skyworks pulled back, but still finished with a solid 1.3% gain.Wal-Mart rose 1.8% to 79.80, rebounding above its 50-day line as the discounter tries to retake an 80.57 cup-base buy point.Facebook dipped 0.8% after a 3.4% pop last week, still only about 2% off a buy point from its newly formed flat base. Netflix dipped 0.1%, holding above its 50-day in its own flat base.Biotechs Celgene, Biogen and CAR-T drug specialist Bluebird Bio (BLUE) ceded some ground Tuesday after all surged last week. But they closed above their buy points from last week's breakouts.Most top industry groups fell less than 1%, including video game publishers, homebuilders and biotechs. Among the higher-rated groups losing more than 1%, most were finance-related.Financials were big losers on Tuesday. Banks were hit by Treasury yields and yield spreads falling to pre-election levels. Property insurers fell as Hurricane Irma grew in strength with Florida in its sights. Airline stocks were hit by Irma and Delta Air (DAL) cutting forecasts for unit revenue and profit margins in the current third quarter.Tuesday's action was better than first impressions, while the market is in a confirmed uptrend. But as stocks grind higher with choppy action, it's difficult for investors to make much headway. A top stock may rally to a buy point and then clear it, but then quickly pull back below that entry, even though the general trend is positive. So investors should be cautious but act decisively when making purchases, taking profits and cutting losses.RELATED:The Big Picture: 2 Signs The Market Can BounceStocks Falter, But Here Are 3 Reasons Why Apple Is FineWhich FANG Stock Will Be The First To Break Out?Facebook, Boeing Lead These 5 Top Stocks Near Buys In This Bullish PatternU.S. Markets Back To Work; These 2 Top Stocks Are Racing Toward BuysStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

283,CELG,"September will be a ""make or break"" month for a number of biotechs, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY), Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Versartis (VSAR), which are expected to present Phase 3 data in the upcoming weeks.XBiotech stocks could be poised for another run, says Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar. Year to date, they've risen 28% and hit a 20-month high on Sept. 1. Shares have risen following Gilead Sciences' (GILD) announcement that it would acquire Kite Pharma (KITE).All of that comes before an incredibly newsworthy September that will feature at least five major medical conferences, at least 10 big investor conferences and nearly a dozen Phase 3 trials expected to read out, Loncar told Investor's Business Daily.""This might be the most newsworthy month in biotech history,"" he said. ""What's so amazing this September is there are a ton of Phase 3 trials that are scheduled to read out. The company itself is either going to succeed or fail because of these trial readouts.""""I count seven of them that are make or break for the companies,"" Loncar said.Loncar counts 11 key trial readouts in September. But principal among them, he notes, is Alnylam, which is expected to unveil the results of a trial of a drug dubbed patisiran for a rare disease that causes the buildup of abnormal material called amyloid throughout the body.Success could be a major catalyst for the technologies known as RNA interference and antisense, which essentially turn off malfunctioning genes, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis' IBD Relative Strength Rating was boosted Friday to 71 from 65 out of a best-possible 99. The grade shows how the stock's price moved over the past 52 weeks against all other stocks in our database. Head to IBD Data Stories to see how Novartis stacks up against its rivals.Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is also working on a Phase 3 drug, known as inotersen, to treat the disease called TTR amyloidosis.Matteis calls for an upside of 5%-15% depending on the magnitude of success and safety, and a downside of 15%-20% if the drug proves effective but mixed on safety. He sees downside of 70% if Alnylam's drug fails completely in the trial.According to Loncar, ""Most people are convinced it's going to succeed."" He cited a note that saw the range of failure to success putting Alnylam's stock price at 25 to 105 per share. It closed at 86.80 on Tuesday.""For that company, that's a $7 billion window,"" he said. ""This is a bellwether biotech company. Everyone is counting on this one to succeed, and it probably will. But if that one trial fails, the stock will crash.""Behind Alnylam, Loncar notes that Axovant is expected to announce the results of its drug dubbed intepirdine in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen (BIIB) stock broke out on strong Phase 1b data from an Alzheimer's trial.Axovant is working on a different theory of treating Alzheimer's. Intepirdine is known as a serotonin receptor antagonist, which has potential cognition, memory and learning-enhancing side effects. It was originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) but sold to Axovant.So far, nothing has worked in Alzheimer's, so there's always some excitement — and trepidation — around trial readouts for the disease, Loncar said. Last December, Eli Lilly (LLY) toppled when its drug, solanezumab, failed in a Phase 3 trial of Alzheimer's.""If Axovant does succeed, we could see a stock go from 20 to 100 in one day,"" he said. Axovant closed at 20.35 on Tuesday. ""That's extreme. But that's the kind of euphoria Alzheimer's can create.""He also notes trials from Versartis and Zogenix (ZGNX) in growth hormone deficiency and a form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome, respectively.But it won't just be September that's chock full of catalysts, Leerink analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. After ""a solid year for returns of biopharma stocks"" there are still a number of catalysts in the back half of the year.Among large-caps, Leerink's Geoffrey Porges notes that AbbVie (ABBV) will have data from trials for anti-inflammatory and cancer drugs, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is expected to grab another approval for its drug Soliris to treat a disease in which the immune system attacks healthy cells.Amgen (AMGN) could update its label for LDL cholesterol-lowering drug, Repatha, to include its added benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. Meanwhile, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are appealing a court decision vs. Amgen for their rival drug, Praluent.Celgene (CELG) will have readouts in ulcerative colitis and a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. FibroGen (FGEN) is expected to have data for fibrosis and anemia drugs. Analysts expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to provide an update with data from its cystic fibrosis trials.Gilead-Kite's CAR-T drug will likely be approved to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in November. This would follow the approval of Novartis' (NVS) Kymriah, a CAR-T drug that treats a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25.""We expect CAR-T to remain one of the most closely followed emerging areas in biotech in the second half of 2017,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note. The launch of Kymriah should read through to drugs from Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Adaptimmune Therapeutics (ADAP).RELATED:Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Shows Promise — Could It Break Out?How This J&J Partnership Bit The Dust On Gilead-Kite CompetitionCelgene Breaks Out; These 2 Biotech Giants Close On Buy PointsHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealGilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears Buy Point

298,CELG,"Perrigo (PRGO) shot to a six-month high Thursday after bucking weakness in its generic drug business and the industry overall by topping second-quarter expectations and raising its 2017 guidance.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Perrigo popped 18%, near 78.30, after earlier spiking as much as 20.4% to touch a high last seen in late February. Meanwhile, generic drug stocks collectively rebounded 3.5%.Generic drug stocks have been under pressure this month. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL), which lead the group, reported lackluster quarterly results and cut guidance. The entire group traded down for 12 straight days, but began recovering Wednesday.Early Thursday, Perrigo reported $1.24 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share, topping the consensus for $1.18 billion and 92 cents, respectively, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman wrote in a note to clients.But its generics unit is becoming less important, Steadman said. Perrigo's beat arrived on the back of its consumer business while generics declined 13% year over year in part on lower sales of Crohn's disease drug Entocort.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are better-rated than generic drug stocks. Perrigo has an IBD Composite Rating of 5 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms most stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Celgene (CELG) leads the biotech group with a CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at top-rated stocks.On a year-over-year basis, consumer sales in the Americas and internationally declined a respective 4% and 9% after Perrigo sold off unprofitable businesses last year. Excluding the impact of those sales, revenue grew 3% and 4%, respectively.""This is in stark contrast to Perrigo's current large-generic peer set facing significant pricing challenges and existential growth issues in recent quarterly announcements,"" Steadman said.The consumer unit behaves materially different from U.S. generics, Steadman noted. He expects Perrigo to shift further toward a consumer-driven business over time and, on that ""significant opportunity,"" he kept a buy rating and 80 price target on Perrigo.Perrigo also raised its 2017 guidance to adjusted income of $4.45-$4.70 per share vs. earlier views for $4.15-$4.50, and topping consensus views for $4.28, Steadman said.RELATED:Can Generic Drug Stocks Catch A Break After Mylan's Crash?How Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic DrugmakersTeva Crashes To 13-Year Low On 'Very Tough Quarter'

300,CELG,"MacroGenics (MGNX) toppled Friday after Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) terminated an agreement to develop a cancer treatment that would have rivaled drugs from Gilead Sciences (GILD)/Kite Pharma (KITE) and Novartis (NVS).XIn midday trading on the stock market today, MacroGenics dove as much as 11.5% to a six-week low, but was down 1.8% to close at 18.57. Johnson & Johnson fell 1% to finish at 131.03.J&J cited increasing competition in the space as well as neurotoxicity associated with the drug, duvortuxizumab, for its decision to bail out of the pact. Duvortuxizumab showed anti-cancer activity in a Phase 1 trial, J&J noted.Duvortuxizumab belongs to a class of drugs, known as bispecific antibodies, which stimulate an immune cell and direct it to a targeted antigen. The drug is being investigated as a potential treatment for several lymphomas and leukemias.""While bispecific antibodies hold tremendous promise, we think this news highlights some of the remaining development challenges for these agents, in particular in the context of the recent emergence of highly effective CAR-T cell therapies,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to gain approval for a CAR-T therapy, but others are just on its tail. Get the scoop on how the major players break down by visiting IBD Industry Themes.CAR-T drugs are created by extracting immune cells from a patient, and then reprogramming them to fight cancer before reintroducing them to the patient. In some cases, bispecific antibodies and CAR-T drugs have the same targets, Schmidt said in a note to clients.Earlier this week, Novartis (NVS) was the first to gain approval for a CAR-T treatment. Kite, which is being acquired by Gilead, is expected to be next. Celgene (CELG) is also partnered separately with Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) on CAR-T drugs.""How various bispecific antibody platforms currently in development differentiate clinically remains unknown,"" Schmidt said.MacroGenics has a total of seven bispecific antibody programs which have entered Phase 1 trials in recent years. It's possible bispecific antibodies could be more potent in treating solid tumors, an area that remains challenging for CAR-T drugs, Schmidt said.Schmidt reiterated his outperform rating on MacroGenics. He doesn't expect MacroGenics to continue developing duvortuxizumab in the wake of competition from CAR-T drugs and other therapies in cancers that affect what are known as B cells.RELATED:Celgene Flirts With A Breakout; Could These 2 Giants Soon Join It?Gilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears A Buy PointAnalysts Mixed On Gilead-Kite, But One Key Rival Stands To BenefitThese 4 Biotechs Just Moved Into Buy Zones; Is This Giant Next?How Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite Deal

The U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected in August.The Nasdaq composite rose 2.7% for the week, closing a fraction below an all-time record high The S&P 500 index and Dow industrials also rallied to within 1% of all-time levels.

Construction materials and other stocks seen as benefiting from post-Harvey rebuilding and purchases rebounded.Over 3 million barrels per day of refining capacity, or 16% of total U.S. capacity, was offline due to Hurricane Harvey, according to S&P Global Platts, sending gasoline futures soaring to two-year highs. Refineries could be shut for several weeks. Gas Buddy said the national gasoline average jumped by over 11 cents per gallon from the prior week with more price hikes on the way. U.S. crude futures fell as fewer refiners were available to convert oil to gasoline and other products. U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.4 million barrels in the latest week with gasoline supplies flat, the Energy Information Administration reported, but that doesn't reflect Harvey's impact. Domestic production was essentially flat at 9.53 million barrels a day, still near the record high of 9.61 million reached in June 2015.Two days after Gilead Sciences (GILD) said it would pay $11.9 billion, or $180 a share, for Kite Pharma (KITE) and pivot to cellular therapies, Novartis (NVS) was the first to grab FDA approval for a CAR-T treatment. Kymriah was OK'd to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. But Kite's drug is expected to be approved this fall to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

305,CELG,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) hit a three-week high Wednesday in the wake of the Food and Drug Administration's decision to review the biotech company's application for a rare-disease drug.XThe FDA said late Tuesday it would accept the application, also granting BioMarin priority review for its drug known as pegvaliase. Pegvaliase is a treatment for a rare disorder in which a missing enzyme leads to the buildup of an amino acid in the blood. This can result in a variety of mental, behavioral, neurological and physical problems, BioMarin says.""Investors have been cautious on pegvaliase (effectiveness) and safety profile thus far, but we believe tonight's news (Tuesday) may begin to thaw investor sentiment particularly aided by the FDA's decision to grant priority review,"" Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said.The potential approval date of Feb. 28 is likely to get pushed back to May, however, as the FDA requested additional information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls, he wrote in a note to clients.Phase 3 data for pegvaliase showed a meaningful reduction in the specific amino acid, but BioMarin has noted injection site reactions associated with the treatment, he said. This could prompt the FDA to run a panel to determine the risk/benefit of the drug.""At this point, we will have to wait and see if the agency gives further pushback,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs stocks are up more than 2% this month after Gilead Sciences' announcement this week that it would acquire Kite Pharma. An industry observer said in July an acquisition by Gilead could spike the sector Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on how this theory could pan out.Leerink's Schwartz sees a 60% probability of success for pegvaliase and assumes $530 million in peak sales in 2029, though that ""may be conservative."" He expects BioMarin to enter the market in 2018 with a respective 1,600 and 1,500 patients in the U.S. and Europe.By the closing bell on the stock market today, BioMarin had popped 5.6% to finish at 87.65, after earlier rising as much as 7.2% to its highest point in three weeks. Broadly, biotech shares hit their highest mark since July 25, up 1.5%.Another riser included Bluebird Bio (BLUE), which jumped 9.9% to close at 112.50 after Novartis (NVS) gained approval for a CAR-T drug.

315,CELG,"Ultragenyx (RARE) toppled to a 13-month low Wednesday after its drug, known as aceneuramic acid, failed in a Phase 3 trial of a rare muscle disease, prompting Ultragenyx to scrap its development.XIn early trading on the stock market today, Ultragenyx fell as much as 14% to a low last seen in July 2016, In recent trades, it was down 12.7%, near 51.35. More broadly, biotech stocks dipped a fraction.The Street wasn't particularly bullish on the drug after Ultragenyx withdrew its conditional application with the European Medicines Agency in the fourth quarter, Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote in a note to clients.Late Tuesday, sentiment tanked after Ultragenyx said aceneuramic acid's extended-release form failed to meet two key goals in a trial of patients with GNE myopathy, an inherited condition that leads to weakness and wasting of muscles in the legs and arms.Schwartz had seen just a 30%-40% likelihood of success for aceneuramic acid extended release. He noted the small size of the Phase 2 trial and problematic trial design contributed to investors' low view of the drug.IBD'S TAKE: Ultragenyx has an IBD Composite Rating of 24 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms about three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Leader Celgene (CELG) has a CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look at top-rated biotechs.""This is in stark contrast to other rare disease assets in Phase 3 development, which generally garner 60%-80% probability of success contingent on the quality and depth of supportive clinical data,"" he wrote.Even if aceneuramic acid had proved successful in GNE myopathy, it would have reached less than $100 million in peak sales by 2029, he estimated. This is ""a minor contribution for a company with a more than $2 billion market cap.""Schwartz kept his outperform rating on Ultragenyx, though he cut his price target to 83 from 89. He sees Ultragenyx entering its commercial-stage in 2018 with drugs to treat a skeletal disorder and a tissue and organ disease.RELATED:Millennials Aren't Killing This One Health MarketMedtronic Sinks After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Beat ViewsTeva And Mylan Under Pressure As Rivalries Loom For Key Drugs

317,CELG,"Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) launched to a nine-month high Wednesday after the Food and Drug Administration approved its blood cancer drug — a development that bodes well for a similar medicine in its pipeline.XIn early trading on the stock market today, Agios popped 5.1% to 61.64, rising intraday to its best levels since last November. Shares of partner Celgene (CELG) dipped 0.2% to 134.85. The approval is Agios' first.The drug, known as Idhifa, was approved to treat patients with a blood/bone marrow cancer called acute myeloid leukemia. The approval is for patients with a specific enzyme mutation whose cancer either recurred or hasn't responded to other therapy.Under the terms of Agios' deal with Celgene, Celgene has worldwide development and commercialization rights to Idhifa, and Agios has the U.S. co-promotion and royalty rights. But a similar drug, known as ivosidenib, belongs to Agios alone.Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt upgraded Agios stock to an outperform rating, and boosted his price target to 80 from 50. He cited higher conviction for Agios' drugs that target enzyme mutations associated with cancers like acute myeloid leukemia.""In our view, FDA approval of Idhifa also reduces regulatory risk for ivosidenib in acute myeloid leukemia, the latter being proprietary to Agios and hence representing a more significant value driver for the company,"" he wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Agios has an IBD Composite Rating of 51 out of a best-possible 99, which means Agios is narrowly in the top half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. See better-rated biotechs, including Celgene with a CR of 99, at IBD Stock Checkup.Agios expects to file with the FDA for ivosidenib by year's end. It's looking at the drug in acute myeloid leukemia patients with a similar mutation whose cancer has recurred or failed to respond to other therapy. Schmidt sees it grabbing approval in mid-2018.The read-through from the approval of Idhifa is positive, Schmidt said. Idhifa's approval followed a Phase 1/Phase 2 trial of 199 patients. Idhifa will have a black box on its label to warn of a condition that causes difficulty breathing, fever, weight gain and hypotension, or abnormally low blood pressure.Schmidt doesn't expect that to be a hurdle to widespread adoption. Acute myeloid leukemia specialists are familiar with the condition, known as differentiation syndrome, and with management strategies such as treatment with a corticosteroid.""We think the regulatory outcome for Idhifa validates Agios' regulatory strategy and acumen and de-risks the path to market for ivosidenib,"" he said.Needham analyst Chad Messer estimates 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia have the mutations addressed by Agios' Idhifa and ivosidenib. Idhifa could work for 8% of total acute myeloid leukemia cases. Ivosidenib could work in 12% of patients.In the trial leading to Idhifa's approval, cancer either disappeared or disappeared with partial improvement in the blood for 23% of patients. The median duration of those responses was 8.2 months.RELATED:Why Sanofi Earnings Spooked Regeneron Shares To A 6-Week LowWill Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?AstraZeneca Beats, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More Report

324,CELG,"Novartis' (NVS) approval and $475,000 price tag for a key cancer treatment had the unusual effect of helping Gilead Sciences (GILD) ride high Thursday amid continued support for Gilead's $11.9 billion acquisition of rival Kite Pharma (KITE), which is developing a similar drug.Novartis' approval came just two days after Gilead said it would pay $180 per share to acquire Kite and pivot to similar cancer drugs in the wake of struggling hepatitis C drug sales. Novartis was first to get approval for what's known as a CAR-T cancer treatment, but the approval also validates Gilead's deal for Kite, which is also developing a CAR-T drug.Also Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved a drug from Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech to treat cytokine-release syndrome, a common side effect of CAR-T therapy presenting with a fever that can sometimes be fatal.Cytokine-release syndrome is caused by an overactive immune system, Genentech explained. It can happen after CAR-T therapy in which a patient's own immune cells are extracted and reprogrammed to seek out and destroy cancer.""Until today, there has never been an FDA-approved treatment to manage severe cytokine-release syndrome associated with CAR-T cell therapy, which is marked by a rapid onset and can cause life-threatening complications,"" Genentech Chief Medical Officer Sandra Horning said in a release.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was the first to gain approval for a CAR-T drug, but other players are on the horizon. Head to IBD Industry Themes for how the battle might break down as Kite/Gilead, Juno and Bluebird each aim for approvals in the emerging sector.All told, it creates a perfect storm for Gilead and other CAR-T drug players, according to Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments. Kite's drug is expected to get approval later this fall with various drugs from Celgene (CELG) and partners Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) just behind.""With new technology for certain diseases, it's not a stretch to start using the word cure,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""They're not thinking about alleviating the symptoms of these diseases, they're thinking about fixing the genetic mutations that cause the disease.""The technology looks promising in several different blood cancers today. Novartis will charge $475,000 for its one-time CAR-T treatment for a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25. Kite's drug is being reviewed as a treatment for an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Gilead, though, sees cell therapy like CAR-T as becoming ""the cornerstone of treating cancer."" That's a big claim, Loncar says. And this is just the first iteration of CAR-T therapies.""The results so far in these initial cancers are truly amazing,"" he said. ""They're taking patients who have weeks or months to live and, in some cases, are reaching complete remissions. I've never seen anything like that before.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead lifted 3% 83.71. Novartis, meanwhile, rose 1.9%, near 84.29. Kite ticked up 9 cents to close at 177.99.Biotech stocks have broadly risen 4.3% this week as of Wednesday's close and were up 1.3% in early trading, fulfilling predictions that an acquisition by Gilead could help spike the sector. Shares touched a 19-month high in the fervor.RELATED:How Much Can This Biotech Pop After The FDA OKs Its Drug Bid?Analysts Mixed On Gilead-Kite, But One Key Rival Stands To BenefitWhy Investors Are Mute On Gilead's Acquisition Of Kite Pharma

325,CELG,"Biogen (BIIB) stock jumped and neared a buy point Monday after its Alzheimer's disease treatment showed promise at the two-year and three-year marks.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen shares climbed 2.5% 292.30, after rising as much as 3.7% to hit an intraday high of 295.50. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 297.05, though they haven't topped 297 since early March.A common theory ties Alzheimer's to the buildup of plaque deposits in the brain called beta amyloid. Biogen is among those working on drugs to reduce amyloid deposits. Last year, Eli Lilly's (LLY) anti-amyloid drug failed to prove this theory.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen has an IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it outperforms nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still trails top-rated biotech Celgene (CELG), which has a best-possible CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for other highly rated biotechs.Biogen could be closing in on proving the hypothesis. Scans showed amyloid reduction was consistent in patients treated with adjusted doses compared with fixed doses over two years. Patients treated up to three years showed a continued benefit on the rate of amyloid decline.In the Phase 1b long-term trial, the most common side effects were headache, falling and abnormalities in amyloid-related imaging, Biogen said. The firm plans to share more data at an upcoming medical congress.RELATED:Shire Nears 4-Year Low After CFO Announces Plan To Jump ShipBiogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeBiogen Up On Alzheimer's Drug; Are MS Worries 'Overblown'?

328,CELG,"The Nasdaq composite, boosted by gains in e-commerce, leisure, internet and select software industry groups, held on to thin gains with roughly an hour to go in Tuesday's session.X Solar energy stocks, meanwhile, have been on a tear lately, with the group rising more than 7% over the past five sessions. Some names, including First Solar (FSLR), Jinko Solar (JKS) and Canadian Solar (CSIQ), appear to be exiting out of bottoming base patterns.First Solar, up 3% to 44.02, has cracked through stubborn resistance at 40. In late June, shares moved past a 40.02 buy point in an elongated double-bottom-with-handle base that stretched back to a near-term peak of 42.90 seen in October. The middle peak within the base is 38.50.First Solar, a huge winner in 2007 after its late-2006 IPO, still has sloppy fundamentals as earnings dropped vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Revenue jumped 87% to $876.1 million in the first quarter of 2016, but since then results have been mixed (+4%, -46%, -49% and +2%).In IBD's Energy-Solar industry group, Vivint Solar (VSLR) is the only stock with a Composite Rating of 90 or higher, but trades below 10 a share.The S&P 500 was virtually flat as homebuilder, heavy construction, apparel and auto retail and some banking names slumped. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3% as at least four components within the 30-stock blue chip average lost 1 point or more, including Goldman Sachs (GS).Goldman dropped more than 2.5% to 223.42 in heavy trading despite notching a fourth quarter in a row of rebounding earnings and revenue. Net margin slipped by 110 basis points to 17.7%. However, the stock continues to fashion the right side of a potential new base.Notice how the stock is finding support at the 50- and 200-day lines for now.Meanwhile, biotechs continue to flex strength, and IBD's biotech group continues to rank within the top 10 among 197 industry groups for six-month relative performance. As seen in the current rankings, accessed each day via IBD Data Tables in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com, the biotech group is now No. 5, and joins four other medical groups within the top 25 rankings.The Medical sector, meanwhile, ranked No. 7 in the most recent IBD Weekly, and is up more than 21% year to date.One of the 10 current Sector Leaders hails from this sector. Abiomed (ABMD), an expert in heart pumps, edged up nearly 0.4% to 144.45 in light turnover. The stock continues to perform well since an April 24 breakout past a 126.49 cup-with-handle entry.Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, is holding above a 127.74 cup-without-handle entry. The specialist in blood cancers and other difficult diseases fell less than 0.5% to 134.38, up around 5.2% from that precise buy point. Savvy investors do not chase a stock once it's already moved more than 5% past the proper breakout point. However, a normal-looking pullback to within the proper buy zone gives an investor a second chance to scoop shares.Celgene is expected to grow second-quarter earnings 24% to $1.78 a share. In the prior eight quarters, earnings rose 37%, 27%, 17%, 23%, 17%, 28%, 36% and 27% vs. year-ago levels.Q2 revenue is seen increasing 18% to $3.24 billion, following top-line gains of 21%, 28%, 16% and 18% in the prior four periods.Apple (AAPL) continues to reflect steady institutional support, wiping away early losses to rise slightly to 149.75.As noted in a recent Stock Market Today column, a pronounced move back above the 50-day moving average would boost the prospects of a fresh breakout.Apple is showing a limited decline after its recent all-time peak of 156.65, falling no more than 9%. That's the sort of correction usually seen in a flat base pattern. Both current and prospective shareholders can watch to see if the stock can take out that high and rise at least 10 cents more, signaling a new breakout.One concern is the strength of continued sponsorship by mutual funds and hedge funds. According to data from William O'Neil + Co., 511 funds built new positions and 1,421 funds added to their stakes in the second quarter of this year, but 2,130 funds trimmed or completely sold their positions.RELATED:3 Sectors Gain As Netflix Lifts Nasdaq; Goldman Hurts Dow Top-Performing Stocks Today: Inside IBD's Stock SpotlightWill Apple Furnish A New Buy Point?Investor's Corner: What Is The Easy Method To Spot Major Market Tops?

330,CELG,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock popped to a three-month high Tuesday after the biotech said its chronic pain drug, NKTR-181, showed significantly less abuse potential compared with an oft-abused opioid.On the stock market today, Nektar stock lifted 4.6% to 21.60, after earlier rising as much as 5.9% to touch a high last seen in March. Nektar was among those leading biotech shares, alongside Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) which jumped 8.5%  to 93.45 on the approval of its cancer drug.The drug known as NKTR-181 proved to be less ""likable"" vs. oxycodone, a commonly abused chronic pain drug sold by Purdue Pharmaceuticals as OxyContin. NKTR-181 aims to treat pain without inducing euphoria associated with opioids.""It is clear from our new study results that NKTR-181 is highly differentiated in this respect from oxycodone, which is a choice drug of abuse,"" Nektar Chief Medical Officer Ivan Gergel said in a news release.Opioids act on specific receptors in the brain to relieve pain, but also target the dopamine reward system in the brain, producing euphoria and psychoactive effects, Nektar said. In 2014, nearly 2 million Americans either abused or were dependent on prescription opioids.IBD'S TAKE: Nektar stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 48 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs near the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. IBD's 438-company Biotech industry group is led by Celgene (CELG), which has a CR of 99. Visit IBD's Stock Checkup for a look at other strong names in the sector.In a Phase 3 study unveiled in March, patients with lower back pain treated with NKTR-181 reported an average pain score reduction of more than 65%, Nektar said. NKTR-181 avoids the abuse potential through ""strategic alteration of brain-entry kinetics.""Nektar's results follow a month after the Food and Drug Administration asked Endo (ENDP) to pull its opioid pain medicine, the extended-release version of Opana, from the market.

331,CELG,"Kite Pharma (KITE) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) on Tuesday topped forecasts in reporting second-quarter earnings, as Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) and Mallinckrodt (MNK) said its sales were light during the period.But Valeant cut its full-year revenue target, Ionis upped its operating profit guidance and Mallinckrodt's outlook was in line with views. Meanwhile, Kite submitted a key application with the Food and Drug Administration.XFor its second quarter, Kite reported an adjusted loss of $1.50 per share on $10.1 million in sales. Losses grew from a 91-cent loss in the year-earlier period, but topped views for a $1.97 per-share loss. Revenue spiked 110% and beat the $9 million analyst forecast.Kite also said it has submitted an application to the FDA to begin a Phase 1 trial of a CAR-T drug known as KTE-585 in multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer. The drug blocks interactions in the immune system involving the BCMA antigen. Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Celgene (CELG) are working on a similar drug.Analysts suspect Kite is months away from approval of another CAR-T drug dubbed KTE-C19 as a treatment for an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer. Rival Novartis (NVS) looks likely to grab approval in October for a CAR-T drug in a bone marrow cancer.Kite rose 3.4% to 117.46 in morning trades on the stock market today.Ionis reported an adjusted loss of 9 cents a share on a 171% sales spike to $104.15 million, compared with an adjusted loss of 47 cents and $38.47 million in revenue in the year-earlier quarter. Sales topped the $87 million view, but losses just missed the 6-cent loss per share forecast.IBD'S TAKE: Did these cancer-focused biotechs live up to expectations? Get more on what analysts expected by visiting IBD's Technology page.Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug licensed to Biogen (BIIB), had total sales of $203 million in Q2 vs. $47 million in the first quarter. Payers are now broadly covering Spinraza and launch momentum outside the U.S. is building, Ionis said in a news release.Thanks to strong Spinraza royalty revenues, Ionis now sees a full-year operating profit of about $55 million vs. its prior projection for break-even.But Ionis toppled 7%, near 48.89, in recent action.Valeant reported adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share on revenue of $2.23 billion, compared with $1.40 a share on $2.42 billion in sales in the year-earlier period. Analysts forecast adjusted profit of 97 cents per share on $2.24 billion in sales.But Valeant cut its full-year revenue target to $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion vs. its prior forecast for $8.9 billion to $9.1 billion. The drugmaker kept its 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization forecast for $3.6 billion to $3.75 billion despite the impact of divestitures this year.Valeant shot up 8% to 16.60 in morning deals.Mallinckrodt sank 6.2%, near 38.40, after reporting $824.5 million in sales, a fall of 4.9% and lagging the consensus for $827 million. Adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share plunged 8.9%, though topped analyst views by 12 cents. Branded drugs grew 0.9%, whereas Mallinckrodt's generic unit advanced 18%.The UK-based drugmaker also reiterated its full-year guidance for $7.40-$8 adjusted earnings per share. That's in line with the expectations of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $7.53 a share.Irina Koffler, a Mizuho analyst, credited Mallinckrodt's ""lower quality"" bottom-line beat to taxes. Specialty generics outperformed expectations, though, ""which was a positive development, in our view and hopefully the start of its stabilization,"" she wrote in a note to clients.She kept her buy rating on Mallinckrodt.RELATED:Why This Biotech Is Jumping Today On Its Rival's Cannabis-Tied DrugGilead Could Be Making An Acquisition — But It's Not What You ThinkThe Surprising Reason Regeneron Toppled Despite Its Beat-And-Raise

332,CELG,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are most likely to beat Wall Street views for June quarter sales and profits, an analyst said Monday.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the ""stars align for widespread beats in Q2 biopharma results."" Among large caps, he also sees AbbVie (ABBV), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead as most likely to top revenue expectations.Quarter over quarter, though, sales from AbbVie, Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to be slow, he said.""Both AbbVie and Biogen are facing competition and pricing pressures, while Alexion and Vertex are still high-growth companies with temporary slowing in their revenue growth trajectory pending new indications, formulations or products,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Health tracker IMS sees AbbVie's leukemia drug Imbruvica and testosterone gel AndroGel as likely to come in materially north of the consensus, with immunosuppressant Humira landing about 0.6% above Street views. But other major projects are expected to miss.IMS data suggest Biogen's multiple-sclerosis drugs Tysabri and Tecfidera could beat Porges' estimates by 18.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Tecfidera, however, is expected to miss the Street by 1.3% and MS drugs Plegridy and Avonex are forecast to be light.This comes amid growing competition in the MS field from the likes of Roche (RHHBY), Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY). Roche's drug, Ocrevus, was approved earlier this year to treat both relapsing-remitting as well as primary progressive MS — a first for the industry.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, as sentiment ticks up ahead of the second-quarter earnings season. Make sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry News for the latest on the sector.Major drugs from Celgene are expected to top the consensus by 4.9% with chemotherapy Revlimid likely to come in 5.1% above the consensus, Porges wrote. Pomalyst, a drug to treat a blood cancer, is expected to be 5.8% higher than the consensus.Gilead is likely to be the biggest second-quarter surprise. Per IMS data, Gilead's sales could top by 10%, ""though this is largely dependent upon the reliability of recent hepatitis C data, which have been unreliable in the past."" Hepatitis C drug sales toppled in 2016 amid high cure rates.Without accounting for highly variable sales of hepatitis C drugs, Gilead's total sales would miss Porges' forecast by 0.1% and the analyst consensus target by 1.7%. At the same time, Gilead's Genvoya, an HIV drug, could beat the consensus by 7%-9%, Porges wrote in a note to clients.Amgen (AMGN) is most likely to match or slightly underperform the consensus, Porges said. Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel is expected to be in line with consensus views, though it could top Porges' view by as much as 1.9%, per IMS data.Bone health drug Prolia and bone marrow stimulating Aranesp are projected to beat by 6%-7%, which could help offset expected sales misses by bone health drug Xgeva and other bone marrow stimulant drugs, Porges said.""However, the changing price dynamic for many of Amgen's products makes the IMS adjustment factors less reliable,"" Porges wrote. He calls for Amgen to hike some of its prices in July after bumping the price of cancer drug Kyprolis by 3.9% in April.On the adjusted profits per share side, Gilead has a chance to beat consensus views by 11.1%, Porges said. Regeneron and Vertex could also top expectations by 8.1% and 7%, respectively.But Biogen could miss earnings views by 10.6% due to a one-time research-and-development expense not fully recognized across analysts' estimates, Porges said. AbbVie, too, is likely to miss adjusted earnings per share by 3.2%, he said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was down fractionally.RELATED:Could Q2 Surprise Spike This Beleaguered Biotech's Stock?Gilead Could Acquire This Biotech — But Vertex Is Still Better: AnalystWhy This Biotech Could Be Poised For A Run After Toppling 52% In June

333,CELG,"Novartis (NVS) was the first drugmaker to cross the finish line in developing cancer treatments known as CAR-T drugs Wednesday after the Food and Drug Administration approved its drug, Kymriah, for children and adults with a type of bone marrow cancer.XKymriah, a cell-based gene therapy, was approved to treat patients up to age 25 with what's called B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Its approval is likely to set the stage for the FDA to approve a slew of CAR-T drugs over the next several years.""We're entering a new frontier in medical innovation with the ability to reprogram a patient's own cells to attack a deadly cancer,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a news release following the approval. ""New technologies such as gene and cell therapies hold out the potential to transform medicine and create an inflection point in our ability to treat and even cure many intractable illnesses.""The approval comes days after Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced its $11.9 billion plan to acquire Kite Pharma (KITE), which is also closing in on approval of a CAR-T therapy. In this treatment, immune cells are extracted from a patient and reprogrammed to fight cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks broadly dipped in mid-August, but have since rallied to be up 2.3% this month. Could this be an inflection point needed to top an earlier chill outlined in IBD Industry Themes?Analysts expect Kite's drug to grab approval to treat an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma later this year. Analysts see Juno Therapeutics' (JUNO) drug getting approval next year, followed closely by Celgene (CELG) partner Bluebird Bio (BLUE).But by the closing bell on the stock market today, Novartis dropped 1.1% to 82.74, while Gilead spiked 7.3% to close at 81.23. Kite was at a relative standstill, down marginally to 177.90.

334,CELG,"Analysts were mixed Tuesday on Gilead Sciences' (GILD) $11.9 billion takeout of Kite Pharma (KITE), but one thing is certain, they said — rivals Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stand to benefit from the headlines.XNovartis (NVS) and Kite are expected to gain Food and Drug Administration approval this fall for blood cancer drugs known as CAR-T treatments. But Celgene (CELG) partners Juno and Bluebird are just behind, Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten wrote in a note to clients.""We believe Juno and Bluebird, the two leading independent CAR-T developers, are obvious (acquisition) plays following Kite's takeout,"" he said. Other earlier-stage potential targets include Intellia (NTLA), Fate Therapeutics (FATE) and Tesaro (TSRO).Juno stock rushed to a 14-month high midday on the stock market today, popping 20.1% to 43.81, reaching a high last seen in June 2016. Bluebird, though, sank 3.7% to end the trading session at 102.40. Gilead climbed 1.4% to 75.74 while Kite slipped 0.1% to 177.95. Novartis lifted 0.4% to 83.62.All are working on treatments in which a patient's own immune cells are reprogrammed to seek out and destroy cancer. Novartis's CAR-T treatment looks likely to gain approval to treat a bone marrow cancer, followed closely by Kite with a treatment for an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector closed up 2.5% on Monday, helped by news of Gilead's deal for Kite. Head to The Big Picture for more on how Gilead-Kite boosted the sector and what other sectors rode up Monday.Nierengarten boosted his price target on Juno to 42 from 24 and upgraded the stock to an outperform rating from neutral. Juno closely rivals Kite with a CAR-T drug known as JCAR017. Gilead's entry into the space will likely help boost the adoption rate for JCAR017, he said.He expects Juno's JCAR017 to grab FDA approval before year's end in 2018 and doesn't see a lasting disadvantage to being later to market. The initial launch of Gilead/Kite's drug, known as axicabtagene ciloleucel, will be hung up on investments in transplant centers and reimbursement talks.""We believe Juno could capitalize on Gilead's and Novartis' efforts with its later arrival,"" he said. ""We see JCAR017's profile as sufficiently differentiated in both efficacy and safety to enable for broader adoption relative to axicabtagene ciloleucel.""Nierengarten forecasts peak $2 billion in U.S. sales for Juno's CAR-T drugs in blood cancers, exceeding his expectations for peak U.S. sales of Gilead/Kite's drugs in blood cancers. He sees Juno's drugs as being the preferred choice over Novartis' and Gilead/Kite's.But ""any way you cut it, the Kite deal is expensive,"" Nierengarten said. The deal values Kite at seven times peak sales expectations of $1.7 billion for axicabtagene ciloleucel. This compares to the typical four-times-sales takeout for biotech.""We do not believe another buyer will emerge for Kite, as (the) price point indicates Gilead is not dealing from a position of strength,"" he wrote. The long-term rationale assumes Kite's drug will be able to expand into other cancers.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges classified the deal as ""hardly a surprise, hardly a triumph and hardly transformative."" He kept his market perform rating on Gilead but cut his price target to 82 from 83.""While this pivot may represent a new look for Gilead, and perhaps Kite is well positioned in the CAR-T space, we do not believe this changes the underlying fundamentals that have plagued Gilead's stock over the past two years,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Gilead has been under pressure to buy something as its hepatitis C drug franchise has begun declining amid high cure rates. Still, the drivers for Gilead's outlook remain hepatitis C and HIV treatments, Porges said.Kite will do little to fend off expected revenue declines of $27 billion and $24 billion in 2017 and by 2019, respectively, for Gilead.

She reiterated her outperform rating on Gilead stock and boosted her price target to 85 from 79.""We think this deal marks the beginning of a new chapter,"" she wrote in a note to clients.

"
335,CELG,"Kite Pharma (KITE) won't be Gilead Sciences' (GILD) next Pharmasset, an analyst said Monday after Gilead announced the $11.9 billion merger — sending Kite stock into the stratosphere.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Kite rocketed 28% to finish at near 178.05, hitting a record high about three years after it filed its initial public offering. But Gilead stock was less enthusiastic, rising 1.2% to close at 74.69.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat says there's no guarantee acquiring Kite will be as transformative for Gilead as its $11 billion bet on Pharmasset in 2011. The Pharmasset deal gave Gilead access to a key drug that kicked off its blockbuster hepatitis C franchise.""Both deals are generally comparable in size, and the enormous commercial success of Pharmasset deal is still very fresh in investors' eyes,"" Raffat wrote in a note to clients.But Pharmasset was the clear leader in its class, whereas Kite is just one in a pack of companies working on what are known as CAR-T therapies, which harnesses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. Novartis (NVS), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE)/Celgene (CELG) are also working in this arena.Further, the logistics are different. Hepatitis C drugs are pills taken once daily. In CAR-T therapies, a patient's blood is drawn into a vial and then the immune system cells are reprogrammed to fight cancer before being reintroduced to the body. That requires a specific infrastructure, Raffat noted.And there's no proof of concept in the ""blue sky scenario."" Kite is trailing Novartis in CAR-T therapies with both expected to gain approvals in blood cancers later this year. But the firms have yet to prove a similar concept in solid tumors called T-cell receptor technology.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have slowed down from a July spike as long-term views on several players look dim. Could Gilead's acquisition of Kite help them recover? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.Still, ""the true inflection points in the Kite story are yet to come,"" he said. Kite is closing in on approval of its drug, axicabtagene ciloleucel, to treat an aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It will have first-mover advantage in that setting.The deal is set to close in the fourth quarter, Gilead said in a news release. This means ""2018 will now become a very important year,"" Raffat said. The ""Street will be very focused on validating this purchase.""Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the consensus is calling for Kite's drug to reach $1.6 billion in peak sales by 2022. He sees three initial approvals in blood and bone marrow cancers, and notes trials are ongoing in three other blood cancers.""The transaction is not a complete surprise"" given earlier commentary, he wrote in a note to clients. The 30% premium on Kite's stock after shares have risen 210% year to date ""is bracing and suggests that Gilead is expecting revenue of $2 billion to $3 billion from Kite's CAR-T platform.""Kite was already on the short-list as a potential acquisition for Gilead. In the first quarter, Gilead had said it wanted to do a deal in cancer, and analysts suggested Kite, Incyte (INCY), Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) could be on the list.But as recently as several weeks ago, Kite Chief Executive John Milligan reportedly said the firm ""might end up doing nothing in oncology"" if the right deal doesn't present itself. The Street has been pushing Gilead to make a deal as its hepatitis C drug sales have begun to decline.Gilead's key strategy going forward will be ""cell therapy."" The firm has suggested it could seek to buy assets to enhance CAR-T engineering or immuno-oncology drugs to augment its drugs in different combinations.RELATED:Gilead Sciences Will Buy Kite Pharma For $11.9 BillionWhy Gilead Might Do 'Nothing In Oncology' As Key Drugs ToppleHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

343,CELG,"After a ho-hum 2016, $12.1 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is having a hi-ho 2017. The fund's 2.62% setback last year badly lagged the S&P 500's 11.96% gain. It trailed 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. But its 21.24% gain this year going into Thursday more than doubled the big-cap bogey's 10.32% return and trumped 89% of its direct rivals.XThe fund's rally reflects the market's shift away from defensive, low-growth staples-providers and higher-dividend stocks, which dominated for much of last year, to the sort of higher growth stocks that the fund favors. Fund co-manager Patrick Burton — on this job since early 2013 — says leading technology stocks in particular have been buoyed by market-share gains and strong earnings. Burton and lead manager Justin Kelly are with subadvisor Winslow Capital.Reflecting that market tilt, the fund has been boosted this year by such holdings as Alibaba Group (BABA), which is up 66%. The fund also holds graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), which is up 46% this year. Digital-media and marketing-software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) is up 39%. Biomed Celgene (CELG), which is up 14%, is a fast grower in health care.""Alibaba is the No. 1 player in e-commerce in China,"" Burton said. It is benefiting from the shift to mobile devices. Gross sales are still growing rapidly despite its size. And Alibaba Cloud, like Amazon Web Services, is growing very fast, he says.Nvidia is benefiting from a shift toward the use of graphics processing units (GPU), away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, Burton says.Adobe is shifting from selling software licenses to annual subscriptions. ""Customers churn less and buy more"" under that model, Burton says.Celgene stock is up due to a combination of decent earnings and attractive valuation ""since biotech has been under pressure for a couple of years,"" Burton said.Over the past 10 years, the fund's 8.18% average annual gain topped 72% of its rivals. Winslow's Kelly has been at the helm since late 2005.The fund aims to navigate through various market phases by adjusting its allocations among three types of growth stocks.One bucket holds stocks that the managers see as long-term, sustainable earnings growers. The second bucket holds quality cyclical growers, which may be more volatile. And the third holds stocks in newer industries with rapid growth.Visa (V) is a sustainable grower. Its takeover of Visa Europe boosts economies of scale and leads to better coordination of global marketing campaigns, Burton says, adding, ""It's a really steady Eddie, consistent grower.""Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is one of the fund's cyclicals. They supply radio frequency filters for Apple (AAPL), Samsung and Chinese cellphones. ""What's changing is that they are moving into other products that need wireless applications like Tesla (TSLA) (cars),"" Burton said. ""They are pushing to get involved in the internet of things.""ServiceNow (NOW) is a new-industry stock, which is expanding from IT management for clients into new areas like cybersecurity and human resources.Celgene, whose cancer drug Revlimid is its flagship, is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. The group is ranked No. 8 among 197.Wall Street expects earnings per share to climb 23% this year. Pretax margin last year of 50.4% was its highest in at least nine years.IBD'S TAKE: You can check out more of Celgene's fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Illumina (ILMN) and Netflix (NFLX) were new additions to the fund's portfolio in the second quarter.Illumina is a leader in low-cost gene-sequencing equipment. Burton said, ""We believe Illumina will demonstrate an accelerating growth profile over the course of this year and next, driven by the launch of its new gene-sequencing instrument, Novaseq. We believe this acceleration will drive upside to (analysts') consensus (earnings) estimates.""Netflix returned to the portfolio after being sold. Its EPS rose 50%, 71%, 114% and 567% in the past four quarters.Netflix is facing increasing competition from Hulu and stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN) and YouTube-owner Google (GOOGL) — both also owned by MainStay Large Cap Growth. Netflix's drivers are its original programming and global expansion, Burton says.RELATED:MainStay Large Cap Growth Sees Market Tilting Toward Its Favorite Types Of Growth Stocks

344,CELG,"XU.S. stock indexes rallied midday Wednesday on strength in the biomed space.The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 added less than 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was barely below the day's break-even line. Volume rose on both major exchanges.Biomed stocks showed exceptional strength. In the Nasdaq 100, five of the day's top six gainers were biomed stocks. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) rose 6%; Incyte (INCY), 5%; BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), 4%; Biogen (BIIB), 3.5%; and Celgene (CELG), 3%.Celgene broke out of a consolidation, clearing a 127.74 buy point in volume that soared more than 300% above average. The pattern is first stage. Celgene has been consolidating for almost two years. A consolidation that long will push down the Relative Price Strength Rating and that is what has happened with Celgene. The RS rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is 68, which means the stock is lagging about a third of the market in price performance.IBD-style investors will put less emphasis on the RS Rating when it comes from a long consolidation.Celgene's earnings picture is solid. The Street expects earnings to rise 23% this year and 21% in 2018. Pretax margin last year was 50.4%, the best in at least nine years.Blue chips meanwhile were mostly down. Losers led winners by a 4-3 ratio. Intel (INTC) and Caterpillar (CAT) were the day's biggest losers in the 30-stock Dow. Both fell about 1.5%.In the S&P 500, the day's top gainer was CA Inc.

345,CELG,"Talk about hot! Brian Demain is lead manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise (JANEX), which is an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. So is the fund's twin, $1 billion Aspen Enterprise (JAAGX), of which he also is skipper.XThe portfolios won Best Funds honors by outperforming the S&P 500 in four time periods ended Dec. 31 — the trailing one, three, five and 10 years.And they did so in not just one category but in three — diversified equity mutual funds, growth mutual funds and midcap mutual funds.That put them into a small group of gems. A mere 44 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, out of 1,104 with assets of at least $100 million, prevailed as winners across those four time spans.Demain and Cody Wheaton run the funds with little turnover, just 20% now, according to Morningstar Inc. Among both portfolios' holdings are Crown Castle (CCI), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Global Payments (GPN), Sensata Technologies (ST) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD). All are either forming basing patterns or in buy ranges.Enterprise is open to investors who already own shares. It's also open to old or new shareholders in 401(k) plans that already offer the fund, as well as to old or new investor clients of a wirehouse brokerage that offers the identical strategy through a separately managed account. Twin sister Aspen Enterprise can be bought by old or new investors through some insurance companies.A midcap fund at Janus Henderson that is still open to new investors is $4 billion Mid Cap Value (JMIVX).Demain, who is 40 years old, talked about his investment approach and several key stock holdings in a recent interview with IBD:IBD: Brian, summarize your investment approach.Demain: First, we look for what we call sustainable growth. We want companies that are growth companies today and will be three, five, seven years from now. They may not be the fastest growers, but they can grow for the long term.Second, we're looking for companies with sustainably high returns on invested capital. It's great if a company can grow. But if it's not earning high returns on invested capital, it's not increasing shareholder value. So we try to understand a company's competitive advantage, because that's what will drive its long-term return on invested capital.Third, we care about the quality of a company's management team. We like management teams that focus on the right areas, and that are good leaders.If we find companies that meet those three criteria and we can buy them at attractive valuations and hold them for the long term, we can outperform our peers.IBD: The fund's performance is consistent, as shown by its being an IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winner. Is the key its outperformance during up markets or during down markets?Demain: We've generally been able to keep up in up markets and outperform in down markets. We try to have a predicted beta (a measurement of volatility relative to the market or benchmark) against our Russell MidCap Growth Index benchmark of between 0.85 and 1, so we have less absolute risk than the benchmark. But it's higher than 0.85, because we don't want to only outperform in a down market. That's where we want to shine, but we do OK in up markets as well.IBD: Why do you like midcaps?Demain: They're not as mature as large caps, so they have real growth opportunities ahead of them. But their business models are more established than small caps'.Many have withstood competitive challenges, which small caps may not have. But they tend to be less volatile than small caps.IBD: You've got about 70% of your assets in the technology, industrials and health care sectors. Why do you expect to find so many opportunities in those spaces?Demain: With tech and health care, it is the power of innovation. In tech, we've been overweight in hardware and semiconductors. The mobile internet is driving semiconductor growth. And we're seeing a lot of innovation in software pushing itself into our lives.In health, we own biotechs, pharmaceuticals, life-science tools and diagnostic companies. Aging baby boomers and an emerging middle class globally are driving innovations in drug development and diagnostics.IBD: You've noted that corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation may not occur as fast as many investors have hoped. How have you hedged your bets on those areas?Demain: Take tax cuts. Sensata is a Netherlands domiciled company (which makes sensors for aircraft, cars and other products) but it does business in the U.S. It pays a low tax rate because of where it is domiciled, so it will not benefit from lower U.S. rates.We also own TD Ameritrade (which is a brokerage). It pays a full tax rate, so if there's reform it will benefit. But policy changes can cut both ways. Ameritrade also benefits from rising interest rates. It sweeps clients' cash balances into TD Bank and earns more money on that spread as rates rise. And we own Crown Castle (a REIT that owns wireless cell towers). It has high levels of borrowing, so it will be hurt by high interest rates.IBD: Lam Research (LRCX) must be one of your semiconductor plays. Describe it, please.Demain: They are a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. In the last few years, we've gone from everything being etched on one plane of each microchip to effectively stacked layers on chips. So a lot of growth has gone to etching deposition players like Lam.In addition, demand in the memory market is robust. That's driven by uptake in solid-state drives. We're going from the old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. That demands lots of chips, which is good for Lam.And we like their valuation. The stock trades at 13.5 times forward earnings. If you back out their cash, it is close to 12 times. The market's multiple is north of 18 times. And several high quality semiconductor companies are trading at 20 times.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is best known for Revlimid, its blood-cancer treatment. Do you like its other products?Demain: You're right, Revlimid is its workhorse and continues to grow due to longer treatment duration and finding new patients. But what do they do after Revlimid goes off-patent in 2026?The outlook for three other Celgene products — Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane — is constructive. And we're excited about its pipeline of new (treatments). Also, they've done business development deals with cash from Revlimid to build emerging franchises in gastroenterology and immunology, and inflammation and immunology. Those things should make the 2026 patent cliff for Revlimid a manageable event.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is ranked a very strong No. 4 among 197 groups. Celgene earns its top-dog status thanks to such traits as a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an annual pretax margin of 50.4, which is the highest it's been in at least nine years. Compare its other technical and fundamental strengths to its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.IBD: Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth has accelerated for six quarters in a row. Does your thesis revolve around the fact that their chips are used in a variety of products?Demain: The majority of their revenue is from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that can go into all sorts of devices from airplanes to microwave ovens to kids' toys. That has great growth dynamics, which is a function of the growth of the Internet of Things. That's the company's sustainable growth.That business has a very fragmented customer base. You're not just selling a ton of chips to one customer like Apple (AAPL). You're selling to thousands of end markets. That's their competitive advantage.As for a good management team, the company is led by Steve Sanghi. We have high regard for his value creation. The company recently acquired Atmel, which was a large microcontroller competitor. It had good assets, but was poorly managed. Sanghi has improved operating margins and driven strong earnings growth. And valuation is not that demanding at about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: How does SS&C Technologies (SSNC) illustrate your investment approach?Demain: This is another example of sustainable growth plus competitive advantage plus strong management. SS&C provides back-office services for financial companies. As asset management matures, more companies want to focus on their core competencies. Rather than run back offices in-house, they look to outsource. And once they are embedded with a customer, other departments at the customer may outsource to them as well.SS&C is run by Bill Stone, who has a proven record of value creation. And their valuation is reasonable.IBD: Global Payments' earnings per share growth has sped up. Why?Demain: Think of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as electronic payment highways. Global Payments is the on- and offramp. They have relationships with merchants who accept credit card terminals. If you run a restaurant, for example, Global gives you software that not only accepts credit cards but also helps you run your restaurant. And Global has benefited from consolidation.IBD: What makes Heico (HEIA), which designs and repairs parts for aircraft and engines, attractive to you?Demain: Only certain approved suppliers can sell parts to airlines. Planes are in service for 25, 30 years, and need servicing. But only a relatively small number of companies have parts-manufacturing approval (PMA) from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European (regulatory) body. The FAA has (limited resources) and can only approve so many parts per year. Heico has the best position in the PMA market. They earn healthy margins.Also, the Mendelson family owns a large percentage of the company. It's most of their liquid net worth, so they care a lot about creating shareholder value, so we like to partner with them.IBD: What's driven the share-price uptrend by contact-lens developer Cooper (COO)?Demain: We like their sustainable growth. Contact lens are a growing category as contacts get more comfortable. They also benefit from international growth.There are only four players: Bausch & Lomb, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alcon and Cooper. Once a consumer picks one, they usually stick with it and won't change because of a small price difference.IBD: Why is index operator MSCI attractive?Demain: The way to think about them is that they benefit from the growth of ETFs. An active manager like Janus Henderson pays a fixed fee for access to a benchmark operator. For MSCI, when a fee dollar moves from an active to a passive fund, that dollar becomes more profitable.And once you are a standard index, it is hard (for users) to change.IBD: By the way, any plans to reopen Enterprise Fund to all investors?Demain: No, we are managing $18 billion (including money in Aspen Enterprise and in separately managed accounts using Enterprise's strategy). It makes us one of the larger midcap strategies. Our first priority is working on behalf of existing clients. They think being closed is in their best interests and that's why we've done this.RELATED:Winning Mutual Fund Focuses On Leading Stocks Like Autohome, MarketAxess7 Steps For Millennials Who Want To Become Rich Retirees

346,CELG,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) stock popped Tuesday on strong data from a hemophilia study, though plans for a ""one and done"" solution in an upcoming Phase 3 trial will likely discomfit some investors.BioMarin stock rose 1.3% to 90.92 on the stock market today, after earlier bounding as much as 2.4%. Shares have been consolidating since last August with a buy point at 102.59.The pop followed BioMarin's release during the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis in Germany. There, BioMarin said its drug known as BMN 270 increased the presence of a key protein in patients with severe hemophilia.Hemophilia is a bleeding disorder typically caused by a lack of a blood-clotting protein called Factor VIII. The normal range of Factor VIII activity levels in healthy patients is 50% to 150%. Patients with severe hemophilia have less than 1% Factor VIII activity levels in their blood.Seven patients treated with a high dose of BMN 270 achieved an average 129% Factor VIII activity level by week 24, BioMarin said. By week 52, these patients had an average Factor VIII activity level of 104%, which is in the normal range.IBD'S TAKE: BioMarin stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 61 out of a best-possible 99 based on key growth metrics across all stocks. But it lags better-rated players like Celgene (CELG) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN). Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look.Six patients on a lower dose hit an average 33% Factor VIII activity level by week 24 — in the mild range for hemophilia.BioMarin is advancing the higher dose into a Phase 3 trial planned for the fourth quarter. But Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz says investors will likely be concerned that the dose is higher than necessary.""The rationale, we believe, is to deliver a true 'one and done' curative therapy with a high likelihood of achieving normal Factor VIII levels with long-lasting efficacy that can garner favorable decisions from the reimbursement discussions,"" he wrote in a note to clients.There were no alarming side effects of BMN 270, but half of the low-dose patients received a tapering course of corticosteroids to help contend with an increase of an enzyme called alanine aminotrasferase in the blood.""Based on multiple hemophilia studies, elevations in alanine aminotrasferase now appear to be a common theme,"" he said. ""Although some investors may find corticosteroid intervention to be a lingering concern, we view its transient nature and lack of repercussion on Factor VIII levels as encouraging.""RELATED:These Biotechs Are Grabbing Bullish Views In Wake Of EarningsSanofi Could Acquire This Biotech, But Is $1 Billion Too Low?Did Sanofi Just Bag This Biotech For $1 Billion?

347,CELG,"Dow component Merck (MRK) stock toppled late Wednesday after the Food and Drug Administration put three clinical trials on hold involving the drugmaker's immuno-oncology med, Keytruda, in a blood cancer known as multiple myeloma.Trials of Keytruda and low-dose Dexamethasone combined with either Pomalyst or Revlimid, from Celgene (CELG), were placed on full clinical holds. Another similar combination study was placed on a partial clinical hold.Last month, Merck paused enrollment in two of those trials after more patients receiving Keytruda died. On Wednesday, the FDA said the risks of those combinations outweighed the potential benefits.IBD'S TAKE: Merck has an IBD Composite Rating of 59, meaning it outperforms nearly six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the best-rated drugmakers.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Merck stock was off an additional 1%, near 63.50. It ended the regular trading session down a fraction, to 64.16. Shares have been forming a flat base since early March. Merck is one of three biopharmaceutical companies on the Dow Jones industrial average.RELATED:Dow's Merck Pauses Cancer Trials To Investigate Keytruda-Tied DeathsBristol Beats Itself In Cancer Test; Can It Conquer Dow's Merck?AstraZeneca's Cancer Trial Could Help Out A Rival, Analyst Says

348,CELG,"The biotech boom peaked in July 2015, and as the industry slowly recovers from its slump one of the biggest biotech ETFs is looking more attractive.SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) is trading near 52-week highs, approaching a potential buy point of 72.68 in a flat base. The ETF has moved back above its 50-day moving average in the past couple of weeks, which strengthens its chart.IBD's biotech industry group has been in the top 15 of 197 groups for many weeks, reflecting the industry's comeback. Yet, it is still short on stocks with superior fundamentals that are near proper buy points. Even many of the stocks with high IBD Composite Ratings are low-priced stocks or otherwise lacking. A few are still unprofitable companies.The SPDR Biotech ETF, though, provides a way to invest in the sector's broad advance without having to find specific stocks. Buying the index also can provide some buffer against company-specific risks, which can be big in biotechs. Poor clinical trials or a rejected drug application are risks on top of the usual investor worries such as earnings reports.The fund owns about 90 stocks, including industry heavyweights such as Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Amgen (AMGN). But some of the largest holdings in terms of portfolio weight are small-cap or midcap companies such as Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) and Exelixis (EXEL). On Tuesday, Exelixis broke out of a base but retreated right back below the 23.59 buy point the next day.The ETF selects stocks mainly on revenue, but earnings and ""market perception"" are also considered, according to the prospectus. All stocks are picked from the S&P Total Market Index, a broad domestic gauge, and must have a market capitalization above $500 million and certain liquidity ratio requirements. The average weighted market cap is about $17 billion.SPDR S&P Biotech rose more than 20% in the first three months of 2017. It has an average annual gain of 13.9% the past three years and 21.3% the past five years.That compares favorably to iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), another widely held ETF. That fund rose about 12% in the first quarter, and the three-year average return is 7.6% and the five-year average return is 19.2%. The iShares biotech ETF is more heavily weighed on the industry giants.The industry outlook is difficult to measure. Much of it depends on new drugs hitting the market, and there's been pressure on drugmakers to cut prices on some costly medicines.""Growth prospects for the sector have been in decline and the drug pricing debate is extremely difficult to handicap,"" Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said of the health care sector in a report last Monday.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market. A computer algorithm selects the ETFs based on relative strength and other objective performance ratings, with periodic adjustments for market trends and conditions. The universe from which the ETFs are selected includes the funds listed below.RELATED:S&P 500 ETF Nears New High With Apple As Its Largest HoldingBiotechs Cruise On 6-Day Upswing Despite Price Target Cuts For This Duo

349,CELG,"Shares of biotech leader Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) briefly broke out Tuesday, but struggled to remain above that key level of support as IBD's 425-company Biomed-Biotech industry group broadly fell.On the stock market today, Supernus stock lifted as much as 4% to top a 32.10 buy point out of an ascending base that began in February. Shares settled back below that buy point by the closing bell and ended the regular session up 1.9% to 31.85.Meanwhile, biotech stocks collectively lost 1.4%. Agios Therapeutics (AGIO), Audentes Therapeutics (BOLD) and Galapagos (GLPG) stocks were among the biggest losers, dropping a respective 9.3%. 6.9% and 3.3%.Supernus is ranked second in the biotech industry group with a Composite Rating of 98, meaning it outperforms all but 2% of stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It trails Celgene (CELG), and is tied with Bioverativ (BIIV), Corcept Therapeutics (CORT), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Cytokinetics (CYTK) in its group.IBD'S TAKE: Want more information on highly-rated stocks? Head to IBD Stock Checkup for your smartest picks.Biotech stocks dropped below their 50-day moving average on April 5. But the group is still ranked No. 7 out of 197 groups tracked, down from No. 5 last week but still a big boost over No. 48 just 13 weeks ago.RELATED:To Biotech May 'Unveil' Breakthrough Treatment — And Breakout MoveBiotech Bolts Higher On Drug Results

350,CELG,"Drug stocks toppled to a five-month low Tuesday after Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported first-quarter pharma sales that only advanced 0.8%, offering a weak harbinger for the sector.In late afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group was down a fraction after earlier losing as much as 1.4%, touching a low not seen since November.Biotech stocks were less injured, but were still down 1.2% after collectively losing as much as 1.8% after J&J reported light first-quarter sales, despite a 6-cent beat on the bottom line.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says J&J's results highlight ""multiple Q1 issues for large biotechs."" Worldwide pharma sales of $8.25 billion grew just 1% vs. the year-earlier quarter and missed expectations by 1%.International drug sales beat by 2%, but U.S. pharma sales missed by 5%, Porges wrote in a research report. Oncology sales led growth while legacy products — Remicade, Stelara and Xarelto — offset volume declines or low growth with price hikes.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), AbbVie (ABBV) and Celgene (CELG) — which derive a large portion of sales from international markets — should benefit if J&J's worldwide pharma growth is reflected across the sector. Porges has an outperform rating on Alexion stock and market perform ratings on AbbVie and Celgene stocks.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Ethical Drugs industry group is now ranked No. 161 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 182 just 13 weeks ago. But the biotech industry group is performing much better, ranked seventh this week. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the strongest stocks.But higher utilization of independent patient assistance programs, timing of Medicare Part D costs and higher drug access discounts will leave Celgene and Amgen (AMGN) vulnerable among biotechs, Porges said, citing commentary by J&J. He has a market perform rating on Amgen stock.""While pricing power appears to remain strong, J&J did report that lower prices in government managed care channels impacted annual comparisons,"" he wrote. ""We do not anticipate that these issues will be isolated to J&J alone, but should impact the broader biopharma industry.""For drugmakers, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted J&J's struggle in its diabetes unit — Invokana sales were down 17% year over year — could be reflected in Eli Lilly's (LLY) diabetes franchise. Though Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez earlier said the unit could help Lilly overcome struggles with its rheumatoid arthritis drug.Raffat noted pricing pressure for cardiovascular drug Xarelto could be reflected in Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Eliquis. Xarelto sales fell 9.5% vs. the year-earlier period.As a silver lining, J&J reported 56.7% year-over-year growth for Imbruvica, a cancer drug in partnership with AbbVie. The companies are now looking to have Imbruvica approved to treat patients suffering from graft-versus-host disease — which can occur when foreign tissue is introduced into the body via organ transplants.RELATED:Dow's Johnson & Johnson Sets Up Lackluster Results For SectorCan Lilly Survive Rheumatoid Arthritis Flop With Breast Cancer Drug?

351,CELG,"Just as an ace baseball pitcher mixes his throws, top mutual fund managers vary their investments. Managers of Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund are mingling semiconductor stocks with biotech stocks, online travel agencies and a Chinese fast-food chain, all to good effect. That's been a benefit to investors with retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $3.3 billion fund is working its way back toward its multiyear top-notch outperformance. This year going into Wednesday, the fund's 8.97% gain topped 62% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the 5.75% advance by the S&P 500.That's an improvement over its showing during the past 12 months, when the fund outpaced just 54% of its direct rivals with a nonetheless decent 15.49% rise. So its year-to-date relative performance is a turn back toward what it accomplished over the past three years, when it beat 89% of its direct rivals.A key piece of credit goes to the fund's stake in technology stocks, which was the portfolio's largest sector as of Feb. 28 with a 34% weighting, nearly double the second-largest sector then, consumer discretionary. The S&P 500 has a tech weighting of 20%.The fund's semiconductor stocks include Lam Research (LRCX), up 19% so far this year; Micron Technology (MU), up 22% this year; and Broadcom (AVGO), up 18%.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Its 99 Composite Rating is the highest possible, and its earnings per share growth has accelerated for four quarters in a row. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Biotech bets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), up 56%, and Celgene (CELG), up 8%. Two of the fund's consumer discretionary plays are online travel agencies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), which are up 19% and 14% respectively this year.And China-based restaurant chain Yum China (YUMC) is another security to like in the consumer discretionary space, up 25% this year.They've also trying to make plays with multicategory straddlers Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN).Lam has benefited from two trends. One is the growing complexity in some semiconductors and their manufacturing equipment, says Peter Deininger, one of three managers of the fund. The second is consolidation in the semiconductor equipment space. That has cut inventory volatility, and smoothed out industry cycles. ""That means higher margins and higher returns for Lam,"" Deininger said.In addition, Lam is a leader in the etching and deposition segment of the semiconductor equipment field. ""That's helped them increase market share at a rate in excess of other players,"" Deininger said. ""Combined, all of this has put the company in a good situation, which we anticipate has legs to go.""Micron makes memory and data-storage devices. Its industry has gone through enough consolidation that pricing is stable to rising in Micron's key DRAM and NAND products, Deininger says. That leads to rising margins, he adds.Industrywide, with earnings and share prices doing so well last year, might the segment be near a top? That could explain the recent pullback in this space, which affected Micron among other stocks.But Deininger is not ready to retreat yet. ""There continues to be very balanced supply, pricing remains firm, and lead times for products are modestly extended,"" he said. ""Combined with a lack of significant new capacity, that argues that (share-price strength) should hold for some time going forward.""Fund manager Tchintcia Barros likes Vertex's existing treatments for cystic fibrosis as well as another in development. Vertex gapped up 20% on March 29 amid news about favorable results in a late-stage trial for that new treatment, a combination therapy. Vertex plans to add another drug to create a three-drug cocktail that could treat thousands more cystic fibrosis patients, Barros says.""Several months ago, a competitor (Galapagos) created some fears (among investors) around whether Vertex would have that portfolio of treatments to itself,"" Barros said. ""But data show that (Galapagos) is three years behind Vertex.""The fund's managers have mixed feelings about the consumer discretionary space. On the one hand, since the end of last year they have shifted to an underweight from an overweight in the sector vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index.They've sold out of positions in branded apparel manufacturer VF (VFC), yogawear chain store Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS). ""Online companies have put a lot of pressure on traditional retail areas,"" manager John Wilson said.On the other hand, the fund still likes online travel agencies Priceline and Expedia.And the managers like Yum China as a pure play on China restaurant stocks.Yum China gapped up 9% on April 6, the day it released first-quarter financial results. Earnings per share grew 19%. Despite a 1% slip in sales, sales nosed above the consensus estimate. The company opened 133 new stores in the quarter, including its Little Sheep and East Dawning outlets.In its guidance for fiscal 2017, the company said it would open at least 550 new stores and that operating profit would grow at a double-digit pace.Yum Brands (YUM) — which the fund also holds — said it had completed its spinoff of Yum China on Nov. 1, 2016. Since they began trading that day, shares in the new company are up 25%.RELATED: Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On These Stock LeadersYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

352,CELG,"Biotech investors will likely be keyed in on the launches of Biogen's (BIIB) Spinraza and Regeneron's (REGN) Dupixent as first-quarter results roll around, an analyst said Wednesday in a sector preview.IBD's 424-company biotech industry group is ranked No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 42 just 13 weeks ago. But the first quarter will be ""choppy"" amid inventory and seasonality challenges, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Wednesday.""Our analysis suggests that Q1 is not going to be a breakout or particularly impressive quarter for the large-cap names in our coverage universe, but neither is it going to be the disaster that the slowing results in Q4 might suggest,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Given the flux in shipping days and inventory levels, investors are likely to pay most attention to key launches already underway or anticipated for 2017.Biogen's spinal muscular atrophy drug with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is likely to be scrutinized amid recent payer pushback. Meanwhile, investors will be looking for commentary on how Roche's (RHHBY) multiple sclerosis drug, Ocrevus, might hurt Biogen's MS franchise. Celgene (CELG) is also working on an MS drug, ozanimod.Expectations are still high for Regeneron and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent, an eczema injection that launched at the end of the first quarter.""Initial feedback from the company and physicians after a month of commercialization will be critical to assess the launch sales trend, especially any anecdotes about the accessibility for patients after the price announcement,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead Sciences is suffering from a slowing hepatitis C drug franchise. Could it buy itself out of the decline? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a better look at what Gilead may have its sights on acquiring.Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron are also likely to get questions on reimbursement changes for their medicines that lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. Amgen showed in a recent study that lowering LDL cholesterol reduces the risk for heart attacks and strokes, and the Street is hoping that will push payers to reimburse for the drugs.In upcoming filings, investors will look for Amgen commentary on migraine drug erenumab and romosozumab, a drug to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is working on immunosuppressant Soliris in a neuromuscular disease. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is testing its tezacaftor in cystic fibrosis.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is likely to comment on its HIV drug, bictegravir. Gilead is pushing its HIV drugs as a potential replacement for declining sales of hepatitis C drugs. The company's hepatitis C unit raked in north of $44 million in three years before falling in 2016.RELATED:Will Gilead's HIV Franchise Plan Be Dashed On TrumpCare?How Gilead Is Paying The Price For Actually Curing A DiseaseBiotech ETFs Defy Trump Tweets To Rally, But What Can Send Them Higher?

354,CELG,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

356,CELG,"The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials all rose slightly Thursday, with more stocks setting up new possible entries within sound bases. Here are six big-cap stocks that are within 1% of buy points: Amgen (AMGN), General Motors (GM), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), ASML (ASML) and PNC Financial Services (PNC).XGeneral Motors has a $54 billion market cap, and that's the smallest of the six, with Visa No. 1 at $200 billion. Amgen, GM, Mastercard and ASML all edged past entry points intraday, but closed beneath them.The market uptrend is under pressure, with earnings season kicking into high gear. So investors should be especially cautious about taking on new positions now.Amgen rose 1% to 175.04 in Thursday stock market trading. The biotech's stock rose as high as 176.20, briefly passing a 175.55 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, but couldn't hold that level. Volume was below normal, though the highest in three weeks.Amgen hasn't been a market leader lately. Its relative strength line is well off recent highs, as Amgen lags the S&P 500 index. And several other biotechs, including Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN), have already broken out.General Motors rose as high as 36.12 Thursday afternoon, briefly passing a 36.10 cup-with-handle entry.

357,CELG,"The biotech industry, always a highly technical conundrum for investors, might currently pose an even greater challenge — and offer even greater opportunities — than usual. Early industry innovators like Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) currently find themselves in ""big trouble,"" according to Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar, largely as victims of their own success. But cancer…

358,CELG,"Wall Street remained bullish Tuesday on Merck (MRK) even though the Dow drugmaker suspended enrollment in a pair of cancer trials, noting more patients died in the group that used its Keytruda medication than those in other groups.Merck said late Monday it's pausing enrollment in two trials of Keytruda, an immuno-oncology drug, combined with corticosteroid dexamethasone and either Pomalyst or Revlimid from Celgene (CELG), two chemotherapies.Both trials treated multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. Merck was looking at patients who had never been treated and patients whose cancer had either relapsed or hadn't responded to previous treatment.An independent committee recommended that Merck suspend enrollment in the trials after discovering more patients died using Keytruda than those in comparison groups. Merck said it's collecting more information.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Merck stock dipped 1% to finish the regular trading session at 63.27, after earlier falling as much as 2.1%. Shares of its biggest rival, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), were down marginally to 54.19.IBD'S TAKE: Keep tabs on the biotech and pharma industry by bookmarking IBD's Biotech Stocks To Watch And Pharma Industry News page.Company watchers likely aren't figuring much in multiple myeloma sales for Merck, UBS analyst Marc Goodman wrote in a note to clients. He estimates $50 million in risk-adjusted sales for Keytruda in multiple myeloma.""Importantly, Merck indicated that other studies of Keytruda continue unchanged,"" he said. ""We do not expect these issues in multiple myeloma to carry over to other studies, like the important Keytruda plus chemo combo in (advanced lung cancer).""Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note to clients it was inevitable at least one Keytruda combination out of 500 ongoing trials wouldn't work as expected. But he doesn't expect the pause in multiple myeloma to have a material impact on Merck.""To date, Keytruda has had a clean safety profile, and with the number of studies ongoing in very sick patient populations, it is reasonable to assume that a certain combination or indication could yield a negative safety result,"" he said.Divan kept his outperform rating and 72 price target on Merck stock. UBS' Goodman has a buy rating and 70 price target on shares of Merck.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted a prior 48-patient trial of Keytruda, dexamethasone and Celgene's Revlimid was very effective with 56% of patients showing some reduction in tumor size. There was no ""hint"" of safety issues from the prior study, he said.The bigger question is whether rival Bristol is seeing similar issues with its immuno-oncology drug Opdivo. Merck's combination was six months ahead of Bristol's, Raffat wrote in a note. So far there's no update in Bristol's trial.RELATED:Dow's J&J Hosted A Diabetes Study — And Lilly Will Benefit MostHere Are Winners And Losers From Year's Biggest Cancer MeetingDow's Merck 'Clearly Won' Vs.

359,CELG,"A slew of biotechs and drugmakers might take a closer look at Epizyme (EPZM) after the small-cap biotech presented strong data in a lymphoma trial Wednesday in Switzerland, an analyst said Thursday.The findings at the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma could attract the likes of Gilead Sciences (GILD), AbbVie (ABBV), Celgene (CELG), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) or Roche (RHHBY), Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.Epizyme is testing its drug, dubbed tazemetostat, in two forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Interim data show tazemetostat had a clinically meaningful benefit in all patients with what's called follicular lymphoma, a buildup on cells in the lymph nodes.Tumors shrunk in 92% of follicular lymphoma patients and in 29% of patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and a specific genetic mutation. Tazemetostat proved safe across all patient populations.Leerink's Porges called the study a ""proof of principle."" He expects the drug to win accelerated approval at the Food and Drug Administration in follicular lymphoma. Accelerated approvals allow a drug to be marketed while still in clinical trials.""Few cancer drugs have a 90% response rate, or a 100% clinical benefit rate, in any disease,"" he said. ""And while investors might debate about how big that group of patients really is, and how long treatment duration will be, we would not be surprised to see Epizyme start to show up on potential takeout candidate lists.""Epizyme could be appealing to AbbVie, Celgene, J&J and Roche, Porges wrote. Roche is among the leaders in immuno-oncology, a method of treating tumors by blocking certain interactions that hide cancer cells.Gilead is better known for its virology drugs, including those that target hepatitis C and HIV. But Gilead's hepatitis C franchise declined in 2016 amid high cure rates. Now, Gilead has said it's open to seeking an acquisition in oncology. Incyte and Tesaro are also rumored takeout candidates.""Now that the molecule (tazemetostat) has been de-risked, we expect more investors to get involved into the stock and to build positions ahead of further data disclosures,"" Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Seattle Genetics Chief Executive Clay Siegall says his company is aiming to change the 40-year method of treating Hodgkin lymphoma. How? Head to IBD's Technology page for an exclusive with the CEO.The same conference saw Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN) team up for a Phase 1/2 trial in classical Hodgkin lymphoma, also with robust results. But only Epizyme stock spiked on its news.Bristol-Myers and Seattle Genetics, too, had strong data in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Tumors shrunk in 85% of patients treated with a combination of Bristol's Opdivo and Seattle's Adcetris. All signs of cancer disappeared in 63% of patients. The combo proved safe as well, Bristol said.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Epizyme stock soared more than 13%, near 14. Shares have run up 34% over the past four days. Bristol-Myers stock, on the other hand, dipped less than 1% near 54.28. Seattle Genetics stock was flat, near 64.RELATED:Analyst Pleads With Gilead To Buy — And It May Have WorkedCould Seattle Genetics' Adcetris Grab 'Blockbuster Status' After 2017 Trial?Dow's Merck Pauses Cancer Trials To Investigate Keytruda-Tied Deaths

360,CELG,"Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stock rocketed to a 20-month high Tuesday on strong data presented Monday in a cancer trial with No. 2 biotech Celgene (CELG).Bluebird stock popped 14.9% to 104.90 in morning trading on the stock market today. It broke out of a consolidation period with a buy point of 100.50, but finished the regular session below that level. Bluebird rose 7.6% to 98.20 for the day in heavy trading. It was the stock's fourth day in a row of gains.On Monday, Bluebird said all 15 evaluable patients in a trial of its drug known as ""bb2121"" responded to treatment. Nearly all patients — 89% — saw their tumors shrink, and 27% saw all evidence of their tumors disappear.There has been no disease progression for patients in the ongoing trial as of May 4, the data cutoff.Bb2121 belongs to a class of drugs called chimeric antigen receptor T cells. In therapy using the drugs, certain immune system cells are removed from a patient and then modified to be able to recognize the cancer cells. They are then reintroduced to the patient.IBD'S TAKE: Bluebird and Celgene's data was presented during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. Also there, players like Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche presented data. But one analyst says Merck ""clearly won the battle."" Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at the setup in immuno-oncology treatments.During the Phase 1 trial, Bluebird and Celgene were looking to identify a safe dose to take into Phase 2 trials. So far they have found no dose-limiting toxicities for the drug, Bluebird said in a news release.Celgene stock dipped 1% to 116.88 on Tuesday.RELATED:

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.2%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index gave back 0.7%. Volume on the NYSE was higher than Tuesday's level while Nasdaq volume was lower, early figures showed.Economic data released before the open didn't do anything to strengthen the argument for more rate hikes. Consumer prices were tame, falling 0.1% vs. the consensus estimate for flat. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.1% vs. expectations for a 0.2% gain.Meanwhile, retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.3% in May, the worst drop since January 2016.

363,CELG,"A Food and Drug Administration panel unanimously voted to recommend for approval an experimental immuno-oncology treatment from Novartis (NVS), a panel attendee told Investor's Business Daily.Novartis' drug, known as CTL019, will go before the full FDA in early October, a spokesperson previously told IBD. If approved, it could pave the way for a similar drug from Kite Pharma (KITE), dubbed KTE-C19, to grab approval as well, says Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments.Loncar attended the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting where the panel agreed 10-0 that the benefits of CTL019 outweigh the risks in cancer treatment. CTL019 is being considered as a drug to treat pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a bone marrow cancer.""I don't think it's an embellishment to say that this is a historic day,"" he said. ""After the voters on the panel vote, they go around the table and explain their vote. One person said this is the most exciting thing he's ever seen in his entire life. And you don't hear things like that very often at FDA meetings.""Novartis' and Kite's drugs belong to a class of treatments called CAR-T therapies. To create these drugs, researchers extract immune system cells from a patient's blood. Using an ""empty"" virus, they affix what are known as chimeric antigen receptors to the immune system cells.IBD'S TAKE: Could the cure for some cancers be in your blood? It's possible, some biotechs and drugmakers say, with CAR-T therapies. Take a deep dive on the experimental drugs by visiting IBD's Technology page.Chimeric antigen receptors, or CAR, are proteins that can recognize the proteins that cancer cells use to hide in a patient's body. When the re-programmed immune system cells are reintroduced to the body, they are directed to seek out and destroy cancer cells.Largely, the FDA panel focused on safety in the morning before wrapping up late Wednesday, Loncar said.""The biggest issue with this is the purity of the cell,"" he said. ""When it's introduced back into the patient, they want to make sure it's 100% (immune system cell). It would be a disaster if you infuse a B-cell (a cancer cell) that causes someone to have cancer.""But that's never shown up in clinical trials, he noted. Most patients undergoing CAR-T therapy are doing so as a last resort following a number of treatment courses including chemotherapy and/or stem-cell transplants. CAR-T therapies are one-time treatments that are meant to be long-lasting.""With a long-term treatment, there's always long-term unknowns,"" he said. ""But these are such sick patients and the benefit of the drug is so black and white, it's so clear.""The FDA is scheduled to vote on whether to approve Kite's KTE-C19 in November. The drug is a treatment for an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a blood cancer. Further behind, Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE), in a partnership with Celgene (CELG), are also working on CAR-T drugs.Novartis closed up 1.5% to 83.21 on the stock market today, in buy range from an 82.04 entry. Novartis rose to 84.70 in late trading as the FDA panel news was confirmed.Kite Pharma climbed 0.9% to 104.65 at the close, rising slightly after hours.RELATED:Can Celgene, Bluebird Keep Their Lead As Rival Champ At The Bit?Novartis Faces Key FDA Panel On Cancer Drug; Why Kite Could Be The WinnerThis Small Biotech Soared On Its Celgene-Partnered Trial

364,CELG,"Celgene's (CELG) Revlimid will continue to carry the biotech even after losing patent exclusivity in 2026, an analyst said Friday, noting that the chemotherapy is ""one of the most adaptable oncologic 'mixers.' ""Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges called Revlimid the ""tonic water of oncology."" Revlimid is often combined with other cancer drugs to create a stronger treatment. The method has proven particularly robust in myeloma, a blood cancer.Porges upgraded Celgene stock to an outperform rating and boosted his price target to 150 from 146. On the stock market today, Celgene stock climbed 1.45% to 122.36.""Its synergy in combination with antibodies continues to surprise the research community, and the applications of this utility are only beginning to be realized,"" Porges wrote in a note to clients.Eventually, Revlimid could be combined with Roche's Rituxan, Porges said. Though the combination hasn't been proven in clinical trials, analysts expect it to have promise in treating lymphomas, a family of blood cancers in the lymph nodes.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts expect smaller oncology-centric biotechs to pull some interest this year on what's known as CAR-T treatments in a number of blood cancers. Head to the Industry Snapshot for the deep dive.""We forecast Revlimid will continue to grow in the mid-to-high teens through its patent life in 2022 and that the product will benefit from its (ability to combine) with most or all of the established and emerging biologics in the myeloma category,"" he said.Porges expects Revlimid sales to bring in $8.3 billion in 2017, which would then grow to $13.7 billion in 2020 before hitting a peak of $17.4 billion in 2022. Revlimid accounts for about 75% of Celgene's sales and 80% of its gross profit, he estimates.RELATED:Could This Small Biotech Pique Interest Of Gilead And Others?Can This Small Biotech Be Saved By Developing Anemia Drug?Dow's Merck Pauses Cancer Trials To Investigate Keytruda-Tied Deaths

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December.

Domino's Pizza (DPZ) crashed in part on disappointing Q2 international comps, lower margins, an EPS helped by the tax rate and an already-high stock valuation. Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled after fiscal-Q3 same-store sales and revenue missed; EPS matched views. The coffee chain said it would close all 379 Teavana retail stores.Several industrial Dow giants rolled past Q2 estimates Tuesday thanks in part to improved global growth. Caterpillar (CAT) surged to a 52-week high after the company saw EPS of $1.49, up 36.7%, on revenue of $11.33 billion, up 9.6%. United Technologies (UTX) saw earnings climb 1.6% to $1.85 per share on a 2.7% revenue rise to $15.28 billion. Shares tumbled to their lowest level since May despite raised full-year EPS and revenue guidance. DuPont (DD) also beat on the top and bottom lines. Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks. Fortinet shares tumbled.TAL Education (TAL) topped earnings and sales estimates, as per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $321.9 million came out ahead of forecasts for 28 cents and $307.8 million. For the current quarter, the China-based education company sees revenue of $428.4 million to $433.8 million, above views for $424.8 million, per Yahoo Finance estimates. Meanwhile, peer New Oriental Education (EDU) also pulled ahead of forecasts with 41 cents EPS and $486.4 million, in addition to a 36.9% bump in total student enrollments; the midpoint of Q1 revenue guidance pulled just ahead of current views. TAL and New Oriental shares rose 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively,  but the latter's breakout failed Thursday.Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue. Shares reversed modestly lower from a record high but remained in buy range.Baidu (BIDU) earnings rose 143%, well over views, while revenue climbed 14% to an in-line $3.08 billion.

367,CELG,"Biotech stocks toppled midday Thursday in line with broader indexes, and included pitfalls from large players like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), United Therapeutics (UTHR) and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) as long-term views look weak or uncertain.XOn the stock market today, Vertex dove 4.4% to 156.19; United Therapeutics fell 4.8% to 125.10; and Spark dipped 3.3% to 70.29. Broadly, IBD's 439-company biotech industry group lost 2.3%, reflecting major indexes that trended down.This followed beats from Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Vertex, Celgene (CELG) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) this week. All but Vertex increased some of their 2017 guidance. Vertex kept its full-year view, but sees a slowdown in the third quarter.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges trimmed his third-quarter views for Vertex and cut his 2017 sales forecast by 2%. He kept an outperform rating on Vertex but his price target on the stock got a haircut to 187 from 188.Second-quarter sales of cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco beat expectations. But Porges noted some of that was due to inventory stocking ahead of the anticipated summer slowdown. Vertex is also working on a triple-pill in cystic fibrosis.Outside its cystic fibrosis franchise, Vertex said on its earnings conference call that it could look to make small technology-based early-stage acquisitions, but will likely avoid ""the large-stage or large investments many investors fear,"" Porges said in a report.For United Therapeutics, second-quarter sales were the highest the company has ever seen at $445 million, ""but resumption of growth is not guaranteed,"" Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz said in a note to clients.United is working on drugs to treat a rare blood disease known as pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. Schwartz increased his third- and fourth-quarter sales models by 5%-7% after the strong second-quarter report.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. But mergers and acquisitions could send them higher with Vertex considered both a takeover target and an acquirer in some circles. Get the deep dive via IBD Industry Themes.""Due to lack of any curative therapy for PAH, providing a suite of PAH medicines could keep patients transitioning between United products,"" he said. ""However, we are reluctant to assume that a rebound in product sales this quarter will materialize resumption of growth trajectory in other United products.""Also Thursday, Alexion and Celgene topped expectations. Alexion rose 2.2% to 133.92, but Celgene still dipped 2.6% to 134.15.  Investors were likely looking for Celgene to raise its top-line guidance for 2017, but instead Celgene lifted its adjusted profits forecast for the year to $7.25-$7.35 a share.""The main surprise in this result is the lack of an increase in top-line guidance, which we would normally have expected at this time of year,"" Leerink's Porges said. ""Since the second quarter of 2010, this is only the their time that Celgene has not increased their revenue guidance in the second quarter.""Elsewhere in biotech, analysts were more bullish on Gilead which saw hepatitis C drug sales fall a collective 27.5% on slower revenue from Harvoni and Sovaldi. But that beat analysts' view, which predicted a fall of 32%, Porges said. He raised his price target to 83 from 74.The magnitude of the beat points to stabilizing hepatitis C drug sales, he said. But ""the windfall may be short-lived, however, as AbbVie's (ABBV) next-generation doublet is set to enter the market within weeks and is likely to represent the first real competition to Gilead's hepatitis C dominant market position.""RELATED:AstraZeneca Beats, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportThis Biotech Nearly Tripled Street Expectations For One Key DrugGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On Beat

368,CELG,"The major market indexes advanced higher in early trading Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and Dow Jones industrial average led the way, moving up 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher. All three indexes hit record highs.XAmong the Dow industrials, Verizon Communications (VZ), Merck (MRK), and Boeing (BA) all rose solidly in early trading. Verizon jumped nearly 6% after its Q2 results, but remains under its 200-day line. Merck looked to reclaim its 50-day line as it advanced over 3%. Early Thursday, biotech competitor AstraZeneca (AZN) reported a late-stage trial failure, causing its shares to plummet 16%.Meanwhile, Boeing added another 3% to Wednesday's near 10% earnings-related surge. The airplane maker is 30% above a 185.81 flat-base buy point.Longtime leading stock and FANG member Facebook (FB) surged 5% after topping top- and bottom-line estimates and beating views on ad revenue and user growth.Meanwhile, fellow social media companies Twitter (TWTR) and Snap (SNAP) traded mixed. Twitter reported Q2 earnings that beat the Street's estimates, but monthly active users were flat vs. Q1, sending shares down over 11%. Shares of Twitter had been on the comeback trail in recent months, rising almost 50% from their mid-April lows.Meanwhile, analyst firm Summit Redstone called the competition between Facebook and Snap ""no contest"" in Facebook's favor, due to Facebook's increasing pricing power with respect to ad prices. Shares of the Snapchat parent were trading about 53% off their post-IPO highs and almost 20% under the 17 IPO price, but traded 3.4% higher Thursday.Fellow FANG member Amazon.com (AMZN) will report its Q2 earnings after the bell Thursday. Analyst expect the e-commerce giant's quarterly profits to fall 20% year over year to $1.42 per share on a 22% rise in revenues to $37.2 billion. Shares advanced 1.2% in the stock market today and are over 4% above a 1016.60 flat-base entry.Casino operators took another hit early Thursday after mixed earnings results from MGM Resorts (MGM) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO). MGM fell nearly 3%, but is still holding above its 50-day line. Melco edged 0.3%, and is still below its 50-day line as it builds a new base.Within the IBD 50, PayPal (PYPL) jumped almost 3% — before paring its gain to 0.9% — after strong Q2 results late Wednesday. The leading payment processor is about 7% above a 55.24 flat-base entry.On the downside, Celgene (CELG) declined 1.3% despite beating Q2 estimates and lifting its full-year earnings guidance. The stock remains extended from its 127.74 flat-base buy point, about 6% above that level.RELATED:Facebook Vs.

371,CELG,"Axovant Sciences (AXON) and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) diverged in IBD's 424-company biotech industry group Monday as Axovant stock rode its chief executive swap to a 16-month high and OncoMed stock toppled on a failed drug trial.By the closing bell, on the stock market today, Axovant stock popped 22.5%, to 18.54, after announcing that former Medivation CEO David Hung would succeed Vivek Ramaswamy at the top job at Axovant. Ramaswamy will move up to lead Axovant parent Roivant Sciences.Hung's appointment was effective Friday. He headed up Medivation until its $14 billion acquisition by Pfizer (PFE) in September 2016. Ramaswamy said in a news release that Axovant hadn't initially been looking for a new CEO.""I approached David about taking a role with us after the Mindset study,"" he said, adding that ""David decided he wanted to join us now."" The Mindset study looks at Axovant's drug intepirdine in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patents; results are expected in September.Axovant stock busted out of a cup-with-handle formation that began in August 2016, passing a 15.90 entry point. Shares are now 24.8% extended from that buy point, touching a high last achieved in December 2015.Meanwhile, shares of OncoMed plunged to an all-time low after its drug, demcizumab, failed to extend progression-free survival in late-stage pancreatic cancer patients.OncoMed stock hit a record low, falling below 5 at one point during the session, and was down 36.6%, to 5.60, at the close.OncoMed's trial looked at a combination of demcizumab, gemcitabine and Abraxane. OncoMed also missed its second goal of improving overall survival. The trial compared demcizumab, gemcitabine — a chemotherapy first developed by Eli Lilly (LLY) — and Celgene (CELG) chemo Abraxane with gemcitabine and Abraxane plus a placebo.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's biotech industry group is ranked No. 4 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 56 just 13 weeks ago. Among biotechs, Celgene stock is the clear leader with an IBD Composite Rating of 99, out of a best-possible 99.

374,CELG,"XStocks tiptoed to modest gains in lighter trade on Thursday amid investors' multiple concerns that range from talks between President Trump and China's Xi Jinping, news that the Federal Reserve is getting ready to deleverage its monster balance sheet of debt, and the ongoing nuclear threat from North Korea.The Dow Jones industrial average edged up about 15 points, less than 0.1%, to 20,662. The Nasdaq composite outperformed, rising nearly 0.3%. The S&P 500 rose 0.2%.Small caps outperformed by a mile. The Russell 2000 gained 0.9%, helped in part by a rebound among smaller banks after the Federal Reserve signaled that it's getting more committed to a tighter monetary policy and lightening the debt load on its balance sheet later this year.These future monetary actions are likely to keep interest rates on an upward path, which could boost profit margins for many lenders. In March, the U.S. central bank pushed the fed funds rate up by 25 basis points to a target range of 0.75%-1%.Currently, the top 20 industry groups are dominated by the computer technology, finance, building and medical sectors.

The developer of therapies to battle cancers and immunological disease is trading tightly lately, but holding above a 122.49 buy point in a somewhat choppy cup base. That base formed after Celgene shares popped up big on Nov. 9, then stalled.Even during the Great Recession, demand for excellent medicines was so fierce that Celgene's revenue still grew 19% in 2009 and in the double digits every year since then.

377,CELG,"Chinese biotech BeiGene (BGNE) is the strongest beneficiary of Celgene's (CELG) $413 million gamble in immuno-oncology, an analyst said Friday as BeiGene stock touched a fresh high.Under the terms of the deal, BeiGene obtained the rights to commercialize Celgene's cancer drugs Abraxane, Revlimid, Vidaza and C-122 in China. C-122 is not yet approved, but is being tested in advanced solid tumors, blood cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges called the deal great news for BeiGene, but merely ""reasonable"" for Celgene. Celgene says its Chinese business brings in $65 million annually and, per the deal, it will retain half of the future Chinese profits on these drugs from BeiGene.""BeiGene goes from a development company to a commercial company overnight, at very little cost, in its home market, and has raised significant cash, and future development funding, for an asset that it would have struggled to develop and commercialize independently,"" he said.In return, Celgene acquired the rights to develop and commercialize BeiGene's immuno-oncology drug known as BGB-A317. The drug belongs to the same class as Keytruda from Dow's Merck (MRK) and Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs like Exelixis are working on treatments for advanced kidney cancer. But Exelixis is in a great position after retiring nearly all of its debt. Head to The New America for a breakdown on Exelixis stock.Celgene partnered with AstraZeneca (AZN) in April 2015 to develop and commercialize Imfinzi in blood cancers. Imfinzi is what's known as a PD-L1 inhibitor, which has a slightly different mechanism from Keytruda, Opdivo and BGB-A317, all PD-1 inhibitors.The deal with AstraZeneca doesn't give Celgene access to Imfinzi in solid tumors like lung, breast and ovarian cancers, among others.""Celgene appears to have concluded that to expand its portfolio in solid tumors in the future would require a PD-1 and its current agreement with AstraZeneca for (Imfinzi) excludes these indications (solid tumors),"" Porges wrote in a note to clients.Porges kept his outperform rating and 150 price target on Celgene stock. The timing of the deal with BeiGene looks ""either inspired or lucky,"" he said. It followed a day after Merck confirmed that the Food and Drug Administration had put three Keytruda trials on hold, citing patient deaths.Celgene shares ended the regular trading session Friday up 0.5% to 132.56.RELATED:Dow's Merck Stumbles After FDA Puts Keytruda Trials On HoldNovartis Faces Key FDA Panel On Cancer Drug; Why Kite Could Be The WinnerDeal May Help Celgene Rival Dow's Merck, Bristol In Cancer Drugs

378,CELG,"Kite Pharma (KITE) should benefit from a Food and Drug Administration panel hearing on an experimental cancer treatment from rival Novartis (NVS) later this month, an analyst said Thursday, though shares of both dropped.XOn the stock market today, shares of drugmakers working on what are called CAR-T therapies were broadly down. Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stock fell hardest, down 4.1% to close at 100.80. Kite stock lost 2.8% to 103.56, followed by shares of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), down 5.2% to 29.61 and Novartis, slipping 1.4% to 81.97.But Canaccord analyst John Newman remained bullish on Kite stock. Novartis, followed by Kite, are closest to having their CAR-T therapies approved in two blood cancers. On July 12, an FDA panel is set to review key questions surrounding Novartis' treatment.CAR-T therapies involve removing immune cells from a patient's blood and then programming them to seek out and destroy cancer cells. But some of these therapies have proven toxic to the nervous system. Meanwhile, the lag in turnaround time remains a sector-wide challenge, Newman said.Discussion regarding manufacturing for Novartis' drug, CTL019, should help differentiate Kite, Newman said. CAR-T therapies cannot be mass produced. Kite has an industry-leading turnaround time at 16-18 days vs. 22-29 days for Novartis and 24 days for Juno, according to various analyst reports.""Any discussion on manufacturing for Novartis CTL019 may highlight difficulties and benefit Kite, which has no had issues with failures and long turnaround times,"" he said, noting that the FDA could opt to discuss manufacturing directly with Novartis, potentially resulting in an approval delay.The FDA also is likely to focus on safety. Novartis' CTL019 hasn't shown the magnitude of deaths seen in Juno's discontinued JCAR015 in adult acute lymphocytic leukemia, a cancer affecting the bone marrow. Five of Juno's adult patients died as a result of brain hemorrhages.""However, we believe FDA will utilize the panel to focus on physicians' thoughts regarding severe neurotoxicity sometimes seen with CAR-T, especially on long-term effects,"" Newman wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: CAR-T therapies could help spike biotech stocks, analysts have said. Cancer and rare disease specialists have gained handsomely this year as early innovators like Amgen, Biogen and Gilead Sciences have struggled. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at why.In one trial, 48 out of 51 patients on Novartis' drug experienced what's called cytokine release syndrome, a common side effect of CAR-T therapy that results in a high fever. Of those cases, 66% were mild to moderate, 24% were moderate to severe and 4% were serious, resulting in death.More than a quarter, 27%, developed a brain disease altering structure or function, but all had a complete neurological recovery with no long-term issues, Newman said. Three adult patients died in the first 30 days following treatment with CTL019, all with serious cases of cytokine release syndrome with one resulting in a brain hemorrhage.""We believe that FDA and the panel will conclude that most cases of cytokine release syndrome occurring for CAR-T therapies can be managed, but that intracranial hemorrhage will be discussed,"" Newman wrote.Novartis currently is expected to have an approval date in late September to treat the blood cancer known as acute lymphocytic leukemia in children and young adults. Kite's drug, KTE-C19, is expected to be approved to treat a form of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, another blood cancer, in late November.Meanwhile, Bluebird Bio and partner Celgene (CELG) are working on a drug to treat another blood cancer called multiple myeloma. In a trial presented in June, Bluebird and Celgene's drug known as bb2121 achieved an overall response rate of 89% in multiple myeloma patients.Analysts have estimated that the duo is about a year ahead in using an immuno-oncology target called BCMA. Bb2121 works to block immune system interactions involving the BCMA antigen. But it's likely that the drug won't get the FDA OK until 2018 or later, analysts have said.Canaccord's Newman kept his buy rating and 115 price target on Kite stock.RELATED:Can Celgene, Bluebird Keep Their Lead As Rivals Champ At The Bit?The Cure For Cancer?

379,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) could rival Dow component Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) in cancer-fighting drugs, an analyst said after the No. 2 biotech announced a $413 million deal, giving it access to a key immuno-oncology treatment.XUnder the terms of the deal, Celgene will pay BeiGene (BGNE) $263 million in upfront license fees and make a $150 million equity investment to acquire the rights to develop the drug known as BGB-A317 in solid tumors across the globe.BGB-A317 belongs to a class of immuno-oncology drugs called PD-1 inhibitors. These drugs, including Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo, work to block a specific interaction involving the PD-1 protein in body that would prevent an immune response to cancer cells.The deals allows Celgene to develop and commercialize BGB-A317 to treat solid tumors in the U.S., Europe, Japan and the rest of the world outside of Asia. BeiGene keeps the rights to its drug for blood cancers worldwide and for solid tumors in Asia.Celgene already has an immuno-oncology play in blood cancers with its acquisition of the rights to AstraZeneca's (AZN) Imfinzi in hematological tumors in 2015, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. He called the deal a small upfront cost to get access to a PD-1 inhibitor beginning trials next year.Also within the deal, BeiGene will acquire Celgene's commercial operations in China and an exclusive license to commercialize cancer drugs Abraxane, Revlimid and Vidaza in China, Celgene said in a news release early Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Several drugmakers are working to create CAR-T therapies, an individualized form of immuno-oncology, in which the immune system to reprogrammed to fight cancer. Who's leading the sector? Head to the Industry Snapshot.The deal comes a day after the Food and Drug Administration put three of Merck's Keytruda trials on hold after several patient deaths. Celgene was partnered in those trials. Still, questions linger regarding how much Celgene is willing to put in to finish development of BGB-A317, Raffat said.""From Celgene's perspective, (it's) very important to understand how big a (research and development) undertaking this will be and how many additional immuno-oncology targets it will look to bring in for potential combos,"" he wrote in a note to clients.A number of companies, Merck and Bristol included, are working to combine their immuno-oncology drugs with others to boost their potency. BeiGene, though, says its PD-1 inhibitor is more efficient because it's been engineered to minimize interactions with other targets outside the PD-1 protein.Celgene is working on a number of immuno-oncology targets outside of PD-1. But Raffat expects it will need to add more, including an IDO inhibitor like Incyte's (INCY) epacadostat or a CTLA-4 inhibitor like Bristol's Yervoy.On the stock market today, Celgene stock dipped nearly 1% to close at 131.95. Shares of Merck fell 1.7% to 63.10, as Bristol-Myers stock slid 1.9% to finish at 55.28. BeiGene stock, though, rocketed 26.8% to end the regular session at 66.28, a record close. Intraday, BeiGene hit a record high of 68.67.RELATED:Dow's Merck Stumbles After FDA Puts Keytruda Trials On HoldBristol Beats Itself in Cancer Test; Can It Conquer Dow's Merck?The Cure For Cancer?

Tesla's Model S did not receive the highest IIHS safety rating. Wednesday's loss sent shares tumbling below their 10-week line of support, tripping a sell signal and trimming its gain above a 313.83 buy point to 4%.Earnings results reported late Wednesday sent PriceSmart (PSMT) down 9% and Yum China (YUMC) 10% lower. Electrical components maker AZZ (AZZ) dived 7% after reporting a broad first-quarter miss early Thursday.China's BeiGene (BGNE) spiked 30% at the open, after announcing a strategic partnership with Celgene (CELG) to develop immuno-oncology compounds targeting solid tumors.

The company now sees revenue of $15.4 million, up from prior guidance of $12.1 million.

Volume on the Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Wednesday's levels. NYSE volume was slightly lower.The so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — followed the Nasdaq's path, overcoming early weakness. Facebook and Netflix showed mild losses while Amazon and Alphabet edged higher.Generic drug makers and retail-related groups lagged, while metal ore, steel and foreign banks stocks outperformed.Investors sold bonds again Thursday, lifting the 10-year Treasury yield higher by 5 basis points to 2.38%. The bond market seems convinced about higher rates going forward, but traders of Fed Funds futures aren't so sure. The market currently thinks there's a 47% chance the Fed will hike rates one more time this year, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.Benchmark crude oil added just over 2%, to $46.18 a barrel, after the Energy Information Administration reported a 6.3 million barrel drop in crude inventories, catching analysts by surprise. This echoed a report late Wednesday from the American Petroleum Institute that also showed an unexpectedly sharp decline in oil inventories.In M&A news, Home Shopping Network (HSNI) surged 27% on news it's being acquired by QVC Group (QVCA) for just over $2 billion. QVC reversed lower, falling less than 1%.In the stock market today, Costco (COST) outperformed, rising 0.6%, after the company reported a 6% rise in June same-store sales.

382,CELG,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turn higher Friday after the Nasdaq composite closed Thursday below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell back below their 50-day lines, joining Apple, Netflix and many others. Some stocks, such as Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), are holding support. But they are fighting against the tide.Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value after falling for much of the overnight session. Futures for the S&P 500 advanced 0.4% and Dow futures climbed 0.35%. Crude futures rose nearly 1% after gaining for several days in a row.XThis year's broad tech rally was fueled by several big trends: FANG+ (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet, plus Apple), China internets, chipmakers, optical gear plays and, more recently, enterprise software firms.But more and more stocks are breaking 50-day lines or round-tripping on breakouts.Apple tumbled below its 50-day moving average on June 10 and hasn't found a way back. Even with recent struggles, including Thursday's 1.5% loss, Apple is still up 24% in 2017, the third-best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average.Microsoft and Alphabet on Tuesday closed just below their 50-day lines and bounced back on Wednesday. On Thursday, both Microsoft and Google's parent fell more decisively below that key support line. Microsoft and Alphabet are among the biggest cloud-computing rivals to much-larger Amazon Web Services.IBD'S TAKE: The market direction is still uptrend under pressure, which means investors should be cautious about taking new positions and ready to take profits and cut losses quickly. Pay attention to the leading stocks and major averages and read The Big Picture daily.Facebook traded below its 50-day line intraday for the fifth time in June, but once again closed above that line. Facebook announced this week that it has topped two billion monthly users. What makes that even more amazing is that the social giant is blocked in China, the world's largest internet market.Amazon has pulled back toward its 50-day line but has found support so far. Amazon continues to roil the retail, apparel and broader consumer fields, with Nike (NKE) confirming in its Thursday night earnings call that it will sell some shoes directly via the e-commerce giant.Weibo (WB) and Momo (MOMO) have fallen below their 50-day lines. NetEase (NTES) is once again round-tripping its late-stage breakout. And Tencent (TCEHY) pulled back into its three-weeks-tight pattern.But Alibaba (BABA) remains strong, and YY (YY) found support above its 50-day and is still in buy range.IBD's semiconductor manufacturing and semiconductor fabless groups have fallen below their 50-day moving averages, a few days after the chip equipment group undercut that level.Apple iPhone chipmakers in particular are struggling. Broadcom (AVGO) finally fell below its 50-day line on Thursday after several other Apple chip plays did the same, including Skyworks (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Analog Devices (ADI).A slew of top-rated chip equipment makers, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), are below their 50-day lines.Nvidia (NVDA) remains a standout.Fiber-optic stocks have been volatile leaders over the past year, as internet giants ramp up data centers, China beefs up infrastructure and Verizon (VZ) expands its high-speed metro broadband networks.But the Telecom-Fiber Optic group has fallen through its 50-day line. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), one of the hottest stocks in the group, is finding resistance there this week. Lumentum (LITE), which is seen as a possible Apple iPhone 3D sensor play, is close to round-tripping.Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) and SAP (SAP) are all below their 50-day moving averages.Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE), which both had strong earnings last week, are holding up well so far.While many techs are weak, financials are making gains, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) a notable breakout this week. Big banks announced huge dividend hikes and stock buybacks late Wednesday after passing the second round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. Meanwhile, higher Treasury yields, while a negative for the broader stock market (and housing stocks in particular), also are giving a lift to financials.Meanwhile, biotechs have been big winners in June. Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN) are two big-name breakouts, but there have been others.Defense and aerospace firms like Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) have held up well, either within buy range or just extended.In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.9% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 1.7% but China's Shanghai composite rose 0.1% 0.2%.

"
383,CELG,"Futures for the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial averages were mixed Wednesday morning, with big techs continuing to slide. That came after a slew of top-rated techs — including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Netflix (NFLX) — undercut their 50-day moving averages Tuesday, joining recent laggard Apple (AAPL).X As for the major averages, the Nasdaq composite fell 1.6%, the S&P 500 index 0.8% and the Dow industrials 0.5% on Tuesday.The heavy selling among leading stocks and major averages triggered a shift in market direction to ""uptrend under pressure."" The market came under pressure earlier this month, when Apple and other big techs sold off on June 9-10. But most leading techs, Apple being a notable exception, found support above their 50-day lines. On Tuesday, Alphabet fell below that level for the first time since April. Microsoft closed below its 50-day for the first time in seven months. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 hadn't finished below that support zone since early December.Facebook (FB), which announced that it now has more than two billion monthly users, did manage to hold above its 50-day line. So did Amazon (AMZN), the final member of FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet) and an IBD Leaderboard stock.Futures for the Dow industrials rose 0.25% above fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3%. But Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%, as big techs continue to lag. Apple, along with Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet, were fractionally lower. Amazon edged up.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to predict where the market is going; listen to the market. Pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks and read The Big Picture every day for timely, time-tested analysis.A brief sojourn below the 50-day line is not always fatal. But the sheer number of highly rated stocks — from Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) to Coherent (COHR) to Lam Research (LRCX) — that have cut through that level is worrisome.More than half of the IBD 50 fell 2% or more on Tuesday. True market leaders tend to fall about twice as much as the major averages in a correction.Still, it isn't all gloom. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) advanced 0.9% to 88.05, moving toward a buy point. Fed chief Janet Yellen said Tuesday that she doesn't expect another huge financial crisis ""in our lifetime."" That's a good sign going into U.S. banks' second round of stress tests due Wednesday evening. The Fed is expected to approve dividends and buybacks for many big banks.Meanwhile, biotech stocks pulled back Tuesday, but have largely held on to their recent big gains. Celgene (CELG) fell 2.2% but is comfortably in buy range.In the current environment, investors should be very cautious about making new purchases and be ready to take partial or full profits. Follow the action of the major averages and leading stocks.Even if you ignore the broader market, the broader market won't ignore you. If the market continues to weaken, your stocks will trip sell signals of their own.Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5% Wednesday.

It's now formed and broken out of three bases over the past 10 months, with 4% gains between each.The $13.5 billion fund, which tracks the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, has underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 year to date and over the past three years. It returned 7.5% vs. the S&P 500's 9.8% this year through June 22, according to Morningstar Inc., and a three-year average of 8% vs. 9.7%. But it's slightly outpaced the S&P 500 over the past five and 10 years.Top sector weightings include consumer cyclicals, about 16%, financial services and industrials at 14% each, 13% in health care and 12% in technology.Its top holding, Whole Foods Market (WFM), soared 29% on June 16 after Amazon announced it's buying the natural foods grocery chain for $13.7 billion. Biotech Celgene, which surged 10% last week, was another top name.The expense ratio is 0.40%.Schwab U.S. Broad Market (SCHB) climbed past a 58.26 entry of a flat base May 25 and has stayed in buy range since. The fund, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, has attracted $9.1 billion since its December 2009 launch.SCHB has returned 9.2% for the year through June 22, an average annual 9.2% the past three years and an average annual 15.1% the past five years vs. the S&P 500's 9.8%, 9.7% and 15.2% for those respective periods. The expense ratio is 0.03%.Technology, nearly 20%, accounted for the biggest sector weighting, followed by financial services 16%, health care 14%, consumer cyclicals 12% and industrials 11%.

387,CELG,"With names like AbbVie (ABBV) and Celgene (CELG) on a tear the past week, many biotech sector ETFs hit 52-week or longer highs.On Friday, they took a breather but retained the bulk of their big weekly gains. Most biotech funds are extended from their buy points, but several are still in or have pulled back into their respective buy zones.For instance, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), which rose as much as 6.5% from its 303.84 entry, eased Friday and is near the top of its buy range. The $9.4 billion fund has rallied 19% this year through June 21, according to Morningstar Inc. That's well above the S&P 500's slight one-week decline and 10% YTD return for the same period.BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC), up 31% YTD, is in buy range from a 24.31 cup-base entry. The $24.5 million fund is thinly traded with an average daily volume of about 12,000 shares.VanEck Vectors Biotech (BBH), up nearly 20% for the year, was waffling near the top of the 5% buy zone from 123.25 entry. The 5-year-old fund has attracted $702.3 million in assets.Analysts attributed the rally to subsiding drug-price concerns. Could there be further growth ahead?""CFRA is positive fundamentally on the biotech industry and sees strong revenue growth in 2017 aided by a robust pipeline,"" Todd Rosenbluth, Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research at CFRA, told IBD via email. ""We have buy recommendations on ABBV, Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), CELG and Gilead Sciences (GILD).""Those stocks all fall in the big-cap category, with market caps north of $16 billion.""We are more favorable on larger-cap biotechs and as such think IBB offers the best exposure to these stocks,"" he said. ""(Some) other ETFs offer more stock diversification and smaller cap exposure, which provides potential rewards, but also additional risk.""Leveraged ETFs, which try to magnify returns by doubling or tripling their benchmark index each day, posted double-digit gains in the week ended June 21. For instance, Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3X (LABU), which seeks investment results triple the performance of the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index, led with a 26% return, bringing its year-to-date haul to 113.9%.ProShares UltraPro Nasdaq Biotechnology (UBIO), which aims for three times the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index's daily performance, rallied 20.8% on the week for a 60.4% YTD return. ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology (BIB) scored a 13.7% gain for a 17.9% YTD return.All three are well extended. While such leveraged plays can make for big gains when the going is good, they tend to carry higher risk than most traditional biotech sector funds.On the other end of the spectrum are inverse ETFs, which are designed to give the opposite performance of the index they track. These funds provide a result similar to shorting the stocks in the index. The four shown in the accompanying chart have seen losses as biotechs have rallied. But they'd likely outperform if the sector heads south.""We don't have a view on leveraged and inverse ETFs other than that investors can easily get hurt if they hold on to them too long,"" Rosenbluth said. ""The risks are compounded much faster than investors can appreciate.""RELATED:Can Biotech Stocks Keep Their New Lead?This Top Biotech Stock Remains Just Within Buy Range

390,CELG,"Chinese internet and top-rated medical plays showed strength amid a dull showing by major indexes in late-afternoon trading Monday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite gained more upside in the final half hour of trading, rising 0.5%, and Apple (AAPL) looked poised to post a sixth straight session on the north side of the 50-day moving average.X The action by Apple is critical, not only to the stock but the greater market, given Apple's heft. The iPhone and iPad giant has a market cap of $790 billion. And the recent action represents an opportunity to buy shares near 149 as the stock stages its second follow-on entry point after breaking out of a bottoming-base pattern Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.The first follow-on entry came in late March as Apple surpassed a 3-weeks-tight pattern at 141.12, justifying the addition of a small number of shares to an already profitable core position in the stock.The 118.12 entry comes from adding 10 cents to the handle's high in a cup-with-handle base that formed from Oct. 11 through Jan. 5 of this year. After the Jan. 6-9 breakout, Apple has gained as much as 32.5%, triggering a key IBD rule to sell at least a partial position of shares when the gain hits 20% to 25%.Apple, featured in IBD's Stock Market Today column last week as it retook the 50-day line, gained 1.4% to 152.32, helping the Nasdaq composite edge more than 0.4% higher. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.3% and tacked on a new all-time high.The S&P 500 is up fractionally and is trying to avoid a third straight decline, giving up a trifling 0.1% over that time frame. The Dow Jones industrials slipped less than 0.2%, hurt by losses of 1 point or more in at least four of the 30 components, including Home Depot (HD) (falling further below the 50-day moving average, a sell signal for recent new holders), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) (down 1.7% to 133.01, but holding above the 50-day line and up 3.5% from a 128.47 cup-with-handle buy point) and Goldman Sachs (GS) (building a new potential saucer pattern, still up significantly from an October breakout past 172.52).The Russell 2000 eked out a small gain, up nearly 0.2%. Volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq and sharply slower on the NYSE vs. the same time in the prior session.Chinese consumer and e-commerce plays continued to surge, even as the Hong Kong and mainland China equity markets were closed for a holiday.Baidu (BIDU)'s breakout past a 193.84 buy point is gaining more momentum as the stock rallied nearly 3% to 198.72.

392,CELG,"Wall Street is concerned a delay at the Food and Drug Administration could expose Amag Pharmaceuticals (AMAG) to generic competition for a drug meant to prevent preterm birth, but the company's stock overcame a deficit by the close Monday.X The FDA said Monday it will take 10 months to review Amag's quick-shot version of its drug Makena. Makena is already approved as an intramuscular injection to prevent premature birth in pregnant women who've already delivered a preterm baby.Previously, the FDA had said it would review the auto-injector version of Makena over six months, giving Amag nearly four months to switch patients to the new iteration. Now, generic competition is set to gouge Amag in 2018.The company earlier guided to $410 million to $440 million in 2017 sales of Makena. Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz now models a 35% year-over-year decrease in sales of Makena.""Today's announcement of a 10-month regulatory review puts the Makena franchise at risk of losing market share,"" Schwartz wrote in a note to clients. He kept his market perform rating on Amag stock.Amag was granted ""orphan drug"" exclusivity for its first-generation Makena. But that exclusivity expires Feb. 3. Meanwhile, the FDA's review of the newest Makena puts its approval date at Feb. 14.In midday trading on the stock market today, Amag stock fell as much as 4.6%, though it pared those losses and finished the day unchanged at 18.35. Shares have traded well below their 50-day moving average since early May.IBD'S TAKE: Amag Pharma stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 27, meaning it underperforms about three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It trails Celgene (CELG) stock, which is ranked first in the biotech group with a best-possible CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for the most actionable players.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich noted Amag previously switched 70% of its patients to a preservative-free version of Makena over an eight-month period. Without sufficient time to switch patients, it's possible Amag could have to cut its expectations for 2018.Needham analyst Serge Belanger notes the development of the auto-injector has been ""anything but smooth.""In early January, Amag had to discontinue a trial when it showed patients experienced more pain with the auto-injector vs. the current version. In February, the new version of Makena missed a key chemical goal required by the FDA.RELATED:Amag Pharma Up On Pre-Eclampsia Drug Potential; Stock On Four-Day Run

393,CELG,"These are salad days for the biotech sector, as a number of industry leaders are hitting new highs and the group as a whole is near the top of its game in terms of stock performance.XStock inflows hit $1.6 billion over the last four weeks, and there have been a number of clinical trial successes and a new industry-friendly Food and Drug Administration regime is in place.As a result, Investors Business Daily's 439-company Biotech industry group has clawed its way to No. 4 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD from sixth just last week. Shares look likely to close at an 18-month high on the stock market today. And that's before a slew of earnings next week.""Just about everything that could be going right for biotech lately has been going right,"" Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, told IBD on Friday. The onslaught of biotech earnings next week could really give investors some fodder, he said.But there's one thing missing, says Loncar: mergers and acquisitions.""If that last piece fits into the puzzle, then the biotech sector could really be cooking with gas,"" he said.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is the likely linchpin. Loncar calls Gilead the ""poster child"" for a large biotech that needs to do a deal. In 2016, Gilead's multibillion-dollar hepatitis C drug franchise toppled for the first time. Now, Gilead says it's interested in a deal in the cancer space.Though some analysts have keyed in on Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) as a smart acquisition, Loncar sees Gilead as more likely to buy an early cancer asset — something it can develop and commercialize, rather than putting its money to work on buying a developed revenue stream.Vertex is already a hugely successful biotech in its own right, he said. Earlier this year, Vertex delivered the best news this year in the space, he pointed out. It had ""exceptional results"" in Phase 1 and 2 trials looking at a triple-pill to treat cystic fibrosis. The stock gapped up nearly 21% on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Rare disease and cancer plays have been front and center in the biotech sector as of late. Could these cutting-edge firms keep the rally going? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a deeper dive.""That's a multibillion-dollar stock,"" Loncar said. ""When a company like Vertex goes up 20%, that's something everybody in the stock market notices.""Gilead is set to report its second-quarter earnings Wednesday. But it will be sandwiched among a slew of strong contenders in the biotech space including Celgene (CELG), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN).No. 1 biotech Celgene is slated to report its second-quarter earnings before the open Thursday. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, leading its 438 peers and is sitting at a high last seen in July 2015.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Celgene and Alexion will be bellwethers for the group this time, in the same way Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is often seen as a proxy for the pharmaceutical group. He calls for Celgene to beat and raise, and for Alexion to rise by topping low views.Alexion is slated for Thursday. On Tuesday, Amgen could overtake a four-month high and jump to a record high if its second-quarter earnings report proves strong. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle on July 13 at a 175.55 buy point and still remain in a buy zone.This trio could help catapult the sector, analysts say. Meanwhile, on the pharma side, investors will key in to AstraZeneca (AZN) early Thursday. In recent weeks rumors have emerged that Chief Executive Pascal Soriot could jump ship for Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Loncar notes that the timing of those rumors were bad for AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca is set ""any day now"" to report the results of an immuno-oncology combination trial in lung cancer. Lung cancer treatment is a huge commercial opportunity and AstraZeneca is taking on players like Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).""Regardless of these rumors and controversy, I do think it's not an overstatement to say Pascal Soriot's job is on the line with (the trial) because this is make or break for AstraZeneca,"" he said. ""This study is the most important thing for AstraZeneca in the last 10 years.""Though biotech stocks are up 22.5% for the year, there's still room to run, CFRA Research analyst Jeffrey Loo told Investor's Business Daily. Valuations hit historic lows in 2016 amid the presidential election, and are still below both the S&P 500 and the overall health care sector.""Relative to historical valuations, the biotech sector is still attractively priced,"" he said.In late June, the sector got a massive push after President Donald Trump released a draft proposal on drug pricing. The initiative didn't include much to really tug down on drug prices, Loo said. He didn't credit the entire gain to the proposal, but it certainly helped, Loo said.Clinical trials, near-term FDA approvals and strong launch trends have also helped prod the sector this year including the cystic fibrosis news from Vertex, a gene therapy from Novartis (NVS) and a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug from Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT).On the latter development, Loncar says Sarepta's $13 million second-quarter sales beat for Exondys 51 could bode well for the broader sector. Sarepta also raised guidance for the year which most analysts have called conservative.""Everybody was watching that for a sign as to how drug launches are going and how payors are pushing back on things,"" he said. ""The fact the launch (of Exondys 51) is going well is a good sign not just for Sarepta, but for all biotech companies.""RELATED:Biotechs Find Strength In Numbers In Treating Multiple SclerosisToo Late To Catch Biotech Rally As Trump Fears Subside?Biotech Rally Gets Second Wind As This Small Cap Nears Break OutWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

394,CELG,"XU.S. stock indexes scored weekly gains, as two big-name biotechs, Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG), popped roughly 10% each for the week. The Nasdaq advanced 0.5% Friday, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was flat. Volume was running lower most of the session, but at the close the Russell reconstitution…
"
395,CELG,"Apple (AAPL) continued to prove its rally from a bottoming base breakout in both October last year and in January may not be over yet, while biotechs and select chip stocks helped sustain the rebound in U.S. stocks Wednesday.The Nasdaq composite rallied more than 1.1% as of 2:30 p.m. ET, outperforming gains of 0.8% by the S&P 500 and 0.7% by the Dow Jones industrial average. Small caps are doing even better; the S&P SmallCap 600 gained 1.5%.X Turnover is running mildly lower vs. the same time Tuesday on both main exchanges. As noted in the latest Big Picture column, IBD downgraded the outlook on the market to ""Uptrend under pressure"" due to the sell-off on the Nasdaq in higher volume on Tuesday, known as distribution. A flurry of big distribution days is enough to halt a bull-market advance and even turn it into a bear market.Despite the lower turnover with less than two hours remaining in the stock market today, volume has been above average in all but one of the past 14 trading sessions for the Nasdaq.Banking stocks, meanwhile, resumed their advance following comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen that appeared to indicate that another hike in short-term interest rates is in the cards for the rest of the year. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury benchmark bond edged to around 2.23%, the highest since May 29. WTI crude oil futures added more than 1% to $44.78 a barrel. Silver futures rose 1.1% while gold edged fractionally higher to nearly $1,250 a troy ounce on the Comex.Apple, up nearly 1.5% to 145.85, is still holding on to a large portion of its gain since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from an excellent cup with handle. That base furnished a 118.12 buy point, 10 cents above the handle's high of 118.02. Apple then gained as much as 32.5% in the space of just four months.A further rebound by the iPhone giant would produce a new buy point if shares were to hop back above the 50-day moving average, currently near 149. Watch to see if the stock can retake that line.The Street sees Apple's sales rebounding 5% to $226.6 billion in the current fiscal year ending in September, following a rare 8% slide in FY 2016. Profit is expected to climb 8% to $8.94 a share. Apple holds a 1.8% annualized dividend yield.IBD's TAKE: While Apple is getting a boost on the top line in recent quarters due to strong demand for its services, some observers question whether Apple will need to make an acquisition to fuel continued revenue gains in that area of business and fulfill its goal of doubling that business by 2020. Read IBD's latest tech team coverage on this increasingly vital part of Apple's business model. As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating continues to be positive at 84, meaning it's now beating 84% of all publicly traded companies in terms of 12-month relative price performance.Meanwhile, the biotech industry group is showing that it's not intending to backtrack from a leadership position in the stock market today. Some of this large industry group's biggest names, Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), are all behaving well and all three are trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, a sign of strength.Celgene, up more than 2% to 134.11, is wiping away losses from the prior two sessions. It broke out of a cup base with a 127.74 buy point last week. The 5% chase zone goes up to 134.12.Celgene sports a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, a 98 for Earnings Per Share Rating, and an A+ for Accumulation/Distribution, which means that over the past 13 weeks, the stock has shown evidence of heavy share accumulation by mutual funds, banks, insurers, pensions and the like.Regeneron and Vertex are extended for now, but could provide follow-on buy points in the future. Watch for mild pullbacks to the 50-day or 10-week moving averages. Make sure that IBD's current outlook is showing either ""Confirmed uptrend"" or ""Uptrend under pressure,"" signifying the odds of making money on a breakout are higher.Vertex, up more than 1% to 131.05, is now extended more than 7% past a recent breakout past a 122.06 entry in a long, deep first-stage base, similar to that of a bottoming base pattern. In that base, Vertex crumbled 50.2%, creating a massive shakeout.In the chip sector, Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA) are also showing leadership-quality gains. The former is also finding continued support along its 50-day line after a recent flat-base breakout at 227.85.Nvidia (98 Composite, 98 EPS) is extended from a May 10 breakout at 121.02. It has yet to challenge holders with a test of the 50-day moving average, which has been climbing sharply for more than six weeks.The Street sees fiscal second-quarter earnings jumping 68% to 69 cents a share, which is very impressive in light of the fact that Nvidia scored a 720% increase in adjusted EPS in the year-ago quarter, according to research by William O'Neil + Co.RELATED:How To Buy And When To Sell: The Latest In Investor's CornerWhen Did The Current Market Outlook Go To 'Uptrend Under Pressure'?

396,CELG,"Two stocks in buy range — Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NVS) and Dow industrials component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) — both reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings early Tuesday.XNovartis earned $1.22 a share excluding various items, down from $1.23 a year earlier. Sales fell 2% to $12.24 billion amid growing generic competition for cancer drug Gleevec. But the numbers were better than analyst forecasts for earnings of $1.16 a share and revenue of $12.1 billion.Excluding Gleevev/Gilvec, sales of cancer drugs rose 9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. Bone marrow stimulant Promacta/Revolade pulled in $210 million, up 35%. Sales of advanced melanoma and advanced lung cancer combination Tafinlar and Mekinist grew 28% to $216 million.Consentyx was another driver, growing 90%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, to $490 million, Novartis said in a news release. The drug is approved to treat plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammation of the spine and joints.Despite broadening competition in multiple sclerosis treatments that includes the likes of Biogen (BIIB), Roche (RHHBY) and Sanofi (SNY), Novartis' MS drug Gilenya brought in $837 million, up 5% excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. But Celgene (CELG) is now working on a drug that could directly rival Gilenya.Novartis' Alcon eye-care unit reported a small sales increase to $1.5 billion. Novartis raised its full-year Alcon sales target slightly, hinting at a possible spinoff for the division. Sales of contact lenses grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted in a report.On the stock market today, Novartis ended the day up 1.8% to 84.77. Novartis cleared an 82.04 cup-with-handle buy point last month. The 5% chase zone runs to 86.14.Johnson & Johnson, meanwhile, cleared a flat-base entry of 129.10 in early June. J&J stock rose 1.8% to finish Tuesday's regular session at 134.46, after the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.83 a share, up 28% vs. a year earlier and beating analyst views by 4 cents. Revenue was $18.84 billion, up slightly from a year earlier but just missing views of $18.9 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Small biotechs performed well over the past few weeks amid a biotech rally that saw the sector hit a 17-month high in June. Head to IBD's Technology page for a look at who looked strong in the pop.Worldwide pharma sales of $8.6 billion declined a fraction vs. the year-ago period, and missed for the third straight quarter, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro told clients in a note. U.S. drug sales dipped 2.6%, but 3.3% growth in sales outside the U.S. helped to partially offset that decline.Meanwhile, consumer and medical devices segments grew 1.7% and 4.9%, respectively. Though pharma sales missed Novarro's estimate by $170 million, revenues from J&J's consumer and medical devices units were in line with expectations.J&J sees full-year earnings of $7.12-$7.22 a share, with revenue of $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion. Analysts see earnings of $7.10 a share with revenue of $75.71 billion. Novarro says the guidance is likely taking advantage of favorable foreign exchange rates in the second half of the year.RELATED:How Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its RivalsNovartis Grabs Key FDA Panel Approval Of Experimental Cancer DrugNovartis Faces Key FDA Panel On Cancer Drug; Why Kite Could Be The WinnerUnitedHealth Set For Record High After Strong Earnings, Raised Full-Year TargetBank Of America, Goldman Sachs Earnings Top, But Trading Weak

397,CELG,"XShares of No. 2 biotech Celgene (CELG) broke out Wednesday after executive Patrick Flanigan characterized Celgene's identity as one of ""momentum and inflection"" during the Barclays Global Healthcare Conference in Miami.""The momentum in the business has been building over the last three to four years and is continuing into this year around our four key drivers,"" said Flanigan, Celgene's corporate vice president of investor relations.Flanigan noted strength in Celgene's Revlimid and Otezla drugs. Revlimid is an FDA-approved chemotherapy for several cancer types including multiple myeloma. In 2016, it brought in nearly $7 billion in sales, accounting for 62% of total product sales.Otezla is approved to treat plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Its worldwide sales grew 137.4% in 2016. Total sales for 2016 reached $305.1 million, growing by more than two-thirds vs. the prior year.IBD'S TAKE: IBD predicted Celgene's stock breakout last week. Head to IBD Stock Analysis for a take on the signs.Celgene expects to hit its 2017 targets and to either match or exceed its views for $21 billion in sales and $13 adjusted earnings per share in 2020. The next two years will be an inflection point for Celgene, Flanigan told conference attendees.Investors lapped up Celgene stock in the aftermath. Shares rose as high as 127.44 on the stock market today, breaking out of a four-month flat base with a 127.10 buy point. But the stock ended the day below that level at 126.88, up 1.8%.RELATED:Will Pfizer Take On Celgene, Other Rivals With Leukemia Drug?

398,CELG,"The major indexes mainly treaded water late in Tuesday's relatively quiet session. The Dow Jones industrial average, however, is showing bullish action by maintaining strength at its 50-day moving average.The Dow Jones industrials, enjoying strong gains by the likes of industrial giants Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX), edged up around 0.1% during a day of narrow-range trading. That's in contrast with Monday, in which the 30-stock blue-chip index fell to an intraday low of 20,517, but bounced higher after a challenge of support at the key 50-day moving average.The Dow showed an earlier test of strength at this intermediate-term support line on March 27.Cat tried, but failed on Tuesday to climb back above its 50-day moving average. Leading stocks tend to travel above their 50-day lines in preparation for a potential breakout. The good news for Cat shareholders is that the stock is trading less than 6% below its 52-week high of 99.46.United Tech, meanwhile, has made limited upside progress since the stock rallied past a 109.52 cup-with-handle entry point in late November and early December.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite were practically flat. However, losing stocks were outpacing winning issues by a nearly 4-to-3 margin on the Nasdaq. On the NYSE, winners and losers were roughly evenly matched. The Russell 2000 lost 0.2%.Volume was running mildly lower vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges.While the medical sector remains a laggard, here are four stocks to consider for your watchlist. PRA Health (PRAH) is ranked No. 32 on the IBD 50. The stock edged 0.2% lower to 64.62, but is showing gains after busting through stubborn resistance at 60.The Raleigh, N.C., clinical trials firm has grown earnings per share 108%, 74%, 34%, 34%, 23% and 20% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Due in part to a tough year-over-year comparison, Wall Street sees earnings up just 9%, to 60 cents a share, in Q1.PRA holds a good 94 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 from IBD Stock Checkup.Celgene (CELG) has been trading quietly lately, but at 124.35 the top-performing biotech is still up nominally from a Feb. 28 breakout past a 122.49 cup-with-handle entry.Celgene is trading firmly above its 50-day moving average, which itself has been rising for more than six weeks. A 73 Relative Price Strength Rating is not superb, but it's a meaningful improvement from as low as 35 eight weeks ago. A 73 RS rating means that the large-cap biotech, which specializes in treatments for cancer and immunological disorders, is now outperforming 73% of all stocks in IBD's database over the past 12 months.Other notable leaders in IBD's biotech group are Incyte (INCY) and small-cap epilepsy and ADHD specialist Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN). Both are up sharply for the year so far. A fourth  member of the biotech group is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which rose 4% to 111.45 in heavy trading, four days after it zoomed up 20% in massive trading on positive clinical trial data regarding its two-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis.And Loveland, Colo.-based Heska (HSKA), a thinly traded expert in veterinary products, continues to soar after it cleared a 57.51 buy point in huge volume on Nov. 1.Keep in mind that Heska, up 2% to 104.37, trades just 102,000 shares a day. Elsewhere in the stock market today, InterActiveCorp (IAC) roared off its 50-day line, rising more than 2% to 75.73 in heavy volume.The search engine operator has found nice support at its 50-day for months, after the stock cleared a 60.40 buy point within a long bottoming-base pattern in October last year.On Feb. 2, InterActiveCorp staged a profit turnaround with fourth-quarter earnings rising 84% to $1.38 a share, crushing the consensus analyst estimate by nearly 47%, despite a 4% drop in sales. That halted a four-quarter streak of shrinking profits.Now, Wall Street has revised full-year EPS estimates higher, with 2017 earnings seen up 13% to $3.34 a share and 2018 earnings up 32% to $4.41.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Is It Time To Take Profits In These 5 Leading Techs?The Income Investor: Will These 3 Dividend Leaders Finish Big In 2017?Inside The IBD 50: These 7 Leaders Are Thriving, Even After Testing The 10-Week Moving Average

399,CELG,"Many parts of President Trump's federal government have yet to take shape, but a leaner and meaner Food and Drug Administration seems almost certain.The way agency watchers see it, Trump's ""blueprint"" for the nation's pharmaceutical gatekeeper points to a funding cut. His budget outline also suggests that the user fees charged to the industry, for processing approvals, could as much as double in 2018.Yet Trump also wants a speedier FDA that pushes through more generic drugs, boosting competition. He has derided ""astronomical"" and ""outrageous"" drug prices and called for a competitive and fair drug-approval process.Drugmakers and analysts say they're all for it. They're just not sure a leaner FDA can accomplish that.""If we can support the FDA to get more funding so they can approve generic drugs faster, it'll bring down drug costs,"" said John Maraganore, CEO at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Alnylam makes expensive specialty drugs to treat hemophilia and other rare ailments. He acknowledges that more competition in the generic market would help tug down rising drug prices.""That's a competitive, marketplace-based way of doing it that would preserve the market-based, time-limited award that's really needed for innovation,"" Maraganore told Investor's Business Daily.Irina Koffler, analyst at Mizuho, agrees. The FDA now faces a 4,000-drug backlog of generic applications, she told IBD.Before it can make a dent in that backlog, the agency needs more funding, more staff and legislation to clear out a thicket of laws and legal decisions that slow down drug approvals, Koffler says.""Generic submissions are sitting there languishing while there is not enough competition,"" Koffler said. ""There's some situations where you'll have a supply monopoly where one company is the only one manufacturing a certain generic drug and therefore charges a lot for it.""Biotech and drug stocks are touchy when it comes to Trump. A March 7 tweet from the president promising more drug competition sent IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group down 1.2%.But generic drug companies actually favor more competition, says Chip Davis, chief executive for the Association for Accessible Medicines, an advocate for makers of generic drugs.Makers of generic and what are known as biosimilar drugs experience constant price deflation, he says. That backlog of 4,000 generic applications means drugs that could provide new revenue streams stay stuck on hold, awaiting FDA review or action.""The only way that over time our companies can be financially successful is if they are able to get approvals for new generics to help offset the continuing deflation that they see year over year, in their current mature portfolio,"" he told IBD. ""They fully recognize more competition creates downward pressure on pricing.""Prescription drug prices rose 11.3% in 2016, and they're projected to jump 11.6% this year for active employees and early retirees from the American workforce, according to advisory firm Segal Consulting. For retirees age 65 and older, prices are expected to rise 9.9% — a slowdown from 10.9% in 2016.It likely will take a congressional push to speed up FDA approvals. The most recent iteration of the American Health Care Act, the GOP bill that sought to replace ObamaCare, didn't touch pharmaceuticals, though Trump pledged March 20 in a Kentucky rally to work on legislation to bring down pricing.IBD'S TAKE: Since his swearing in, Trump has continued calls for drugmakers to lower their prices. What would this do to biotech and drug stocks? Read on in IBD's Industry Themes.Trump's 2018 budget blueprint hints at ""a package of administrative actions designed to achieve regulatory efficiency and speed the development of safe and effective medical products.""Trump could be on the same page with Alnylam's Maraganore, who imagines a system of FDA incentives to approve generics quickly.Congress could enact ""legislation where the FDA is incentivized to approve a second or third manufacturer for a generic drug faster,"" Maraganore said. ""You can imagine how that would help speed lowering of drug prices if the FDA has to prioritize the second and third drug approvals over other generic drug actions.""What Trump should not do is reduce drug testing for safety and effectiveness, Mizuho's Koffler says.She recalled the Thalidomide crisis of the 1950s and 1960s. Thalidomide was first marketed in Germany as an over-the-counter medication for nausea in pregnant women. In the ensuing years, some 100,000 children worldwide were born with phocomelia, or malformed limbs. About half survived.That was a turning point in the drug approval process, Koffler says. Thalidomide wasn't well-tested before being sold to a vulnerable population of pregnant women and resulted in unexpected side effects in newborns. Because of that, the FDA strengthened its drug review process.""With any drug you're taking, you have to assume what terrible things could happen: A child could take it, a pregnant woman could take it, a person who has bad kidneys or a bad heart will take it,"" she said. ""So you have to test these drugs in a more realistic and representative population of patients.""Trump's pick for FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, has talked about overhauling the FDA's process for generic complex drugs, which have allowed some branded drugs to create ""monopolies in perpetuity."" Generic complex drugs have more complex active ingredients, formulations, routes of delivery or drug-device combinations than typical generics.Gottlieb is an industry insider who formerly held positions at the FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. His nomination has drawn support across the aisle. Like Trump, Gottlieb supports more competition in the generic market while cutting down on branded monopolies.In a March 4 article in Forbes, Gottlieb noted that older generic drugs that should be sold cheaply are sometimes very costly. The prime example is Turing Pharmaceuticals' purchase of a decades-old HIV medicine in 2015. The company spiked the price to $750 a pill from $13.50 overnight.""This is often a result of failures in the way that FDA is regulating generic medicines,"" he said. ""The agency's long and costly approach to regulating generic drugs is reducing competition in the generic market and increasing the cost of manufacturing generic medicines.""Maraganore identifies more with the branded side of the aisle. He draws a distinction between generics and groundbreaking treatments. When the FDA approves a branded drug for a rare disease — like Biogen's (BIIB) Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy — or even some of the new treatments coming out now that could actually cure cancer, the drugs receive patent protection for a number of years. Generics can't make copies in that period.Maraganore calls that the ""market-based, time-limited award needed for innovation.""The generic market ""is where there ought to be the greatest amount of competition,"" he said. ""As we address challenges in our system around drug prices and drug-approval processes, we need to be careful that reform that might look good or sound good is in fact good, to preserve the innovation engine we have in this country.""In January, Trump told execs from Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Novartis (NVS) and Merck (MRK) that he would cut 75%-80% of regulations to smooth the FDA approval process.According to the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society, Trump pledged to ""streamline the process so that from your standpoint, when you actually have a drug, you can actually get it approved instead of waiting many, many years.""Mizuho's Koffler notes that at least one law could be revised. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 stays a generic drug application for 30 months, allowing the patent holder time to litigate against the generic filer and protect its patent. That 30-month clock is in place regardless of how dire the need is for the drug.""If you could legislate that stay away — that mandatory 30 months — that would help expedite the litigation process between the branded and generic companies and create a lot more competition,"" she said.Davis, of the generic drug makers' advocacy group, argues that Congress ought to tackle a decade-old law that requires the makers and the FDA to take additional safety measures when a drug could have risky side effects if not properly administered.Branded companies are taking advantage of the 2007 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies law to prevent generics from purchasing samples of the drugs, he says.Davis contends that some companies have used risk evaluation programs ""to create a limited distribution program that doesn't allow generic companies to legally purchase samples of those drugs, which they need to do the clinical testing so they can submit an application to the FDA to compete against the originator product,"" he said.""There needs to be legislation to make sure (risk evaluation) can only be used for its intended purpose and not to delay competition from generics or biosimilars going forward,"" he said. A bill in the House now would just study the matter ""and the reality is everyone has known for five years this is a problem.""Trump's budget blueprint offers the clearest view yet of how he wants to run the FDA, but it doesn't clear away all the smoke.Trump argues that ""industries that benefit from FDA's approvals can and should pay for their share"" in a ""constrained budget environment."" But the proposal doesn't detail a specific 2018 budget figure for the FDA.In 2016, the FDA budget grew 9% to $4.9 billion. This year, the FDA has asked for an 8% increase to $5.1 billion. The industry is bracing for a potential cut to agency funding in 2018, indicated by the proposed jump in user fees.Under the law, the FDA collects fees from drugmakers — branded, generic and biosimilar — to fund the drug-approval process. Trump's blueprint proposes a boost in those fees to $2 billion.The agreed-upon user fee between the industry and FDA for 2018 isn't publicly available, says Davis, so it's difficult to know how it will mesh with Trump's blueprint. Those deals were formed over ""months and months of dialogue"" and both generics and biosimilars came away satisfied, he says.Trump's $2 billion blueprint likely includes branded, generic and biosimilars, which are set to pay $1.2 billion in fees this year. It's unclear whether Trump's plan includes other types of user fees. In all, FDA user fees amounted to $2.1 billion in 2017.The Alliance for a Stronger FDA — a coalition of consumer/patient groups, health professionals and trade associations — called Trump's user-fee jump ""neither wise nor realistic"" in a March 16 statement.""Not wise because FDA's core responsibilities — safe and effective medical products and safe foods — need to be supported in large measure by the public, who is the primary beneficiary,"" the group said. ""Not realistic because the drug and device industries have recently completed user fee agreement negotiations with FDA.""

402,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stocks sustained downgrades Friday as rivals like Kite Pharma (KITE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) look likely to chip away at their lead in immuno-oncology drugs.The duo is about a year ahead with a drug called bb2121, part of a class of treatments that aim to ""reprogram"" the immune system to fight cancer using what are known as CAR-T therapies. Their drug does this by targeting an antigen called BCMA.But the landscape of anti-BCMA CAR-T drugs is about to evolve, BTIG analyst Dane Leone wrote in a note to clients. Leone downgraded Celgene and Bluebird stocks to neutral from buy.""We think Bluebird has a good lead over the competition and is smart to quick-start a second-generation effort with bb2121, which will begin a Phase 1 study during the second half of 2017,"" he said. ""That said, competitive efforts will be ramping up.""Kite is beginning an anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy in humans in the third quarter. Juno began work in February on a bone marrow cancer drug. Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and GenMab started an anti-BCMA effort in May, and updates are expected soon from Novartis (NVS).RELATED: Which companies are outperforming 95% of stocks? It's all relative. Visit IBD Data Stories for the formula to correctly identify stock leaders.In Bluebird's case, Leone is more optimistic than most about a drug called LentiGlobin to treat two blood disorders. He expects the drug to generate a combined $870 million in both disorders by 2021.Still, ""the oncology shift may be divisive (among) investors, as the competitiveness within cell-based therapies for oncology is much more intense than areas within rare diseases,"" he said. ""But the early success with bb2121 is supportive of a broader effort in larger markets with better defined patient populations.""For Celgene, Leone cut his expectations for Crohn's disease drug mongersen to $80 million for 2020 vs. earlier views for $468 million and the consensus model for $432 million.He also expects Celgene's multiple-sclerosis drug known as ozanimod to penetrate less of the market. He cut his views for 2020 to $1 billion vs. earlier expectations for $1.4 billion, though that still tops broader Wall Street's model for $965 million.""We think that it may take longer than we expected for ozanimod to differentiate vs. the rest of the S1P class within multiple sclerosis, specifically siponimod,"" he said. The latter is a drug from Novartis.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Celgene lost dipped 1.4% to 129.87, as Bluebird fell 3% to 105.05.RELATED:The Cure For Cancer?

404,CELG,"Imagine being told you have cancer, and have six months to live.The usual steps are taken — one or two rounds of chemotherapy, perhaps a stem-cell transplant — but all of it could be to no avail. Half of all patients diagnosed with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a form of blood cancer, will die within six months, says Christine Cassiano, spokeswoman for Kite Pharma (KITE), a developer of cancer treatments.XBut say your doctor has access to an experimental treatment that can be custom-tailored to your immune system. He removes a vial of blood and sends it off to a lab where your immune system cells will be reprogrammed to fight cancer. Days or weeks later, the cells are reintroduced to your body.It's called CAR-T therapy. And what once sounded like a concoction straight out of a Mary Shelley novel is rapidly coming to fruition. In three-month follow-ups, Kite Pharma and Novartis (NVS) have seen strong results in patients with a specific type of blood cancer. This could mean a major payout of around a half-million dollars per patient treated by these companies. It could also go so far as to put cancer into remission for select patients.""When Kite Pharma was founded in 2009, most people actually felt the idea of CAR-T therapy used in the commercial setting was science fiction,"" Cassiano told Investor's Business Daily. ""But it was something our CEO believed in firmly.""Novartis looks likely to cross the CAR-T finish line first with its CTL019 set to go before the Food and Drug Administration in July. If Novartis' drug gains approval, it could pave the way for Kite's KTE-C19 later this year. In 2018 and beyond, Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are likely to follow with their own CAR-T drugs.That possibility of success has sent Kite, Bluebird and Juno stocks rocketing over the past month. Bluebird stock was up more than 45% during June as Kite shares jumped more than 40%. Juno soared 36%. Novartis stock was up 3% in June after rising 10% over the prior two months.Israeli immunologist Zelig Eshhar and American immunologist Steven Rosenberg theorized in the 1980s and 1990s that one could harness the immune system to seek and destroy cancer. The challenge? Cancer cells are good at camouflaging themselves.Eshhar and Rosenberg, who heads up the National Cancer Institute's tumor immunology section, developed the first CAR-T therapies in the 1990s. They first looked to treat melanoma, but scientists have since found that CAR-T drugs work particularly well in blood cancers.""CAR-T is the best form of immuno-oncology,"" according to Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay. Immuno-oncology drugs harness the immune system to treat cancer.To create the drug, researchers extract the immune system cells from a patient's blood. Using an ""empty"" virus, they affix what are known as chimeric antigen receptors to immune system T-cells, Chattopadhyay told IBD.Chimeric antigen receptors, also known as CAR, are proteins that can recognize proteins that cancer cells use to hide in the body. When the immune system's T-cells are reintroduced to the body, they are directed to seek out and destroy cells carrying those specific proteins.Because the process is so complex and individualized, CAR-T drugs cannot be mass produced.""So there are multiple steps involved in all of this,"" Chattopadhyay said. ""But the bigger challenge really is: You can't just put everything into a mixture and have something come out of the other side, because every patient is different.""Adding to the challenge, most patients who undergo CAR-T therapy are doing so as a last resort. In a study of patients with the blood cancer multiple myeloma, presented in June by Bluebird and its CAR-T drug development partner, biotech giant Celgene (CELG), 15 patients had received three to 14 prior therapies.IBD'S TAKE: CAR-T drugmakers could help the biotech sector recover from several years of sideways performance, analysts say. Head on to the Industry Snapshot for a deeper dive into which stocks look strong for 2017.Harvesting enough healthy immune system cells from those patients can be tricky, Chattopadhyay said. And in some lymphomas, Kite and Novartis have discovered the cancer mutates. Once that happens, the initial protein target will no longer work, rendering the CAR-T therapy moot.Still, Rosenberg theorized in 2013 that CAR-T therapy could become ""a standard therapy for some B-cell malignancies"" which include a number of blood cancers. CAR-T hasn't yet shown promise in solid tumors, Chattopadhyay said.Whether it can in the future is ""the million-dollar question,"" he said. Drugmakers also are looking at what's called T-cell receptor technology, or TCR. Finding the right protein targets is a struggle. Often the protein shows up in other tissues, meaning the immune system could attack the organs.Novartis is leading the CAR-T market, Chattopadhyay says. The No. 3 drugmaker by market cap has a meeting with the FDA in July to discuss approval for CTL019 in young adult and pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a bone marrow cancer common in children.Four months later, Kite is set to discuss its application for its drug, currently designated KTE-C19, in the blood cancer known as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Kite will have first-mover advantage in that setting, spokeswoman Cassiano said.""That sets the precedence for pricing — what the companies want to price the drug at and what the payers want to pay for it,"" Chattopadhyay said. ""It's going to be an interesting time for CAR-T because it's the first of its kind, it is complex to make and it will be expensive initially.""He imagines CAR-T therapies could eventually replace some stem-cell transplants and will likely be priced along those lines. Initial adoption will likely take place at transplant centers where a lot of the infrastructure is already in place. He sees price tags around $300,000 to $700,000 per therapy.Cassiano wouldn't discuss pricing. She emphasized the strong results Kite saw in a recent trial of patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. At 8.7 months, 82% of patients saw their tumors shrink, with 39% in complete remission and responses still ongoing in 44% of patients.""It's a really dramatic rate of response when you look at this patient population,"" she said. ""What normally happens when they reach this point in their diagnosis, they have roughly a 50% chance of dying within six months.""Juno also is working on a CAR-T drug to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Comparing their trials at three months, Juno's JCAR017 showed a 66% overall response rate vs. 45% and 39% for Novartis' and Kite's drugs, respectively, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a June 7 note.""JCAR017 looks very competitive to both Novartis' and Kite's data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma when compared apples-to-apples,"" he wrote. ""The jury is still out on how durability of response compares at six or 12 months, but we think it's too early to declare these products differentiated.""Bluebird may lag Novartis and Kite in terms of commercialization, but its CAR-T drug has had arguably the strongest trial results, Janney's Chattopadhyay and Leerink's Schmidt said following the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference this month in Chicago.There, Bluebird and Celgene said the drug now known as bb2121 while in testing resulted in a 100% overall response rate in patients with multiple myeloma, a cancer that forms in a white blood cell called a plasma cell, according to the Mayo Clinic. Of 15 patients evaluated, all signs of cancer disappeared in 27% of them.Data from Bluebird and Celgene were ""among the most impressive early data sets we have seen in the CAR-T space to date,"" Schmidt wrote in a June 6 note to clients. The duo set a ""high bar"" for rivals Novartis, Kite and Juno, which are all a year ahead.""Responses occurred fast and were durable and all 15 patients were still in remission with up to one year follow-up while CAR-T cells persisted over the same time frame,"" Schmidt wrote. Only two of the 15 patients experienced serious side effects.Unlike in Kite and Novartis' cases, the cancer hasn't mutated, Chattopadhyay said. So, if the patient relapses, it's possible the patient could undergo a second CAR-T treatment. A Chinese company also working on a multiple myeloma CAR-T drug had a similar result, he said.""The Bluebird/Celgene program looked quite remarkable,"" he said. ""There's something different about that program. It might not be the program, it might just be the disease. We'll have a better picture by the end of the year after a Phase 1 study.""RELATED:This Small Biotech Soared On Its Celgene-Partnered TrialPuma Leads Massive Biotech Surge As Esperion Hits 15-Month HighSmall Biotech Pops As Rival Novartis Struggles To Keep Pace

410,CELG,"Dow component Merck (MRK) ""clearly won the battle"" in trials demonstrating cancer treatments over the weekend during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, an analyst said Monday.Investment bank Leerink noted combination data with Incyte (INCY) looked strong. Merck's Keytruda and Incyte's still-unapproved epacadostat were combined to treat an array of tumor types. All signs of cancer disappeared for two lung cancer patients who'd already undergone a prior round of therapy.Epacadostat is what's known as an IDO inhibitor. Keytruda is called a PD-1 inhibitor. Both are immuno-oncology drugs that work by blocking specific interactions that would prevent an immune response.But Merck and Incyte were far from alone on the immuno-oncology scene during the annual meeting in Chicago. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY), NewLink Genetics (NLNK), Celgene (CELG) and Exelixis (EXEL) are all also looking to combine their drugs for better cancer-busting efficiency.Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy were combined in advanced lung cancer patients over two years. Data show the combo has little incremental benefit vs. Opdivo as a monotherapy but Yervoy is ""far from dead,"" Leerink analysts say.Opdivo is similar to Merck's Keytruda, whereas Yervoy works to inhibit an immune reaction involving the CTLA-4 protein receptor. Some patients are more susceptible to PD-1 inhibitors due to genetics. But cancer disappeared in 8% of all patients regardless of their genes.Roche is also combining its Tecentriq, which attacks cancer cells that camouflage themselves behind PD-L1 proteins, with NewLink Genetics' IDO inhibitor. The results looked safe and consistent with epacadostat, Leerink analysts said. Overall, 10% of patients had a response. The data are still new.IBD'S TAKE: Keep track of the biotech industry by bookmarking IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Bristol is also working on emerging immuno-oncological targets in combination trials to treat multiple tumor types including one that could rival Incyte's epacadostat. Bristol, though, is partnered with Incyte on several ongoing trials.Outside immuno-oncology alone, companies like Tesaro (TSRO) are combining what are called PARP inhibitors with PD-1 inhibitors like Merck's Keytruda, an Evercore analyst said. In that vein, half of ovarian cancer patients responded and the remainder reached disease stability.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 432-company Biomed/Biotech industry group was down less than 1%. Ethical drug stocks fell nearly 1%.RELATED:Tesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' DataHow Clovis, AstraZeneca Could 'Muddy' A Potential Deal For TesaroDow's Merck Beats Out Rival Bristol In Melanoma Study

411,CELG,"U.S. stock indexes gripped slender gains midday Thursday, as strength in biotechs offset weakness in chip stocks. Celgene (CELG) was among the leading big-cap biotechs that added gains after a recent breakout.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average each rose between 0.1% and 0.2% at 12 p.m. ET. The small cap Russell 2000 added just over 0.2%. Volume in the stock market at midday was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.The biotech industry group was on track for a fifth consecutive daily gain. Action within the group was bullish.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) pushed 3% higher. The stock is now 19% above a 453.06 buy point. Celgene headed toward its ninth gain in 10 sessions. The stock added almost 1% midday Thursday after clearing a 127.74 buy point Wednesday. The 5% buy zone is capped at 133.81.Bioverativ (BIVV) , a February initial public offering and a new member of Leaderboard, slowed to a 0.1% gain after breaking out Monday. The stock remains in the 5% buy zone from a 58.98 buy point.Bioverativ, Regeneron and Celgene have EPS Ratings of 93, 94 and 98 respectively, which means they are growing earnings faster than 93%, 94% and 98% of the entire IBD database of publicly traded companies. Some biotechs hustling higher in the past few days are still posting annual losses. While investing in a company that is losing money is not prudent, the action points to conviction for the group.Going into Thursday's market, the biotech group was No. 23 of 197 groups. Three weeks ago, biotechs were No. 45.Meanwhile, the chip designer, chipmaker and chip equipment maker groups were down moderately.Oil stocks were rebounding as West Texas intermediate crude oil popped 1.3%. The price of crude oil recently touched 10-month lows.Blue chips were about evenly split between up for the day and down for the day. Dow Jones industrial average component Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) dropped 1%, while UnitedHealth (UNH) rose about 1.5% ahead of news that the U.S. Senate is set to unveil a new plan to reform the Affordable Care Act.In the IBD 50, a proxy for leading stocks, medical software provider Medidata Solutions (MDSO) led with a 4.5% thrust.

413,CELG,"X The Nasdaq composite on Wednesday deflected yet another pounding in crude oil futures and related companies in the stock market, moving moderately higher as the Dow Jones industrial average harbored light losses late in Wall Street's regular session.The Nasdaq composite, up 0.7% at around 3:45 p.m. New York time, is stretching its year-to-date lead over the S&P 500 (down fractionally Wednesday) and the Dow Jones industrials (down 0.2%) despite showing five distribution days over the past 25 sessions. Volume on Wednesday is running higher on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday and lower on the Nasdaq.IBD's Big Picture column tracks heavy institutional selling in the form of distribution days, as witnessed in the Nasdaq on Tuesday (down 0.8%, higher volume than on Monday); a sudden rash of big declines in heavier volume than the prior session is enough to kill a bull market.The Nasdaq is up nearly 16% since Jan. 1, towering over the S&P 500's 8.8% advance. The Dow Jones industrial average is also lagging after a 13.4% gain in 2016, up 8.3% so far this year.Buying in the biotech and software sectors continued unabated in the aftermath of solid quarterly results from the likes of Adobe Systems (ADBE) (extended after a breakout at 111.19 in January) and Red Hat (RHT) (also extended from an 81.24 early entry in a long, choppy first-stage base).In the biotech group, which jumped to No. 31 among IBD's 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance, Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) all pumped more than 5% higher in heavy turnover, showing the kind of action seen by iPhone giant Apple (AAPL) during its big runs in the mid-2000s and early part of the 2010s.Celgene has a market value of $103 billion, Regeneron is at $55 billion, and Vertex at $33 billion, vs. $760 billion for the iPhone, iPad and MacBook maker.When a stock breaks out, it tends to already be close to 52-week or all-time highs, already be trading above the 50- and 200-day moving averages, show a tremendous increase in share volume, and show strong finishes during its up sessions in prices.That's definitely the case with the three biomedical names mentioned above. All three are highly profitable developers of novel therapies to address difficult diseases and chronic conditions.Celgene ran 5% higher to 132.38 and powered past a 127.74 cup-base buy point in volume that is currently triple usual levels. The stock's 50-day average volume is 3.7 million shares. That cup could be seen as part of a long saucer base that goes all the way back to its July 2015 peak of 140.72.Notice on a weekly chart how Celgene had broken out of a three-month saucer pattern at 129.16 in July 2015, but did a hairpin curve lower and undercut the low of that base. Such action was a healthy shakeout of uncommitted investors and reset the base count back to zero. The Street sees first-quarter profit at the Summit, N.J., firm rising 24% to $1.78 a share. Celgene has posted EPS increases of 17%, 23%, 17%, 28%, 36% and 27% in the prior six quarters.Celgene sports an outstanding 98 Composite Rating and a 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. Watch to see if its 68 Relative Price Strength score improves in the near term.Regeneron (97 Composite Rating, 94 EPS Rating) is extended from a first-stage bottoming-base entry at 453.06 as shares have soared more than 13% so far this week to 521.71. However, notice on a weekly chart how the stock may run into some upside resistance in the 550 to 590 price level.Vertex (98 Composite, 79 EPS) surged 5% to 133.30 in fast turnover and is moving further past a recent handle on a long base, giving a solid entry at 122.06 (10 cents above the May 2 intraday high). In the handle, the stock sloped lower along the intraday lows and corrected no more than 7%.Back to Apple, the megacap tech is showing it still may have the wherewithal to recover from a sharp sell-off in the prior two weeks that triggered two key sell signals (read this Stock Market Today column to learn more about the exact sell rules).Apple gained around 0.6% to 145.59. Volume is light, but the stock is limiting its drop below the 50-day moving average to around 2%.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating remains strong for now at 85, much better than the lowly 59 seen at the start of the year. However, keep in mind that the RS Rating covers 12 months' worth of price action vs. the rest of the market. Extra weight is given to the most recent three months' worth of action.There are plenty of reasons for long-term holders with a thick profit cushion to keep holding: 1) Apple is still well above its long-term 200-day moving average; 2) earnings picture is improving, with FY 2017 profit seen up 8% and FY 2018 profit up 18%; revenue growth in Apple's services unit is currently at solid double-digit pace; and 4) the likelihood of a major iPhone replacement cycle beginning in the fourth quarter of the current calendar year is very high.IBD's TAKE: One way to track emerging industry sector rotation within the market is to watch changes in the IBD 50. Right now, it's still chock-full of electronic, internet, computer and networking-related stocks. But will medicals and biotechs stage a larger presence. Go here every day to watch new leaders unfold, presenting wonderful new opportunities for investing profits.In the IBD 50, tech leaders Nvidia (NVDA), Coherent (COHR) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) have all recovered nicely from price spills in the prior two weeks and remain in solid uptrends.RELATED:Investor's Corner: The Bottoming Base And How It Makes Money For Astute TradersInvestor's Corner II: Why Apple Formed A Bottoming Base In 2009Where Is The Market Headed?

414,CELG,"XThe Nasdaq continued to hold the leadership baton in afternoon trading Wednesday, helped by another solid showing for biotech stocks as well as a couple of strong earnings reports from two high-profile software names.Among biotechs, Celgene (CELG) soared past a 127.74 buy point, rising more than 4% to 131.86. But after seven gains in the past eight sessions, the daily chart has a straight-up-off-the-bottom look to it, making Celgene's latest base a bit lopsided.The Nasdaq added 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 showed modest losses. Volume on both exchanges was tracking close to Tuesday's levels.West Texas Intermediate crude oil for July lost nearly 3% to $42.31 a barrel after U.S. government data showed a second straight weekly decline for crude inventories, along with a rise in domestic production.Wall Street cheered earnings reports from two well-run software names that have transitioned successfully to the cloud. Red Hat (RHT) soared 10% after reporting a 12% rise in quarterly profit and 19% increase in sales to $676.8 million. It's extended in price at this point, meaning it's too late to buy. Shares of Adobe Systems (ADBE) jumped 2% as adjusted earnings rose 44% to $1.02 share. Sales grew 27% to $1.77 billion.Another software name working toward a cloud-based model is Oracle (ORCL), which reports today after the close. Shares rose 1% to 46.26 ahead of the results as it works on a flat base with a 47.09 buy point.Elsewhere, RV-maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) broke out of a downtrend with conviction, rising 11%, after reporting better-than-expected earnings and its fourth straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Aggressive investors got an early entry into Winnebago on Wednesday even though the stock is still 17% off its high.CarMax (KMX), which operates used-car superstores in the U.S., reversed in spectacular fashion. Shares edged higher after rising 8% intraday. Headed into the report, CarMax was working on a cup-with-handle base with a 65.90 buy point, but it was a flawed pattern because of recent uncertain action around the 50-day moving average. Handle areas should always form comfortably above the 50-day line.In economic news, existing home sales for May came in slightly better than expected, but homebuilders didn't move much on the news. iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB), an exchange-traded fund, was mostly unchanged around 34.

421,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) stock dipped to a four-month low Monday on Wall Street disappointment that its potential blockbuster drug, ozanimod, failed to delay the accumulation of physical disabilities in multiple sclerosis patients compared with interferon.But ozanimod did meet its primary goal, reducing annual relapse rates for patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Celgene said in a news statement it plans to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year.On the stock market today, Celgene stock was down 1% to 115.71, after earlier falling as much as 2.8% to touch a low last seen Jan. 31. Shares began forming a flat base in mid-March, but dropped below the lower level on Monday. Rival Novartis (NVS) stock was up 1.1%, near 81.29.Ozanimod was compared to FDA-approved interferon Avonex in a two-year trial of 1,313 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Both 0.5-milligram and 1-mg doses of ozanimod demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in annual relapse rates.Celgene's drug also reduced new or enlarging lesions over two years vs. Avonex. But, in a pooled analysis of Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of ozanimod, the drug failed to show a statistically significant improvement on disability vs. Avonex. That could put it at a disadvantage to Novartis' Gilenya.IBD'S TAKE: Can't seem to get a handle on the biotech market? Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at what can be a complex sector — and why your best stock bets this year might not be the biggest names in the game.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges doesn't expect the disability point to hamper ozanimod's approval. Safety was similar in this trial to an earlier Phase 3 study of ozanimod, Celgene said. Full results will be presented at a future medical conference.""While the lack of disability benefit is disappointing, we do not believe it will limit ozanimod's chances for approval given the significance and clinical benefit of the primary endpoint,"" he wrote in a note to clients.However, it will limit ozanimod in its competition vs. Novartis' Gilenya, Porges said. Like ozanimod, Gilenya belongs to a class of drugs that modulate a specific receptor to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis. Gilenya is approved with a note indicating it can delay the accumulation of physical disability.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat called the disability question ""the No. 1 investor focus"" for Celgene's trial, dubbed Radiance. Still, those expectations were displaced, Raffat wrote in a note to clients. Novartis' rival drug Gilenya never showed an ""extraordinary"" statistically significant disability benefit vs. Avonex.The bigger question for ozanimod is whether Gilenya remains branded in 2019 as generic competitors creep begin looking at the market. There's a ""realistic chance"" that Gilenya remains unchallenged by generics, though, as a number of important patents are in place.Celgene and Novartis will also have to contend with Roche which recently grabbed approval for its ""game changer"" multiple sclerosis drug, Ocrevus. Ocrevus alone is approved for both forms of multiple sclerosis — relapsing-remitting and primary progressive.RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisDid Regeneron, Sanofi Just Launch A Blockbuster Drug?How Celgene Toppled On A Small-Cap Biotech's Ragged Quarter
"
422,CELG,"It was just a year ago that the formula seemed right for Biogen (BIIB), the fourth-largest company in its industry, to mix up a biotechnology megamerger.Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise — a lineup of six drugs that includes Tecfidera and Tysabri — was growing. Tecfidera, Biogen's most important drug, brought in $3.97 billion in 2016, up 9%.Further, hemophilia sales, though small, grew 53% in 2016 to $847 million between just two brand-name drugs, Eloctate and Alprolix. And Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, grabbed FDA approval just days before Christmas.The plot thickened when Biogen's chief executive, George Scangos, resigned in July, leaving the company susceptible to takeout by the likes of Merck (MRK), Allergan (AGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Pfizer (PFE). Takeout rumors abounded, and Biogen stock ended 2016 down 6.2%, making it a cheaper asset to buy.""I thought last year was really the time for it to happen,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. ""What Biogen offered last year was a relatively stable MS business that was still growing, a robust cash flow scheme, the opportunity for Spinraza and the hemophilia franchise. So an acquirer could say, 'I get all of that.' ""Fast-forward to today, and the picture is entirely different. Biogen is seeing increasing competition in the MS market, payers are balking at Spinraza prices, and the company has already taken its hemophilia drugs out of the equation.Now, only 24% of Wall Street sees Biogen as a potential takeout candidate in 2017, according to a Mizuho survey. And Porges says Biogen will probably have to wait until 2020 to see the deals roll in, if ever.""I think it has become significantly less likely,"" Porges said.So, what happened?After an incredibly successful 2016 in multiple sclerosis — including the launch of Zinbryta with AbbVie (ABBV) — Biogen's MS unit is facing looming competition from the likes of Roche (RHHBY) and Celgene (CELG), Porges told Investor's Business Daily.In a note to clients on April 7, Porges called Roche's Ocrevus a ""game-changer."" Ocrevus was approved in late March to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS, separating itself from the pack that is only approved for the relapsing-remitting form.""Both the MS physician and patient communities have been eagerly awaiting the Ocrevus launch,"" Porges said. ""The drug's high efficacy, reasonable safety profile and convenient six-month dosing schedule are all major factors in the drug's positive reception.""That spells trouble for Biogen, as Tecfidera had comprised 40% of total product sales as well as 76% of the MS unit. Biogen is actually partnered with Roche on Ocrevus, but the royalty won't be enough to offset erosion to its own MS franchise, analysts say.Porges expects Ocrevus to get 60% of the primary progressive MS market within three to four years. In the relapsing-remitting MS market, Porges sees 40%-50% erosion of Tysabri, and 30%-40% erosion of Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya sales.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on an MS drug called ozanimod in Phase 3 testing. In function, ozanimod is closest to Novartis' Gilenya, though it could also rival Tecfidera or Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio. Tecfidera, Gilenya and Aubagio, respectively, lead the MS market in terms of sales.""If Celgene wanted to buy a sales force and have something overnight to help sell ozanimod, Biogen could be that company,"" Porges told IBD. But with Biogen likely to suffer erosion from Roche competition in MS, that's looking less probable.The silver lining? Biogen won a patent and an interference case against Forward Pharma (FWP) over Tecfidera, though it was out a $1.25 billion settlement fee. Forward stock toppled 22.5% on the decision as it now loses out on a major royalty.Biogen's Spinraza has a different set of troubles. Developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Spinraza is the first and only drug approved for the rare neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting in infants and children.Wall Street largely thought of Spinraza as a slam dunk. It had ""profound efficacy"" in two August 2016 studies in infants and children. The drug was so effective that Biogen and Ionis ended the studies early, Ionis Chief Executive Stanley Crooke told IBD in December.Spinraza was approved Dec. 23 with a fairly broad label. It's approved for use in children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy and remains the only drug approved for the disease that Crooke called ""catastrophic.""""This drug, of all things, should be rapidly adopted and widely reimbursed,"" Porges said. ""And what may have happened was what appeared to be good fortune with the label may have turned into a liability because payers became concerned too many patients would start on the drug so they restricted access.""Mizuho analyst Salim Syed calls 2017 ""largely a Spinraza story."" Biogen is set to report its first-quarter earnings on April 25. That will be particularly telling following the launch of Spinraza earlier this year. Analysts say, though, that payers are pushing back hard on reimbursements of the drug.Insurers Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are only reimbursing patients on Spinraza with the most severe form of the disease, Type 1. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has a broader policy, covering Type 1, 2 and 3 patients. That could be because Spinraza costs $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year, and $375,000 in subsequent years, making it a pricey drug.The consensus is projecting $15 million in first-quarter Spinraza sales, Syed said.Porges lowered his expectations for Spinraza for 2017 to $266 million from $400 million. Sales results for the first quarter will be especially telling, he told IBD. North of 100 patients on the drug would be ""pretty good — as long as they're seeing continued starts.""Then there's Biogen's hemophilia drug lineup.In February, Biogen spun off its hemophilia franchise into Bioverativ (BIVV). Since then, Bioverativ shares are up 27%, which is great — for Bioverativ. But any company considering a Biogen takeover might think again without that unit, Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ isn't your standard biotech startup. Head to The New America to find out why.Bioverativ has yet to announce any quarterly results, having only been public since early February. The company is set to release its first-quarter earnings results on May 3. In its last full quarter with Biogen, that hemophilia unit brought in $242 million, up 11.5% year over year.Now, Porges says it would be smart for Biogen to also spin off its multiple sclerosis unit and turn its focus toward Alzheimer's. In Alzheimer's Biogen is following Eli Lilly and Merck, both of which had notable failures in December and February.Biogen's Alzheimer's play is the strongest in the sector, analysts say.In March, RBC analyst Michael Yee told IBD that Pfizer and Merck are the likeliest players to make a bid on Biogen. They would be ""interested in more branded drugs and particularly the Alzheimer's pipeline.""Biogen is working on two classes of Alzheimer's drugs — one that works to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's and another called a BACE inhibitor with Eisai. BACE inhibitors aim to prevent the plaque buildup.Porges says Biogen will likely have to wait until 2020 to see renewed takeover interest. In 2020, Biogen is expected to release the results of two Phase 3 trials of aducanumab. Its BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat, is also in a Phase 3 trial with results expected after September 2020.Eli Lilly's solanezumab worked on the theory that it would remove plaque buildup — called beta amyloid — in the brain. Merck's verubecestat was a BACE inhibitor. But both failed, and there are only a handful of potential Alzheimer's drugs in development now.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) is working on a different theory of treatment that doesn't involve beta amyloid. It expects to have Phase 3 data of its drug, intepirdine, later this year. That, too, could change the Alzheimer's landscape and potentially further dent Biogen's chances of a merger.Still, Biogen's board will place a high premium on its Alzheimer's pipeline if it ever comes to the acquisition table, Porges said. That's because everything else has failed and development costs for aducanumab and elenbecestat have headed toward the billions of dollars, Porges said.""If you're willing to take the risk on Alzheimer's, it still makes some sense as an acquisition, but what I've heard from people in and around the industry is they're struggling to bridge the gap,"" he said. ""The board wants to be paid for Alzheimer's as if it's going to work.""RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisBiogen Dives As Takeover Buzz Fades, Drugs Hit SnagsCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

423,CELG,"Biogen (BIIB) is paying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) $300 million upfront to license a palsy drug with a $2 billion market opportunity and the potential to use that to treat Alzheimer's, an analyst said Thursday.The deal was announced early Thursday in conjunction with a separate agreement with Roche (RHHBY). Roche will license a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug from Bristol, according to a news release from Bristol. Both agreements are expected to close in the second quarter.""Licensing these assets to Biogen and Roche will enable Bristol-Myers Squibb to prioritize the other promising opportunities for asset development that have advanced across our diversified portfolio,"" said Mike Burgess, head of Bristol's cardiovascular, fibrosis and immuno-science development.By the closing bell on the stock market today, investors only rewarded Biogen, which gained 1.1% to 271.88. Bristol was down a fraction 52.83. Roche stock fell 1%, to 31.92.Under the Biogen deal, the No. 4 biotech will pay Bristol $410 million in milestone payments and a tiered double-digit royalty to license a drug known only as BMS-986168. The drug just completed Phase 1 testing in progressive supranuclear palsy.The palsy, also called Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, is a rare brain disorder that causes difficulty in walking, balance and eye movements, according to the Mayo Clinic. The drug Biogen is licensing is known as an anti-Tau. Anti-Taus have been investigated in the treatment of Alzheimer's.In Alzheimer's, Taus are proteins that build up in the brain. The process causes tangles in nerve cells, breaking down communication, experts say. The Bristol/Biogen drug cut down on Tau and plaque buildup in the brain by 65% to 96% in healthy volunteers during Phase 1 testing.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen shares have been in a flat base since reaching a high of 312.40 on Aug. 2. The stock gets a Composite Rating of 81 from Investor's Business Daily, meaning it outperforms 81% of all stocks. It currently ranks 19th in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Group, with Celgene (CELG) in the top spot.A Phase 2 trial with 400 patients is underway with a readout expected in mid-2019. In the palsy drug, Biogen could see a $2 billion market, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat estimated. The market is bigger in Alzheimer's. There, Biogen is already working on two other drugs.In using an anti-Tau in both palsy and Alzheimer's treatments, Biogen will face off with AbbVie (ABBV).  AbbVie is also in Phase 2 testing with its drug, known as ABBV-8E12 and is on a similar timeline, Raffat noted. Its Phase 2 trial began in January with 400 patients.Per the second deal, Roche will license Bristol's drug, called BMS-986089. The drug is being developed as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare disease characterized by muscle degeneration and weakness.Roche will pay $170 million upfront with potential $205 million milestone payments and a tiered, double-digit royalty if the drug is approved.RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisThese Biotechs Could Save The Drug Sector In Q1 — Or NotCould Dow Stock Merck Undercut AstraZeneca In Lung Cancer?

424,CELG,"The largest biotech ETFs served up a reminder in March that investors in this high-growth industry should expect a bumpy ride. They hit their best levels in a year early on, then took a nasty tumble before bouncing back smartly from those losses.On Tuesday, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) were modestly lower but holding above the 10-week moving average — a bullish sign after a recent test of that critical marker of support. And despite a stumble in March so far, they are holding on to double-digit gains for the first quarter, vs. 12% for the S&P 500.That's a nice turnaround from a plunge of more than 10% for many biotech exchange traded funds the prior quarter, which coincided with hawkish election rhetoric about price-gouging in the drug industry.The latest rally comes despite major setbacks this month, including Trump tweets on drug prices and serious blows to big-name biotechs Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), which cast a pall on the entire industry.Biotechnology ETFs rallied sharply in January and February as higher beta names swung into favor after President Trump's shock election win. Plus, investors saw these stocks as a ""value play in a growth industry,"" said Matthew Bartolini, head of research for SPDR Americas.Some market analysts still see fair-to-attractive valuations in the sector, despite its year-to-date outperformance, helping IBB earn an upgrade recently.In light of improving valuations, however, two things will be key to the next leg up for this industry, in Bartolini's view.First, biotechs have to deliver on their promise of growth.Many smaller firms like Kite Pharma (KITE) and Esperion (ESPR) are unprofitable or have no sales, and even industry bellwethers such as Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Incyte (INCY) are in earnings slumps.However, earnings momentum for the sector as a whole is starting to look more favorable, some analysts say. Top biotech Celgene (CELG), which earns an extremely high EPS Rating of 98 from IBD, has scored upward revisions in forward estimates.Secondly, mergers and acquisitions must come to fruition to boost share prices. Intercept (ICPT), Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen are three names being bandied about as takeover targets.XBI has outpaced peers in 2017 so far, as it has consistently over the past three-, five- and 10 years. It is up 17.9% year to date through March 27 vs. a 10.6% gain for its iShares rival, which is cap-weighted and skews toward larger companies.Bartolini considers the SPDR biotech to be well placed looking ahead as well. An equal-weighted indexing method gives it a small-cap tilt. That may be beneficial in an industry such as biotechnology, where smaller and more speculative companies have strong potential as long-term growth plays, he said.Plus, relative to cap-weighted rivals, XBI is less tied to the fortunes of the largest names in the industry. On the one hand, that makes the SPDR ETF more immune to single-stock risk and ""tweet risk,"" in Bartolini's words. However, it also will benefit less from a big price gain for the industry giants.A Trump tweet on drug pricing hit XBI and IBB hard on March 7.RELATED:Which ETFs Are Making Big Moves?

425,CELG,"Stocks are showing an impressive rebound after Monday's opening sell-off, with the Nasdaq composite turning a near 1% loss into a 0.2% gain.The Nasdaq 100, reflecting resilience in large- and megacap techs, rose 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average is turning a drop of nearly 1% into a loss of just 0.2% after falling more than 1% last week.Early Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly clipped its 50-day moving average for the first time since it fell to the south side of the key support and resistance line Sept. 9. Back then, it took nearly two months for the 30-stock Dow to rebound back above the 50-day line.Helping the Dow were DuPont (DD), which was the sole component to rise 1 point or more. At 80.66, the diversified manufacturer is a legitimate leader in the stock market today, up 9.9% since Jan. 1. Shares also are up by 13% from a recent breakout on Nov. 30, past a 71.19 flat-base buy point.The S&P 500 was down less than 0.2%.IBD Best Mutual Fund Awards: View The Winners By CategoryAmong new issues, Snap (SNAP) is getting plenty of attention on the back of positive comments from analysts and new buy ratings. Shares strode more than 6% higher to 24.18, possibly setting up its highest close in more than two weeks.On its market debut, the Snapchat social media site operator leapt past its 17-per-share IPO to finish at 24.48, then catapulted another 20% to as high as 29.44 before coming down to earth. Over the next 10 sessions, Snap slid 36% to a low of 18.90. In a normal cup or double-bottom base, the decline usually runs no more than 33% to 35% from high to low — based on IBD's research of big winners over the past 22 bull- and bear-market cycles. So, in Snap's case, the decline is on the heavy side, especially given the fact that the gain from the 17-per-share IPO did not exceed 100% or more.Despite recent positive Wall Street comments, Snap is on course to lose money in 2017 (consensus estimate of a net loss of 45 cents a share) and 2018 (-$0.32).Still, the stock deserves a close watch if the rebound continues and the stock gets to within 5% to 15% of its 29.44 peak.In most excellent cup-with-handle patterns, a stock tends to form the handle — the last final shakeout of uncommitted holders before a big breakout to new highs — while trading no more than 15% off its 52-week or all-time high.While the Trump-supported American Health Care Act never saw the light of day Friday, investors should continue to watch leading names in the medical and health care services industry groups. Celgene (CELG), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) were among the day's biggest point-winners.Celgene ranks No. 1 in the Big Cap 20; see the whole list in the latest IBD Weekly on page B19.The failure of the American Health Care Act, and future changes in former President Obama's Affordable Care Act, are unlikely to suppress demand for superior medicines to treat patients with deadly diseases such as multiple myeloma. Celgene is No. 1 in that field, and also is becoming a force in the treatment of chronic illnesses such as psoriasis.Celgene gets a wonderful 98 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup due to its consistent pattern of long-term profit increases and solid gains in the short term as well. Over the past six quarters, earnings per share rose 27%, 17%, 23%, 17%, 28% and 36% vs. year-ago levels. That's an average EPS gain of 24.7%, which is outstanding for companies with market caps of $15 billion or higher.Celgene has a $96 billion market value and 775 million shares outstanding, which is large but not excessively so. As a point of comparison, Pfizer (PFE) has 5.95 billion shares outstanding.The Street sees fiscal year 2017 profit rising 22%, to $7.22 a share, on an 18% lift in revenue to $13.29 billion. Revenue rose 24%, 27% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the prior three years.Intuitive, meanwhile, remains top of the hill in the field of robotic surgery systems. Wall Street sees earnings rising 12% to $4.93 a share in the current quarter, which would accelerate the 3% increase seen in Q4 2016.Sales are seen rising 13% to $670.2 million in Q1, up from 12% growth in Q4.Intuitive presented two buy points in 2017 so far. On Feb. 21, the stock spurted past a 72.35 cup-base entry in volume expanding nearly 40% above its 50-day average,  a sign of healthy demand by mutual funds, large investment advisers, pensions, insurers and the like. But go to a daily chart, and you'll also see a very narrow handle that formed from Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, creating a hard-to-see 700.52 early buy point.Add 10 cents to the highest price within any handle to obtain a handle entry point. Notice on a daily chart how the stock gapped up in huge volume on Jan. 25 in reaction to decent fourth-quarter results (EPS up 3%, revenue up 12%).Intuitive currently gets a solid 93 Composite Rating, better than Regeneron's 80 score. Watch to see if Regeneron musters the strength to rise back above the 50-day and 200-day lines, create some space above those key resistance lines, and earnest start forming the right side of a new base pattern.RELATED:How To Invest: Add The 10-Week-Line Pullback To Your Trading PlaybookHow To Invest: The Keys To A Great Cup-With-Handle BaseStock Market Today: Do These 7 Leading Chipmakers Deserve A Spot On Your Watch List?Inside IBD 50: What Do These 5 Big Winners Have In Common?Tech News At IBD: Why Snap Is Getting Some Love On Wall Street

427,CELG,"No. 2 biotech Celgene (CELG) may be getting too reliant on Revlimid for revenue, as the cancer drug accounted for nearly two-thirds of the company's sales in the first quarter, an analyst said Friday.Revlimid, a driver for Celgene, had accounted for an average 62.4% of company sales over the previous four quarters but was up to 64% last quarter, Argus analyst David Toung said in a note to clients.""We are concerned about the risk of revenue concentration from Revlimid,"" he wrote in a note downgrading Celgene shares to hold from buy. ""This drug, a treatment for multiple myeloma and other conditions, accounted for 64% of revenue in Q1 and that proportion is growing.""Part of the problem is that Celgene's total first-quarter sales grew 18% but came in about $80 million light as the company's psoriasis drug, Otezla, faced steep discounting. Celgene said it had lowered the price of Otezla to boost purchases by large institutions, and thus sales of the drug missed views by $95 million.""In other words, the company increased its 'gross-to-net' discounting for Otezla, enabling it to be placed ahead of biologic drugs as a treatment for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis,"" Toung said.Otezla retains some advantage over biologics as an oral solid vs. competitors which are typically infused or injected, he said. Still, the diminishing price for Otezla could have an impact on Celgene's gross margin.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are now ranked No. 20 out of 197 groups tracked. But keeping up with the space can be tricky when a relatively unknown stock like Esperion Therapeutics can rocket nearly 200% in mere months, outplaying leaders like Amgen. Get a better breakdown of the sector on IBD's Technology page.Revlimid's patent in the U.S. is good through 2027, but a settlement in 2015 will allow Natco Pharma to begin selling a generic version in March 2022.In the first quarter, Revlimid sales grew by 20.3%. The company's multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst led the pack in growth, up 33.5%. Otezla was next, up 22.5%, and chemotherapy drug Abraxane, gained 6.1%.On the stock market today, Celgene stock closed down 1.65% to 122.41, hitting a two-month low intraday.RELATED:Did Regeneron, Sanofi Just Launch A Blockbuster Drug?Vertex Big Winner In Biopharma Q1 As AbbVie, AstraZeneca DipCelgene Dips On $95 Million Lag In Psoriasis Sales, But Earnings Top

428,CELG,"X Celgene (CELG) stock toppled for the second day running on Monday after one of its partners, Acceleron Pharma (XLRN), reported first-quarter losses and sales that not only lagged Wall Street but fell 80% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Celgene stock closed 3.3% lower at 118.36 on the stock market today, below the 122.49 entry point of a flat base that began forming in March. Volume was huge, running more than 70% above typical levels.Acceleron stock, too, was down 9.2%, near 28.80. For the quarter, Acceleron reported adjusted losses of 66 cents a share on $3.7 million in sales, compared with 13 cents and $18.2 million a year ago. Analysts had modeled a 54-cent loss on $3.9 million in sales.But those lackluster first-quarter results came two days after Acceleron and Celgene unveiled strong Phase 2 results for a drug dubbed luspatercept in patients with lower-risk bone-marrow disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes, a form of leukemia.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. It underperforms just 4% of all stocks in terms of key growth rates. Who's ranked first in the group?

429,CELG,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

430,CELG," The major indexes eased in dull trading and the Dow Jones industrial average edged barely into positive ground following Emmanuel Macron's win in Sunday's French presidential election that also served as a moral victory for the eurozone.Volume on the U.S. markets was running lower at around 12 p.m. ET vs. the same time Friday.However, even though the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all harbored thin losses of 0.1% to 0.2%, Monday's session was notable in that a handful of highly rated or leadership-quality names fell sharply in heavy volume.Such action forces the decision for an investor to either hold shares, sell half of a current position, or completely sell to lock in gains or cut losses. The five names deserving close watch are Celgene (CELG), Installed Building Products (IBP), mortgage insurance firm Essent Group (ESNT), RV giant Thor Industries (THO), and Argentine oil and gas explorer YPF (YPF).While four of these companies are sinking in heavy volume and testing buying support at the 50-day moving average, Thor Industries had already issued a sell signal after the stock broke below its 50-day line on March 7 in huge volume.In the stock market today, Thor is now testing long-term support at the 200-day moving average. Thor remains in a long-term uptrend since it cleared a 63.09 buy point in a long first-stage base in March 2016. Since then, Thor gained as much as 83%.Installed Building Products, which specializes in insulation, garage doors and rain gutters, continues to sell off after reporting strong results on Friday. Q1 profit jumped 35% to 35 cents a share as revenue grew 33% to $255.7 million. In Q4, EPS jumped 29% and revenue 22%.Yet the stock, down nearly 5% to 49.60, is driving below its 50-day line for the first time since launching out of a seven-month base-on-base pattern with a 44.40 buy point on Feb. 27.YPF, which is actively pursuing fracking opportunities in its home country of Argentina, fell more than 2% to 24.10 in volume running 41% above usual levels. The stock dropped to as low as 23.20, near a recent breakout point of 22.89, but is finding buyers near the 50-day line.YPF, which has a $9.4 billion market cap, appears to be emerging out of a long bottoming-base pattern since peaking at 53.18 all the way back in December 2010. One negative for YPF: Its integrated oil and gas industry group is a laggard in the stock market today, currently ranked 180th, or well within the bottom quartile of IBD's 197 industry groups table.You can see the entire table by going to IBD Data Tables section in the Stock Lists section at Investors.com.Elsewhere, Celgene has surrendered all of its small gains from a Feb. 28 breakout past a 122.49 entry in a sloppy cup-with-handle base. The biotech's partner firm Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) announced Q1 results on Monday and noted it will begin a Phase 3 trial of luspatercept as a first-line treatment for the blood-related disorder MDS in lower-risk patients in early 2018.On the upside, Coach (COH) continued to pose as a strong turnaround in the apparel sector after striking a deal to buy rival Kate Spade (KATE) at a much lower price, 18.50 a share, then what Kate had traded earlier this year. Coach, gapping up to as high as 46.56, retreated a bit after the early-morning buying rush. But at 44.85, the stock was still up more than 5% and extended more than 7% past a 41.80 buy point in a long first-stage saucer with handle.Coach's RS Rating has improved to a 67 on a scale of 1 to 99 from 43 in the prior week. Also, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the up/down volume ratio is now above the neutral 1.0 level, which means that volume on up days in price has now exceeded turnover on down days over the past 50 trading sessions.The Street currently sees Coach's earnings rebounding 8% to $2.14 a share in fiscal 2017, which ends in June, then rising another 11% in FY 2018. Watch to see if the acquisition news spurs a boost in analysts' estimates in the coming weeks or months.RELATED:In Stock Market Today: Coach Rockets; Why Did These 8 Beaten Down Industry Groups Sparkle?In Stock Market Today II: Are Snap, Nvidia Poised To Break Out Soon?In Stock Market Today III: Time To Sell These 5 Small Caps?

433,CELG,"Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) could lead the biotech sector to 15% more upside following the second quarter, an analyst said Thursday as shares trekked up for the fifth straight day.XAt the closing bell on the stock market today, IBD's 432-company Biotech industry group was up 1.3%, trading at a 17-month high. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges credited the lack of drug-pricing headwinds for the five-day uptrend.""The current rally reflects the lifting of perceived fears of pricing regulations, and a favorable tone from the FDA, but does not yet reflect more positive operating results, not to mention industry consolidation, which we still expect,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Porges expects the industry to tack on another 15% upside following what's likely to be a strong second-quarter earnings season. Biotech stocks have added 8% since June 15. On Thursday, leaders included a number of small caps trading below 10.Of the risers, Porges prefers what he calls ""growth stocks"" like Celgene, Regeneron, Vertex and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). Since mid-May, Regeneron stock has added 16%, followed by 14% gains for Celgene and Vertex stock.""Gilead Sciences (GILD) performed the worst with only a 5% gain, which is still higher than the overall market,"" he said. Major biotech indexes have added 9%-14% over the last month as the broader market has only tacked on 2% growth.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts began predicting a biotech rally last month. What were the signs and who will benefit the most? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look.Some analysts have said one reason for the sector's surge is that fears are subsiding over the prospect that President Donald Trump might take action to curb pricing. Some analysts now say that Trump's rhetoric to tamp down pricing appears to be ""lip service.""Wall Street expectations for Amgen (AMGN), Gilead and Regeneron's second-quarter earnings have dipped about 1%-2% over the last month and revenue views have been largely flat with a 1% decline for Amgen and Gilead.Large-cap biotechs will have to beat second-quarter views to gain that 15% upside, Porges said. Over the last five years, large caps have beat second-quarter expectations 60%-100% of the time with Amgen, Celgene and Gilead beating both views every time.Guidance increases are 85% more likely in the second quarter than the first, he said. With that, he expects the biotech sector could rally as much as 35%-50% compared to long-term relative multiples vs. the medtech and pharma sectors.RELATED:Could This Small Biotech Pique Interest Of Gilead And Others?Biotechs Surge As Generalists Return Amid Subsiding Trump WoesThese Biotechs Are Leading The Sector To A 3-Month High Today

434,CELG,"X Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were mixed early Thursday as software and biotech stocks have become key leaders of the ongoing market rally.Oracle (ORCL) surged overnight after its strong earnings report. During the regular session Celgene (CELG) roared into a buy zone, with Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen (BIIB) among peers showing bullish action.Investors should pay attention to sector rotations, because a stock's performance is closely tied to that of its broader industry. Stronger industry-sector performance may reflect improving business conditions for those companies. And there is a momentum shift as markets become more enamored or disenchanted with a group.Nasdaq 100 futures rose more than 0.1% above fair value, though off overnight highs. Futures for the Dow industrials climbed nearly 0.1% while S&P 500 index futures turn slightly higher. Crude oil futures, which have plunged this week, edged up.Over the last five sessions, the Medical-Biomed/Biotech group has been the top performer out of IBD's 197 industry groups, soaring 6.9%. Amgen, Regeneron, Biogen and Celgene are up more than 5% just this week, with Biogen and Regeneron up more than 10%.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is rated No. 1 in IBD's Biomed/Biotech group, with a best-possible 99 Composite Rating. To find out which are the other top-rated biotechs, and how they stack up vs. objective critera, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Several other drug groups are big recent winners, among them the ethical drugs group, which includes Dow stock Merck (MRK).

Merck has a 66.90 conventional buy point with a 65.68 aggressive entry.Meanwhile, IBD's Software-Desktop group, home to Oracle, is the fourth-best industry over the past five days. The Dow's Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Red Hat (RHT) are also members.

Both XBI and IBB broke out of consolidations this week.Oracle reported much-stronger-than-expected earnings late Wednesday, with 3% revenue growth also edging past views. Shares of the business software giant shot up 11% to 51.35 in premarket trading on the stock market today. That would be a record high and well above a 47.09 buy point, though overnight trading doesn't always carry over into the regular session. Still, Oracle already topped an aggressive entry of 46.17 on Wednesday, rising 1.1% to 46.33 in heavy volume.In addition to desktop software names Microsoft, Adobe and Red Hat, which are all near long-time or all-time highs, several other business software stocks have been breaking out and hitting highs in recent months.

436,CELG,"Biotech stocks had their best day since January 2016 as political headwinds subside and generalist investors return to the sector, driving up prices on both big-cap and smaller-name companies, analysts told Investor's Business Daily.A number of companies saw double-digit and high-single-digit gains in share price, helping IBD's 432-company Biotech industry group to rise 8% so far this week. But the pop also offered unique opportunities in specific big-cap biotechs such as Celgene (CELG), which broke out of a flat base that began forming in mid-March after rushing past a 127.74 buy point. Shares jumped 5.2% to close at 132.83.Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay says generalist investors are beginning to return to the sector after departing in 2015 and after the November election, when newly elected President Trump began talking about ways to tamp down on drug prices.Brad Loncar, CEO of Loncar Investments, told IBD earlier this month the biotech sector lost $7 billion in late 2016 following the election. Now, Chattopadhyay says, it appears Trump's plan to control drug prices is mere ""lip service.""""Generalist investors may have under-owned biotech vs. tech and may now be seeking more exposure if the drug-pricing headwinds dissipate,"" he told IBD. ""Also, recall last summer, contrary to expectations, biotechs outperformed.""Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) spiked 19% to 41.02 on the stock market today. Cara Therapeutics (CARA) popped 10%, and topped an 18.93 buy point out of a cup-with-handle that began to form in late March. Blueprint Medicines (BPMC) rose 8.6%.Elsewhere, Exelixis (EXEL) climbed 7.8% to 24.02, nearing a buy point at 24.95 out of a cup that began shaping up in May. Other strong risers included Pacira Pharmaceuticals (PCRX), up 7.7% at 46.90, and Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), up 7.6% at 56.78.IBD'S TAKE: Earlier this week, analysts questioned whether biotechs could be headed for a takeoff following the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, which highlighted cancer-focused companies like Kite Pharma (KITE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE). Head to the Industry Snapshot to get a look at the news that predated this week's pop.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges predicted the resurgence in a note last month, citing more achievable revenue and earnings views heading into the third quarter, as well as the likelihood of subsiding political risks leading generalists back to biotech.""After two years of political anxiety and uncertainty about health care reform, drug pricing restrictions and major federal interventions, we believe the probability of material negative changes is receding,"" he wrote in a May 19 report.Porges models a three- to six-month surge for the biotech sector and sees all stocks in his coverage universe as subject to 25%-30% upside. That predicted jump follows two to three years of ""sideways performance.""On Wednesday, Porges told IBD his predictions from May are coming to fruition. Under new Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the regulatory path is being eased and robust drug launches are underway.Investors are also likely excited for the potential for acquisitions in the space as the likelihood for tax reform looms, he said. On top of that the spike could be the result of ""shorts covering in panic,"" he said.RELATED:These Biotechs Are Leading The Sector To A 3-Month High TodayCan This Cancer Treatment Stock Ride Biotech Boom To New Breakout?This Small Biotech Soared On Its Celgene-Partnered Trial

437,CELG,"Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) stock rebounded Tuesday afternoon after announcing Monday that it's scrapping development of a kidney cancer drug, putting Wall Street focus squarely on a Celgene (CELG)-partnered rare disease drug.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Acceleron stock popped 5% to 29.64, after earlier falling as much as 4.8% to a nearly two-week low. Shares bounded above their 50-day moving average in the afternoon.Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay called Acceleron's kidney cancer drug dalantercept ""a headline risk"" that was unlikely to ""deliver a win for Acceleron."" Late Monday, Acceleron said the drug failed to increase progression-free survival in patients with advanced kidney cancer.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says dalantercept's failure was largely expected given tepid views from Acceleron management. He cut his price target on Acceleron stock to 36 from 54, though remains outperform-rated. Chattopadhyay kept his 37 price target and buy rating.Acceleron's drug, luspatercept, is in trials with Celgene to treat anemia associated with a rare blood disorder and a group of blood cancers called myelodysplastic syndromes. The company is set to report data from two Phase 3 luspatercept trials in mid-2018.IBD'S TAKE: Immuno-oncology drugmakers Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Incyte and Roche were among presenters at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting earlier this month in Chicago. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown of several key trials.""These trials will be pivotal in unlocking the value of luspatercept and the stock towards our price target, and additional upside is possible from (myelodysplastic syndromes) label expansion opportunities,"" Leerink's Porges wrote in a note to clients.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young, too, cut her price target on Acceleron stock to 35 from 46, though she has an outperform rating on shares. She models $2.1 billion in luspatercept sales in 2025 on an unadjusted basis.RELATED:How Celgene Toppled On A Small-Cap Biotech's Ragged QuarterDow's Merck Pauses Cancer Trials To Investigate Keytruda-Tied DeathsThis Small Biotech Soared On Its Celgene-Partnered Trial

438,CELG,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) stock popped on Thursday after the top 10 biotech crushed Wall Street's expectations for first-quarter sales and adjusted profits on growing revenue from the immunosuppressant drug Soliris.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Alexion stock jumped 5.1% to 126.91. Shares topped their 50-day moving average after having traded below that key level of support since mid-March. The stock touched a seven-week high intraday.For the first quarter ended March 31, Alexion reported adjusted income of $1.38 a share on revenue of $870 million, compared with 99 cents and $701.04 million in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had modeled $1.23 a share and $826.63 million in sales.Soliris, Alexion's biggest moneymaker, brought in $783 million in sales, including a $29 million benefit from a change in revenue recognition, growing 17.7% on a year-over-year basis. Removing the adjustment, Soliris grew 13% and topped analysts' view by 2%, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.He kept his outperform rating on Alexion stock.IBD'S TAKE: Alexion has an IBD Composite Rating of 72, meaning it outperforms nearly three in four stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags leading biotech Celgene (CELG) which has a top CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the best-rated biotechs.Alexion noted it has filed applications with the FDA, in Europe and Japan to have Soliris approved as a treatment for an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness. This would be the third disorder for which Soliris is approved in the U.S.The company reiterated its 2017 guidance for $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion in sales and $5.10-$5.30 earnings per share minus certain items. On a year-over-year basis, sales would grow 12% and EPS would be up 13% at the midpoints of the guidance.RELATED:AbbVie Hovers Near Buy Point After Q1 Earnings, Sales TopCelgene Dips On $95 Million Lag In Psoriasis Sales, But Earnings TopAmgen Trips Amid Rivals: Sales Miss By $100 Million, But Earnings Top

440,CELG,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) eczema drug Dupixent outstripped psoriasis drugs from rival companies in fourth-week prescriptions, an analyst wrote Monday, suggesting that 2017 consensus views for the drug are ""beatable.""On Friday, Sanofi said on its earnings call that 2,500 prescriptions had been written by 1,200 physicians in Dupixent's first month on the market. Health care tracker IMS suggests 200 prescriptions were filled in the fourth week after Dupixent's launch.By comparison, 52-60 prescriptions of psoriasis drugs Novartis's (NVS) Cosentyx and Taltz from Eli Lilly (LLY) had been written at this point following their launches. Celgene's (CELG) Otezla had 101 scripts.""The most successful of those drugs has been Otezla, and the fourth week of the Dupixent launch is double the prescription volume for Otezla,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. He also noted two recent successful launches of cholesterol-lowering drugs Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha and Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent saw 72-80 prescriptions.Otezla's estimated monthly net price over that period was $1,600 which is 40% below the likely net price of Dupixent, Porges wrote. Adjusting for only the higher price, Dupixent's 2017 sales would be $115 million based on Otezla's sales record.""However, if Dupixent indeed continues to see double the prescription volume of Otezla, the 2017 revenue could be closer to $230 million, or a 68% beat compared to consensus,"" he said. Though it's early post-launch, ""the information thus far is very encouraging.""IBD'S TAKE: How do you survive investing in a market where a relatively unheard of company like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) can launch nearly 200% in mere months? It's all a matter of identifying the right catalysts, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for more.Based on Sanofi's disclosure of 2,500 written Dupixent prescriptions in the first month, Porges models a 25% fill rate in April growing to a 45% fill rate by December as more payers open up access. That leads to potentially 300 prescriptions filled in the fifth week.This is ""not unreasonable given the prior week-over-week growth of 93 prescriptions,"" Porges said.Analysts broadly model $20 million in Dupixent sales for the second quarter, $48 million in the third, $70 million in the fourth and $137 million for 2017. Porges sees $206 million in Dupixent sales for 2017 growing to $1.13 billion and $3 billion in 2018 and 2019.Comparatively, Otezla and Cosentyx brought in $103 million and $210 million in this first four quarters on the market.""By comparison, Dupixent is more expensive than Otezla, but significantly cheaper than Cosentyx, and is entering a much less competitive category with more untreated patients and what appears to be faster access to major (pharmacy benefit manager) formularies,"" he wrote.Porges reiterated his outperform rating and 448 price target on Regeneron stock. On the stock market today, Regeneron stock was up 2% to 396.17. Sanofi stock fell 0.1% to 47.26.RELATED:Amgen Trumps Regeneron, Sanofi In Post-Trial Cholesterol Drug ScriptsAmgen Payer Pushback Likely To Sting Amid Battle With Regeneron, SanofiRegeneron, Sanofi Get Approval For Eczema Drug Priced At $37,000

441,CELG,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) was the big winner Friday in the wake of a slew of biotechs and drugmakers issuing first-quarter reports Thursday.On the stock market today, Vertex rose 0.75% to 118.30 after climbing as much as 2.6% to its best level since January 2016. Meanwhile, IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group edged higher.Celgene (CELG) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) rose 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively.AbbVie (ABBV) stock dropped below a buy point temporarily achieved Thursday at 66.89. Shares fell 0.2% to 65.94 on Friday. AstraZeneca (AZN) stock fell 2% to 30.250.For Vertex, investors are now keyed in on its triple-pill treatment for cystic fibrosis, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a report Friday. He sees an 80% chance of Vertex successfully bringing the triple-pill regimen to market.IBD'S TAKE: Navigating the biotech trading world can be tricky when relatively unknown names like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) launch nearly 200% in mere months. Head to IBD's Technology page for a primer on the industry and which players look good for 2017.Vertex will decide on the Phase 3 strategy for the triple-regimen in the latter half of 2017. The biotech is currently evaluating four next-generation drugs to be used in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor, two cystic fibrosis drugs.Porges raised his price target to 132 from 128 and kept his outperform rating on Vertex stock. He noted investors likely prodded Vertex stock on its raised 2017 guide for cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco to $710 million to $730 million.In a separate report, Porges boosted his price target on Celgene stock to 146 from 141 and kept his market perform rating. Though a 26% miss in sales of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla led to an overall sales miss, Porges noted catalysts in Celgene's future.""Celgene's portfolio is undoubtedly broader than its peers,' and management appears to be focused on creating long-term shareholder value through a focus on later-stage clinical programs,"" he wrote, noting Celgene has key trials in multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, brain tumors and Crohn's disease.""We have generally been cautious in our view of the several late-stage candidates in Celgene's pipeline; however, we now expect several key inflection points from late-stage candidates in Celgene's pipeline in the next couple of years,"" he said.AbbVie ""bucked the rocky earnings season trend,"" meeting consensus views for first-quarter sales and growing revenue from immunosuppressant Humira by 23% in the U.S., Porges said in another report. Adjusted income beat by 2 cents.""Results from the other biopharma names with drugs in the immuno-oncology market have been volatile with some notable misses mainly attributed to overall market weakness,"" he said. ""AbbVie's result suggests that part of the trend may also come from share loss.""Given the solid performance of Humira, AbbVie's biggest moneymaker, Porges is more constructive on AbbVie's outlook for the year. For the year, AbbVie sees sales topping $2 billion in the U.S.Porges boosted his price target on AbbVie stock to 72 from 71 and kept his market perform rating.RELATED:Acorda Topples To 11-Year Low On Street-Lagging Q1 Sales, LossesAlexion Beats On First-Quarter Sales; Profits Top By 15 Cents

442,CELG,"How do you get a handle on the biotech market when an unknown stock like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) — up nearly 200% since January — outperforms the likes of the industry's top name, Amgen (AMGN)?Sure, Esperion has had some breakthroughs in cholesterol medication. But Amgen recently had its own moment with one of its cholesterol drugs, proving that decreasing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol also cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke. Still, Amgen isn't getting the respect that smaller biotech players are getting, up a comparatively paltry 11% this year.Don't get discouraged, though, analysts say. Just because Amgen isn't getting a lot of love, it doesn't mean other biotech stocks are slouches. It's really a question of navigating what can be a complex sector.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says biotechs have done well since the election, though the stocks are subject to the whims of political debate over drug pricing and health care.""We're worried about Donald Trump and health care reform ... we're worried about FDA reform and now we're worried about drug-pricing regulations,"" he said. ""And it just doesn't seem as though the accumulated worries are going to go away in a hurry.""The overall group, though, looks strong. It's now ranked No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, and four weeks ago it was ranked No. 5.IBD'S TAKE: Among drugmakers, Allergan is sweeping the medical-aesthetics market. But Hologic wants to play. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on that battle.Porges and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed call it a ""stock-pickers market."" Some biotechs are bound to do well in 2017 with a number of catalysts still ahead of them, while others are more likely to struggle with macroeconomics and politics.""There are still some pressures that investors need to be cognitive of, like drug pricing,"" Syed told IBD. ""Some folks thought that was a presidential platform topic, but it keeps coming up now in the postelection.""IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group is up 12% for the year. Major exchange traded funds iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) and the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) are up 12% and 20%, respectively.The top five biotechs include Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN). Each has been in the news in 2017, but none on stock price. Amgen has gained the most at 11% with Gilead lagging, down 6% since January.Syed has buy ratings on Amgen, Celgene and Gilead stocks and a neutral rating on Biogen stock.But the smaller players and potential takeout candidates like Incyte (INCY) and Tesaro (TSRO) have seen big gains on Wall Street. Tesaro is likely to remain a stand-alone company, though, after grabbing FDA approval for ovarian cancer drug, Zejula. Its stock rose as much as 43% through mid-February but is now up only 3% for the year.Incyte, on the other hand, has tacked on 24% since January on rumors that No. 2 biotech Gilead could be looking to acquire it. Incyte would open Gilead up to the oncology world as its hepatitis C franchise struggles amid high cure rates.""Once again, we're starting the year with the best-performing stocks being those that were cheapest and more of takeout candidates,"" Porges told IBD. ""So (making predictions has) definitely been somewhat challenging.""Earlier this month, Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock hit an 11-year high on strong data for a pain pill that could be an alternative to potentially addictive Oxycodone. Nektar stock catapulted 43% in a single day. Shares extended 25% from a cup-with-handle formation in late March, but have since given back 20% of those gains. The stock remains up 58% for the year.Other big stock earners include Kite Pharma (KITE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE), both of which are working on drugs that belong to a class called CAR T-cell therapies. These drugs engineer patients' immune cells to treat cancer. Kite stock is up a whopping 80%, leading a 42% rise in Bluebird stock.And as Esperion rocketed on Amgen's heart study, so too did The Medicines Company (MDCO). Shares are up 45% since January. Porges lists Medicines Co. as a stock to watch, noting its ""spectacular returns.""""If you have the right stock and the right set of events, then you can still generate incredibly attractive returns and that's the excitement of biotech,"" Porges said. ""These are companies that are approaching critical readouts of ongoing development programs where investors think there's a reasonable chance a critical trial or a critical milestone turns out positively.""Mizuho's Syed suggests looking at individual stocks and equities, rather than hoping for a broad biotech resurgence. He sees a ""good number of catalysts"" in 2017 for the market, but notes the drug-pricing debate is likely to still weigh on the market.President Trump has keyed in on the drug-pricing debate and, though limited on details, says he has plans for a competitive-based system that would bring down the prices of drugs. Trump's pick to run the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, has said drug-pricing needs to be more transparent.As that struggle unfolds, Porges laid out some rules for picking biotech stocks likely to have better returns.""You want to be in growth companies early in their life cycle treating very serious illnesses,"" he said. ""And if you follow those three rules, you are generally going to end up with a portfolio that's going to perform better than the average, better than the index, better than the benchmarks.""Under those rules, Porges says Epizyme (EPZM), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are interesting. Epizyme stock is up 44% since January, having topped a 12.70 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation in early February. Vertex stock has gained 23% this year.Alexion stock is actually down 3% year to date, but the stock fits the bill using Porges' rules. The rare-disease company is working on drugs to treat disorders of the central nervous system, blood diseases and genetic disorders.The worst thing to do in biotech investing is to sell just because a stock is up, Porges said. And don't hesitate to buy a stock for the same reason.""One of the axioms of investing in biotech is always you never want to say, 'I'm not going to buy the stock because it's up,' because this is an industry where you can routinely see five-to-tenfold increases in value over the cycle of the emergence of a product,"" he said.""So often we see a stock where investors say, 'It's up 50%, but it's only gone from a $500 million market cap to a $750 million market cap,' which in the scheme of things is pretty small,"" he said. ""If you have a real drug, you're going to be a $5 billion or $6 billion company.""RELATED:Esperion And Medicines Co.

443,CELG,"Corporate earnings results grabbed front and center stage and are helping to propel U.S. equities higher in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, as the major indexes are padding last week's nice gains.The Dow Jones industrial average, boosted by better than expected results in several of its 30 components including Caterpillar (CAT) (Q1 EPS up 100%) and DuPont (DD) (EPS up 30%), rose more than 1.2%. That's better than gains of 0.7% to 0.8% for the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrials, at 21,002, are now up nearly 6.3% since Jan. 1, but the Nasdaq composite, breaking 6000 for the first time, is ahead with a nearly 12% gain. Big-cap techs and select consumer-oriented stocks have helped the Nasdaq's cause. But keep monitoring earnings results and see if more money flows into blue-chip-type large caps outside the tech realm.Caterpillar also notched a surprise 4% gain in revenue, its first year-over-year increase in 10 quarters. The last time the construction and mining gear titan saw a top-line lift came in the third quarter of 2014 (up 1%).Cat shares vaulted past a 99.56 flat-base buy point with a gap up at the open, and it's enjoying heavy institutional buying with shares seeing triple normal turnover. The stock opened the day at 102.80, within the 5% proper buy zone following Tuesday's breakout.The Russell 2000 rallied more than 1.2%. Volume is running firmly higher vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges, a sign of heavy institutional demand for equities.Crude oil futures, meanwhile, rebounded after getting hammered Monday. WTI futures rose 0.9% to $49.67 a barrel but are still down more than 7% year to date.Gold mining stocks and other defensive plays led the market's downside. Newmont Mining (NEM) sank nearly 3% to 32.91 in heavy volume. The mining giant grew first-quarter profit 4% to 25 cents a share on a 13% pickup in revenue.Four months into 2017, it's clear that institutional investors are favoring certain industrial sectors over others. That's good news for stock pickers. Here are five stocks that, in addition to high-growth names in the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders, show more mature fundamentals or are turnaround situations but have the potential to beat the S&P 500. Nvidia (NVDA), $63 billion market value: The leader in graphics processors has stepped nicely into new growth markets including self-driving automobiles, datacenter and AI (artificial intelligence). Nvidia, up nearly 2% to 104.71, is trying to retake its key 50-day moving average near 103 after getting slammed below it on bearish analysts comments on April 1.The stock was a huge leader in 2016, rising 261% from a cup-with-handle breakout at 33.16 back in March that year.Nvidia sports a solid 98 Earnings Per Share Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 and earnings in the April-ending fiscal first quarter are seen rising an impressive 46% to 67 cents a share, on top of the 39% gain in the year-ago quarter. But keep in mind that in the next three quarters, Nvidia faces absolutely steep year-over-year comps, as Q2, Q3, and Q4 profit rose 56%, 104% and 117%, respectively.Given the giant gains in 2016, Nvidia's current correction is very respectable, falling no more than 21% from its all-time high of 120.92.Celgene (CELG), $98 billion market value: The highly respected biotech pioneers treatments for chronic and difficult diseases including multiple myeloma. The stock jumped 2% to 125.87 after finding vital support at the 50-day line. It's up slightly from an earlier 122.49 cup-with-handle entry.The Street sees full-year earnings rising 22% to $7.22 a share in 2017 and up 21% in 2018. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), $13 billion: The former large cap and burrito and taco chain reports Q1 results after the close Tuesday. Watch for an expected positive change in both comparable restaurant sales and see if restaurant-level operating margins show stability or improve.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), $31 billion: The robotic surgery firm, which recently posted double-digit top and bottom-line growth in Q1, is up more than 31% since Jan. 1. It bolted out of a saucerlike base at 727.23 in late February.Intuitive gets a rock-solid 96 Composite Rating in IBD Stock Checkup, among the top 5 in IBD's Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. That group is ranked No. 1 among 197 industry groups and subgroups for six-month relative price performance.Watch for potential new buy points to emerge, in the form of a new base or a gentle pullback to the 10-week moving average, as seen on a weekly chart.In some cases, a stock may not fall back to the 50-day line but find support at the 10-week line. So it's crucial to study a stock's price action on both the daily and weekly charts.RELATED:The Case For A Future New Bull Market In GoldEarnings Results Today: Chipotle Leads 5 Big Reports After The CloseStock Market Today: Is It Time To Buy Hasbro Now?

Shares are forming a flat base with a possible buy point at 127.74.For the first quarter ended March 31, Celgene reported $2.96 billion in sales, up 18% vs. the year-earlier period, but that lagged the consensus for $3.04 billion. Adjusted profits of $1.68 per share climbed 27% and topped views by 5 cents.Among its key products, multiple myeloma drugs Pomalyst and Imnovid grew 33% to $364 million in sales. Cancer drugs Revlimid and Abraxane grew 20% to $1.88 billion in sales and 5% to $236 million, respectively.Otezla, a drug for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, grew 24% to $242 million in sales. But that lagged analysts for $337 million, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed noted in a research report.

Head to the Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News Page for the freshest news.""The company cited market contractions in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the U.S., increased gross to net adjustments and a small inventory drawdown,"" for the first-quarter miss in Otezla sales.

449,CELG,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) is aiming to save $21 million annually by cutting loose 20% of its workforce, the drugmaker said after a judge invalidated four patents protecting multiple sclerosis drug Ampyra.But the cuts could have been — and still might be — much deeper, Janney analyst Ken Trbovich wrote in a note to clients Thursday. He cut his price target on Acorda stock to 18 from 19, but kept his neutral rating on shares.""Acorda has previously spoken of a cost-saving contingency plan that would be enacted if Ampyra's long-term patent protection was lost,"" he said, adding he had ""assumed the first round of cuts would be deeper and a second round could come around the time of the generic launch next year.""Wall Street has long suspected companies like Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) are waiting in the wings to make a copy of Ampyra. Ampyra is approved to improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis. It brought in $493 million in net 2016 sales.Trbovich estimates 120 of Acorda's 597 employees, as of Feb. 20, will be laid off within the month. Acorda said the majority of the head count reduction would take place in April with an expected $8 million in severance and related costs.Layoffs are not expected in the 100-person sales force, Trbovich said. The cuts are disproportionately expected to effect the research and development department. Restructuring is expected to save $5.25 million every three months beginning in the second quarter.Restructuring will allow Acorda to refocus on Parkinson's disease drugs CVT-301 and tozadenant. Acorda will also work to push Ampyra 10-milligram extended-release pills through July 2018, when they lose patent protection.""Over the last several years, we have strategically diversified our portfolio and we believe that CVT-301 and tozadenant can be a platform for significant future growth,"" Chief Executive Ron Cohen said in a news release.IBD'S TAKE: Acorda Therapeutics has an IBD Composite Rating of 14, meaning it underperforms more than eight in 10 of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. A better-rated leader would be Celgene with a top-of-the-class CR of 99. Find the best picks on Stock Checkup.Acorda plans to update its 2017 financial guidance during the first-quarter earnings conference call on April 27.At the close on the stock market today, Acorda stock was flat, at 17.05, after five days in the red.In similar news, Biogen (BIIB) recently won an interference case vs. Forward Pharma (FWP) over MS drug Tecfidera.

"
450,CELG,"Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR), Forward Pharma (FWP) and Biogen (BIIB) stocks continued to feel the fallout Monday of several FDA and district court decisions regarding multiple sclerosis drugs Tecfidera and Ampyra.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Acorda stock plunged 12.4% to 18.40. The stock dive followed a judge's decision Friday to toss out four of five patents covering MS drug Ampyra.Alkermes (ALKS), which manufactures Ampyra for Acorda and gets an 18% royalty on global sales, saw shares topple 1.9% to close at 57.42 in response. Analysts are a bit more bullish on Alkermes stock, though, noting that the drug Vivitrol, a treatment for opioid dependence, is ""underappreciated.""Biogen stock was down a fraction to 272.69, though it won Friday in an interference case vs. Forward. Biogen is likely to feel competitive pressure from Roche (RHHBY), which won FDA approval for its drug Ocrevus in two types of MS.Forward stock skidded by 8.3% to 19.73 Monday. Shares touched an 11-week low and remained well below their 50-day moving average for the seventh consecutive day.The likelihood of Acorda winning an appeal is slim, Janney analyst Ken Trbovich said. Timing for the appeal is about 12 to 18 months, meaning a decision could come around the time the remaining patent on Ampyra is set to expire.Two generic versions of Ampyra have already received approval, with six others grabbing tentative approval, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients. Now, Acorda is prepping to cut spending.Analysts expect Acorda to turn to Parkinson's as its next big sector. Acorda has a pair of drugs, known as CVT-301 and tozadenant, that are now its first and second priorities, Matteis said. Acorda plans to file for approval of CVT-301 by the end of the second quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen spinoff, Bioverativ, says it's not a typical biotech startup. Why? Head to The New America for the breakdown.""The good thing for investors: Approval of CVT-301, after clean long-term safety data, now looks fairly de-risked in our view,"" Matteis said. He expects approval in 2018 and sees tozadenant coming out with strong topline Phase 3 data in the first quarter of 2018.CVT-301 and tozadenant are expected to have an overlapping prescriber base.Trbovich downgraded Acorda stock to neutral from a buy rating. He has a price target of 19 on the stock. Matteis kept his market-perform rating on Acorda stock and an outperform rating on Alkermes stock.Biogen may have won its case against Forward, but it looks likely to struggle against Roche and Celgene (CELG), Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. Biogen gets a royalty on sales of Roche's Ocrevus, but Ocrevus will probably swipe some share from Biogen's Tecfidera.Tecfidera accounted for 76% of Biogen's sales in 2016, including half of all MS drug sales, and is expected to bring in 78% of total sales in 2017. But Tecfidera is only approved to treat relapsing-remitting MS. Ocrevus is approved in relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms.""While Biogen stands to gain from their royalties on Ocrevus, particularly from incremental revenue in (primary progressive MS), it also stands to lose revenue and profits in (relapsing-remitting MS) from the cannibalization of its existing products,"" Porges wrote in a report.The primary progressive MS market is small, about 10,000 treated patients vs. 300,000 in the relapsing-remitting MS market. Biogen has a leading 40% share of the relapsing-remitting market.""Our scenario suggests that the (primary progressive MS) market is too small and Biogen's royalty too low, to offset the profit erosion that Ocrevus will cause to Biogen's existing brands in the (relapsing-remitting MS) market,"" Porges said.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on its own MS drug, ozanimod. The drug is currently in Phase 3 testing.Investment bank Jefferies kept its hold rating on Biogen stock, but downgraded Forward stock to a hold rating from buy. Forward had been slated to receive royalties on Tecfidera sales in the U.S., but that ""hinged on a positive outcome in the interference (case).""RELATED:Acorda, Forward Stocks Plunge On Multiple Sclerosis Court RulingsRoche Multiple Sclerosis Drug OK Bittersweet For Beleaguered Biogen

454,CELG,"AbbVie (ABBV) stock rocketed to an eight-month high and hovered around a breakout Thursday after the top 10 drugmaker reported first-quarter sales and profits that topped Wall Street's expectations.On the stock market today, AbbVie rose 1.6% to 66.07, closing below a 66.89 buy point of a flat base that began in mid-March. Shares rose as high as 67.50 intraday.For the first quarter ended March 31, AbbVie reported adjusted income of $1.28 a share on $6.54 billion in sales, up a respective 11.3% and 9.7% vs. the year-earlier period. Analysts had modeled $1.26 a share and $6.48 billion in sales.Sales of the immunosuppressant Humira, AbbVie's biggest moneymaking drug, grew 15.1% to $4.12 billion. Humira sales were 1% above consensus views for $4.092 billion and in line with Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges' $4.118 billion view.""The pricing and volume challenges noted by biopharma companies with immunology drugs do not seem to have impacted Humira to the same degree which suggests to us Humira's formulatory position has remained largely unchanged and reduces the risk of subsequent revenue misses in 2017,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) first-quarter report was expected to have highlighted ""multiple issues"" for biotechs and drugmakers. But on Thursday, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also delivered across-the-board beats. Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on J&J's results.Porges kept a market perform rating on AbbVie stock.Imbruvica, a cancer drug, brought in $551 million in sales, up 44.7% on a year-over-year basis. In the U.S., Imbruvica brought in $457 million, in line with consensus views for $459 million, though 6% below Leerink's forecast, Porges wrote in a note to clients.AbbVie note the FDA accepted an application for Imbruvica as a treatment in graft-versus-host disease during the quarter. Graft-versus-host disease can occur when foreign tissue is introduced into the body via organ transplants. The drug is being developed with Johnson & Johnson.The company later confirmed its 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings of $5.44-$5.54 a share, up 13.9% at the midpoint of guidance.Also Thursday, Celgene (CELG) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, but sales came out short. Fellow biotech giant Amgen (AMGN) beat on earnings, missed on revenue late Wednesday.

456,CELG,"Wall Street will be keyed in Tuesday to Biogen's (BIIB) earnings for a first look at whether payer pushback hindered sales of Spinraza, the first drug approved for spinal muscular atrophy, which goes for $125,000 per treatment.A Mizuho survey of 67 investors found that the Street generally expects Biogen to pull in $16 million in U.S. Spinraza sales for the first quarter and $186 million for the full year. That would be just a 6% chunk of projected total sales for the period.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Spinraza coverage should have been a slam-dunk. But the $125,000 price per treatment — $750,000 in the first year and $375,000 in subsequent years — has payers balking, according to numerous reports.Though Spinraza is approved for three types of spinal muscular atrophy, most payers are just covering the most severe form. The disease affects primarily infants and children, and causes muscle weakness and wasting.Investors polled by Mizuho expect Spinraza to bring in $2.1 billion in peak worldwide sales. If Spinraza sales miss in the first quarter but show ""solid"" underlying demand for the drug, 68% of investors polled said they'd buy the stock.Biogen is set to report its first-quarter earnings before the markets open Tuesday. For that period, analysts expect Biogen to report $2.74 billion in sales and $5 adjusted earnings per share, up 0.4% and 4.4% respectively.Shares of Biogen have been consolidating since August. The stock has traded below its 50-day moving average since March 28. On the stock market today, Biogen ticked up 0.2% to close at 272.94.Early Thursday, fellow biotechs Celgene (CELG) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are set to announce their quarterly reports. Intraday, Celgene was down a fraction, near 122.35, as Alexion stock fell 1.7%, near 116.70.Celgene investors will look for strong sales of Revlimid, Pomalyst and Otezla — Celgene's biggest moneymakers — and potentially more commentary on ozanimod, a multiple-sclerosis drug in Phase 3 trials likely to rival Novartis' (NVS).IBD'S TAKE: You've read about biotechs and drugmakers, but what about the cloud services company that provides the backbone for their clinical studies. Head to The New America for more on Veeva Systems (VEEV) which, on Thursday, saw its stock hit a record high.In 2016, chemotherapy drug Revlimid brought in 62.4% of Celgene's total products sales, growing 20.2%. The FDA and the European Commission recently approved Revlimid as a maintenance treatment for patients with multiple myeloma, after a stem-cell transplant.The Street could also look for commentary on Abraxane, a chemotherapy drug often used in combination trials. A recent trial, however, using Oncomed's (OMED) demcizumab and Abraxane in pancreatic cancer failed to meet its primary endpoint.For the first quarter, analysts broadly expect Celgene to report $1.64 adjusted earnings per share on $3.04 billion in sales, up 24.2% and 21.1% respectively vs. the year-earlier period.When Alexion reports early Thursday, investors will look for strength in sales of Soliris, an immunosuppressant approved to treat two immune system disorders — one which destroys red blood cells and the other which causes the formation of excess blood clots.Alexion has three drugs approved. Soliris makes up the lion's share of sales, bringing in 92.2% of revenue in 2016. Alexion is working to expand approvals for Soliris and just submitted applications in the U.S. and Japan to use Soliris to treat an autoimmune neuromuscular disease.In March, UBS analyst Martin Auster called Alexion stock one to watch as the sector recovers in 2017. But Alexion stock is down 2.9% for the year and has traded below its 50-day moving average since mid-March.For the quarter, analysts call for Alexion to report 18% year-over-year sales growth to $827.2 million and $1.23 a share in adjusted earnings, up 1% vs. last year.RELATED:How Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsDow's Johnson & Johnson Highlights 'Multiple Issues' For Drugs, BiotechsWhich Biotechs Are Buyable As Sector Recovers In 2017?

457,CELG,"The biotech boom peaked in July 2015, and as the industry slowly recovers from its slump one of the biggest biotech ETFs is looking more attractive.SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) is trading near 52-week highs, approaching a potential buy point of 72.68 in a flat base. The ETF has moved back above its 50-day moving average in the past couple of weeks, which strengthens its chart.IBD's biotech industry group has been in the top 15 of 197 groups for many weeks, reflecting the industry's comeback. Yet, it is still short on stocks with superior fundamentals that are near proper buy points. Even many of the stocks with high IBD Composite Ratings are low-priced stocks or otherwise lacking. A few are still unprofitable companies.The SPDR Biotech ETF, though, provides a way to invest in the sector's broad advance without having to find specific stocks. Buying the index also can provide some buffer against company-specific risks, which can be big in biotechs. Poor clinical trials or a rejected drug application are risks on top of the usual investor worries such as earnings reports.The fund owns about 90 stocks, including industry heavyweights such as Biogen (BIIB), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Amgen (AMGN). But some of the largest holdings in terms of portfolio weight are small-cap or midcap companies such as Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) and Exelixis (EXEL). On Tuesday, Exelixis broke out of a base but retreated right back below the 23.59 buy point the next day.The ETF selects stocks mainly on revenue, but earnings and ""market perception"" are also considered, according to the prospectus. All stocks are picked from the S&P Total Market Index, a broad domestic gauge, and must have a market capitalization above $500 million and certain liquidity ratio requirements. The average weighted market cap is about $17 billion.SPDR S&P Biotech rose more than 20% in the first three months of 2017. It has an average annual gain of 13.9% the past three years and 21.3% the past five years.That compares favorably to iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), another widely held ETF. That fund rose about 12% in the first quarter, and the three-year average return is 7.6% and the five-year average return is 19.2%. The iShares biotech ETF is more heavily weighed on the industry giants.The industry outlook is difficult to measure. Much of it depends on new drugs hitting the market, and there's been pressure on drugmakers to cut prices on some costly medicines.""Growth prospects for the sector have been in decline and the drug pricing debate is extremely difficult to handicap,"" Jonathan Golub, chief equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said of the health care sector in a report last Monday.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

458,CELG,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Celgene (CELG) stocks rocketed Thursday after the biotechs reported Q3 metrics that swept Wall Street's expectations and upped 2016 earnings guidance.Bristol-Myers stock rose 5.4% to close at 51.96 on the stock market today, while Celgene stock jumped 6.4% to 104.72, following the Q3 announcements. Fellow biotech Alexion (ALXN), which also reported Thursday, surged 8% to almost 131.37.For Q3, Bristol-Myers reported $4.9 billion in sales and 77 cents earnings per share ex items, up a respective 21% and 97% vs. the year-earlier period. The consensus of analysts polled by FactSet had expected $4.79 billion and 65 cents.U.S. sales drove Bristol-Myers' quarter, growing 36% year over year vs. 5% growth in worldwide revenue. By drug, cancer med Opdivo led Bristol-Myers' Q3 pipeline with $920 million in sales, more than tripling the year-ago figure.Opdivo treats nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and competes against Merck's (MRK) Keytruda. European regulators recently approved Opdivo to treat adults with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and, in the U.S., Bristol-Myers is looking to use Opdivo to treat unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.Bristol-Myers also boosted its 2016 guidance to $2.80-$2.90 EPS ex items and expects worldwide revenue to grow by a high-teens percentage. It introduced 2017 guidance at $2.85-$3.05 EPS ex items, ""helping to alleviate nervousness going into 2017,"" Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote in a research note.IBD'S TAKE: Political angst has drawn down on biotechs with IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group falling to No. 21 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 9 just four weeks ago. Keep an eye on IBD's ETFs & Funds section for potentially hot sectors.For Q3, Celgene reported $1.58 EPS ex items on $2.98 billion in sales, topping the consensus of 27 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $1.48 and $2.84 billion. On a year-over-year basis, both metrics grew by 28%.Chemotherapy drug Revlimid drove the lion's share of Celgene's sales, bringing in $1.89 billion in revenue, up 30% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Revlimid sales topped consensus expectations by $147 million and were driven by new patient gains, Scotti wrote in a separate report.Revlimid is being examined in the U.S. as a maintenance treatment for newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who've already received an autologous stem-cell transplant. European regulators are due to make a decision on whether to review Revlimid for NDMM in the first half of 2017.Growth was stoutest in Q3 for Otezla, Celgene's drug to treat psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases. Otezla brought in $275 million, growing 98% year over year. Otezla growth was driven by market share gains and increased prescriber adoption, the company said.Otezla beat U.S. sales expectations by $9 million, but that was almost completely offset internationally where sales missed broad analysts' views by $8 million, Scotti wrote.Celgene also updated its 2016 guidance to $11.2 billion in sales which includes a $7 billion contribution from Revlimid, and $5.88-$$5.92 EPS minus items. For 2017, Celgene sees $12.7 billion to $13 billion in sales with Revlimid topping $8 billion, and $6.75-$7 EPS minus items.RELATED:Alexion Crushes Q3 Expectations; Stock Bounds On Drug Trial PlansCelgene Pitted Against Gilead, Biogen In Crohn's Drug BattleCan These Top 5 Biotechs Climb Q3 'Wall Of Worry'?

459,CELG,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) topped Wall Street's Q3 expectations early Thursday and announced its plan to begin enrolling patients in two new drug trials this quarter — sending the stock bounding to a month-high.The stock jumped 8% to close at 131.37 on the stock market today. Shares of fellow biotechs Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Celgene (CELG) jumped, too, on across-the-board Q3 beats. Bristol-Myers rose 5.4% to 51.96, and Celgene climbed 6.4% to 104.72.For Q3, Alexion reported $799 million in sales and $1.23 earnings per share ex items, up 20% and 14%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet, which modeled $786.9 million and $1.17.Soliris, used to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), brought in the lion's share of Alexion's sales at $729 million, up 9.5% vs. last year. That topped consensus views for $725.7 million, RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis said.Hypophosphatasia (HPP) drug Strensiq also beat the consensus with $60.1 million in sales, beating the consensus for $51.7 million, Simeonidis wrote in a research report. That compares with Strensiq's launch when it pulled in $357,000 in Q3 2015.Kanuma, a drug to treat patients with lysosomal acid lipase deficiency, fell just below expectations with $9 million in sales vs. consensus views for $9.3 million, Simeonidis wrote. Kanuma was approved late last year and, in Q3 2015, it pulled in $30,000 in sales.Simeonidis kept his outperform rating on Alexion stock.Alexion also raised its full-year guidance to the upper end of $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion, and the top side of $4.50-$4.65 EPS minus items. Soliris sales guidance was reiterated at $2.835 billion to $2.875 billion. Metabolic sales franchise views were lifted to $225 million to $235 million.In Q4, it will begin enrolling patients in trials for ALXN-1210, an immunosuppressant that, like Soliris, could be used to treat PNH and aHUS.IBD'S TAKE: Eyeing the right biotech takes more than just an investment in earnings growth.

Volume was higher across the board vs. the same time Tuesday. The Dow futures had plunged as much as 800 points Wednesday night.Steel, medical and drug stocks led the upside in the stock market today, while hospitals, solar and automakers underperformed.

The stock is still below its 50-day moving average, which it breached Nov. 1. It's just shy of a 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point first cleared Sept. 14. The iPhone maker, as well as other tech companies including Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), could benefit from Donald Trump's cash repatriation proposal, if Congress permits.

461,CELG,"An election year has added to the pressures that hit biotechnology stocks hard, but a look under the hood of two sibling biotech ETFs is revealing. It shows the more speculative companies in this extremely heterogeneous industry caused much of the hurt.BioShares Biotechnology Products (BBP) is down 1.4% year to date through Oct. 20 and invests in established companies that have brought at least one drug to market.The 35 stock holdings in this exchange traded fund include Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron (REGN).IBD'S TAKE: The largest, cap-weighted biotech ETFs stand to benefit most if these five top companies climb the ""wall of worry"" that has built around the industry.BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC) is down 31.0% so far in 2016 and invests in young and smaller companies whose drugs are in the experimental-testing stage.Its portfolio includes Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), whose shares rocketed in September after the FDA approved its drug to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. That approval means Sarepta will move to the BBP portfolio when the two BioShares ETFs next rebalance in December.This ETF pair allows investors to decide ""how much to mix,"" in terms of combining more-risky with less-risky biotechs, said Paul Yook, founder of BioShares.BBP's focus on household names makes it a relatively less volatile fund. In contrast, BBC holds the riskiest biotechs — highflying companies whose shares could double or triple overnight, and may crash and burn just as well.Yook describes BBP and BBC as the only exchange traded funds to separate clinical-trial companies and product companies into two distinct and stand-alone investments.Investors don't seem much enamored with the idea of custom-tailoring risk. The funds are extremely small and thinly traded, nearly two years after their debut. They have, however, seen a combined $5.8 million in net inflow over the first three quarters of 2016.The BBP fund is the best performer among biotech ETFs so far this year, and BBC the worst.Meanwhile, bellwether iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) has given up 20.8% year to date and sits 21% below its December high.Biotechnology ETFs crumbled over the past year, coming under pressure from lackluster earnings as well as negative scrutiny for health care peers Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Mylan (MYL) in a politically charged season.Despite the ""wall of worry"" around this industry group, at least one analyst has a favorable outlook for biotechs after the Nov. 8 presidential elections.Yook points out another promising sign: a pickup in M&A, with mouthwatering sticker prices for target companies. Allergan (AGN) announced in September that it would acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for roughly $639 million — a 159% premium per share.Biotechs are attractively priced too. This is one rare corner of the stock market where valuations are cheaper than they have been historically, Yook told IBD in a phone interview.While many ETF investors are waiting to buy biotechnology stocks until after the November election, he believes the fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency is priced in.The Democratic presidential contender's remarks on drug price-gouging had triggered sharp biotech declines.Yook added: ""Most of the political scrutiny will be faced by specialty pharmaceutical companies such as Valeant, Mylan and Horizon (HZNP), which our BioShares funds avoid.

462,CELG,"What are ETF investors fretting about these days? A whole lot, but mostly over the stubborn fact that there are few bargains to be had across the broad U.S. stock market and broad fixed income market.""I have been confronted in almost every client conversation I have with stories about soaring high valuations,"" said Martin Small, head of U.S. iShares exchange traded funds at BlackRock. ""Nothing is cheap.""ETF investors can borrow from the popular ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy to find value investments, he told IBD in a phone interview. The Dogs theory recommends investing annually in the 10 highest-yielding companies of the blue-chip index. The thinking is that these ""dogs"" may be oversold and likely to rebound in price.Research shows this strategy outperforms the overall stock market in the long term. It has inspired several ETFs including ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs (SDOG).Small believes investors may be rewarded with a similar-but-different approach using ETFs. It takes advantage of the granular exposure to specific regions and industries that ETFs offer. The goal is to find the ""Dogs of ETFs"" that have sold off irrationally but offer value relative to the market. This is what the process involves, using iShares ETFs as an example:Screen the list of funds using price returns rather than dividend yield as the traditional Dogs strategy and Dogs-based funds do. The poorest performers will include funds that are cheap or oversold. Some of these may offer an attractive opportunity.Small suggests investors evaluate the performance of funds over both the shorter term (year-to-date, for example) and longer periods (one, three and five years).For example, here's what investors can learn looking at the current iShares ETF dogs. The 25 worst-performing iShares ETFs year to date show two broad areas that have been beaten down: foreign developed markets and health care.Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) crumbled 27% through Nov. 3. and iShares MSCI Europe Financials (EUFN) 11%. Over the same period, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV), which tracks the broad U.S. stock market, advanced 4%.To Small, IBB seems oversold for a sector with favorable intellectual properties and strong sales. The fund's 181 stock holdings include Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen (BIIB).Its negative trend coincided with scrutiny of drug pricing ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election. That could mean a rally is in store for drugmakers after the political risks abate.In the case of EUFN, a turnaround is likely to depend on monetary policy having its desired effects. It has 30% of its assets in the U.K., where Brexit continues to cause uncertainty, and 5% in Italy, embroiled in bank loan troubles.It's important to look at how long the fund declined, as well as how fast and deep that decline was. ""Factors such as magnitude and speed (of decline) are additional pieces of information that can help you round out the story and decide if this is an opportunity you want to tap,"" Small said.The idea behind this type of analysis is to decide whether the ETF losers were unduly punished, as well as when they might revert to what is more attractive or normal.""Some of these incredibly sold off investments might return very quickly (to the mean) and others might take a very long period of time,"" Small said, adding value investing often requires patience.That's why he suggests value investors should not only ask ""How much is that dog?"" but also think about how long it might take to get the dog trained.Put your ETF dogs in the opportunistic sleeve of your portfolio. That's the one you carve apart from your core holdings for higher growth investments.""To the extent you need to take higher risk, it's best to do it with a strategy that does some type of value seeking,"" Small said. In other words, do what is hard for most fund investors. Buy low and sell high.It's the opposite of the buy-high-and-sell higher strategy that CAN-SLIM investors know and love.The value of the ""Dogs of ETFs"" approach is that it requires investors to understand the underlying drivers of the portfolio holdings, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of funds research at CFRA. Basically, it makes investors buy an ETF looking forward, not backward.He considers past performance to be of limited value in predicting future performance in ETF investing.""You should not chase winners and you should not discard losers without understanding why those ETFs have performed the way they have,"" he said. ""An ETF performing well is not relevant to whether it can continue to rise.""An index-based ETF merely reflects the performance of the market it targets. Unlike the case with active mutual funds, index fund managers have no control over the stocks in the portfolio.Related:'Dogs' ETF Hits Record High With Dividend Portfolio

463,CELG,"Celgene (CELG), the No. 3 biotech by market cap, could rival Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Galapagos (GLPS), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) with a Crohn's disease drug that topped efficacy expectations, the company said Sunday — prompting a boost in shares on Monday.In the stock market today, Celgene stock lifted 1.2% to 99.64, after briefly slipping to a three-month low below 98. Shares are down 18% this year. RBC analyst Michael Yee says politics are tamping down biotech stocks.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were the worst-performing group last Wednesday, as Supernus Pharmaceuticals and Prothena stocks toppled. Keep tabs on Industry Themes for your best stock bets.But Yee is bullish on GED-0301, Celgene's drug to combat Crohn's. In a recent study of 52 patients, GED-0301 showed improvements in CDAI (Crohn's disease activity index) and in SES-CD (simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease).Wall Street's eyes were more tuned to the latter. By week 12 of the trial, 37% of patients showed at least a 25% reduction in SES-CS, which would be a clinically meaningful endoscopic improvement, says Yee. By the CDAI metric, 67% showed a response and 48% were in remission by week 12.""This 37% is good and higher than expected, as our doctor expert said before the data that 25% of patients achieving this would be good, particularly as a convenient oral drug,"" Yee wrote in a research report Monday.Gilead's and Galapagos' filgotinib is in Phase 3 testing. Phase 2 didn't look at the SES-CD endpoint, so it can't be compared with Celgene's GED-0301, Yee wrote. J&J's Stelara showed the same improvement in 48% of patients at week eight, but that study included a placebo.Biogen also has MT-1301, a drug to treat inflammatory bowel disorder, going into Phase 3 testing. Crohn's as well as ulcerative colitis are both major categories of inflammatory bowel disorder.Yee models GED-0301 adding $1 billion to $2 billion in sales over time for Celgene, as the world moves to pills to treat Crohn's. J&J's Stelara is an injection.""We believe Celgene's promising early endoscopic improvements will get better over time and GED-0301 could be the Otezla of Crohn's disease — meaning even if not the most potent drug, it can still be a $1 billion-plus drug for Celgene if well tolerated, good safety, convenient, and good efficacy,"" he wrote.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young models $2.3 billion in peak sales for GED-0301. She has a 140 price target and outperform rating on Celgene stock. The next catalyst for Celgene stock will likely be when the firm presents 52-week data in 2017, Young said.""This will provide important clues around sustainability of mucosal healing,"" she wrote in her research report. ""Though seeing effects early is positive.""Some have suggested mucosal healing should be a therapeutic endpoint of testing for Crohn's drugs. Mucosal healing, or endoscopic remission, is associated with increased rates of clinical remission, according to the National Library of Medicine.RELATED:Celgene Among Biotechs That Could Top 'Wall Of Worry'Trio Of New Celegene Drugs Could Bring $3 Billion-Plus

465,CELG,"XNo. 2 drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) is angling to take on biotechs Celgene (CELG), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Kite Pharma (KITE) with a treatment for a type of leukemia in partnership with French pharmaceutical Servier.On Thursday, Servier announced the FDA had granted its application with Pfizer to begin developing a drug known as UCART19, a treatment for the blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma causes certain white blood cells to be overproduced in the bone marrow, inhibiting the production and spread of normal red and white blood cells, according to EMedicine.com. The disease largely inflicts children.Pfizer and Servier's UCART19 belongs to a class of drugs that help the immune system identify a specific protein on cancer cells, thus allowing the immune system to destroy the cancer. The engineered immune-system cells are grown in a lab and then infused in a patient.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene could be nearing a breakout on its breakthrough technologies. Head to IBD Stock Analysis for a breakdown of the company's strong growth.Last week, Juno was forced to end its trial to treat the disease. Juno has plans to test a new drug next year in a partnership with Celgene. Meanwhile, Kite is testing a drug known as KTE-C19 in the same disease.In late trading on the stock market today, Pfizer stock was up a fraction, near 34. Kite stock lifted 6%, near 80.50, after announcing on Wednesday a public offering of common stock at 75 a share. Juno stock was up 2.4%, near 22.50, helping prompt a 1.8% jump in Celgene stock, which was above 125.RELATED:Celgene May 'Unveil' Breakthrough Treatment - And Breakout MoveJuno Tanks On Ended Leukemia Trial; Rival Kite Topples On Downgrade

468,CELG,"President Trump railed against ""outrageous"" drug prices Monday, sending biotech and pharma stocks reeling midday Tuesday, but it appears the GOP bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare doesn't touch pharmaceuticals.Although the newest iteration of the American Health Care Act doesn't mention how Trump plans to curb spiraling drug prices, his speech Monday sent IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group into a tailspin, dropping 3.4% to a two-month low.Among generic drugmakers, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) stock sank 6.4% on the stock market today, and Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) tumbled 7.1%, while Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS) dipped 0.55% and Ani Pharmaceuticals (ANIP) lost 0.5%.IBD's 421-company Biomed/Biotech industry group crashed a collective 4.4% with La Jolla Pharmaceutical (LJPC), Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) and Kite Pharma (KITE) stocks down particularly hard, respectively losing 12.6%, 9.3% and 9.8%.Among specialty drugmakers, Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP) fell 1.5%, Mallinckrodt (MNK) dropped 5.1% and Depomed (DEPO) toppled 4.1%.Trump's unspecified plan calls for ""bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process,"" the president said late Monday during a rally in Kentucky.""Medicine prices will be coming way down — way, way, way down — and that's going to happen fast,"" he said. ""We're just adding that to the bill. I said, 'We've got to add that to the bill.' ""He called the cost of medicine in the country ""outrageous,"" saying it's ""many times higher than in some countries in Europe and elsewhere.""IBD'S TAKE: Drug approvals slumped in 2016, but at least three companies added two new drugs to their wheelhouses. See which ones at IBD Industry Themes.""Somebody is getting very rich,"" he said. He later commented that if drug prices aren't included in first version of the American Health Care Act, legislation addressing the drug issue will follow closely after.Trump has had a love-hate relationship with drugmakers. Early in his presidency, he called for drugmakers to lower their pricing. Later, in a meeting with CEOs from Celgene (CELG), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and others, he pledged to cut FDA regulations to speed the drug approval process.Last week, Trump unveiled his ""Blueprint"" for 2018, which proposes increasing user fees collected by the FDA from drugmakers to more than $2 billion.

470,CELG,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are chipping away at AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira sales, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday after AbbVie missed Q3 expectations Friday, primarily on declining Humira sales.Divan downgraded AbbVie stock to neutral and cut his price target to 60 from 70. He models immunosuppressant Humira pulling in $18.1 billion in 2018 sales, declining to $11.3 billion and $5.2 billion in 2022 and 2025, respectively.Humira accounted for 63% of AbbVie sales in Q3. The drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and irritable bowel disorder — markets where branded rivals are already on the market and biosimilars are pressuring AbbVie's patent on Humira.AbbVie is working to protect that patent, but Divan expects Amgen (AMGN) and others to have biosimilars on the market by 2022.""Whether it is in 2020, 2021, 2022 or some other year, at some point Humira will start to decline,"" Divan wrote in his research report. To cope with Humira's decline (it missed Q3 expectations by $100 million), AbbVie has eight late-stage drugs capable of bringing in $25 billion to $30 billion in combined sales.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie's earnings have grown an average 20% over the past five quarters, but have also declined for the last three periods. Get the full scoop in IBD's Income Investor.Pfizer, Eli Lilly/Incyte (INCY) and Gilead are all working on a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors that could compete in arthritis.Celgene (CELG), Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly have IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors for psoriasis, and all three expected to become blockbuster drugs within five years of their launches.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) already has a JAK inhibitor and is in the IL-23 field. AbbVie has its own IL-23 drug in development, but ""it will be entering into a crowded market where it will have more competitive and pricing challenges,"" said Divan.In the irritable bowel disorder market, Celgene's mongersen and ozanimod could put pressure on Humira sales as soon as 2020-22, Divan wrote.But UBS analyst Marc Goodman says the pressure on AbbVie stock is overdone. Shares touched a seven-month low Friday after AbbVie reported its Q3 earnings, which fell 6.2%. In the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 3.2% to 55.78.Goodman kept his buy rating and 73 price target on AbbVie stock, though the company's 2017 earnings guidance for 13%-15% growth in 2017 implied $4.43-$5.53, which was lower than Wall Street's $5.62 view.Still, Goodman wrote that ""based on management's commentary on Humira volume and pricing, we think the concerns appear overdone. The earnings for next year are a little light, but we think the investment in the pipeline should drive growth in the longer term.""RELATED:Eli Lilly, AbbVie Top 2017 Rankings; Pfizer, AstraZeneca Flailing

471,CELG,"IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group dropped 8% over the past three weeks, but RBC analyst Michael Yee expects stocks to rally, despite lackluster Q3 earnings, after the election season wraps.The sector still has nearly four weeks of ""choppiness"" before the Nov. 8 election, and recent blowouts have had some investors taking profits. But Yee suggested in a recent video to buy on the dip, as biotechs climb the ""wall of worry.""""Because of Q3 earnings not being hugely great for biotechs, and a combination of uncertainty in the election, I understand we could trade choppy in the (SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI)) until we get some clarity on the election,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were the worst-performing group Wednesday, and IBD tracks 197 groups. But last month, biotechs were on a major roll. Keep tabs on the Industry Theme for which sectors should grab your attention.Like, the 421-company group, shares of the SPDR Biotech ETF have plunged dramatically this month, down 10% over the past three weeks. On Thursday, shares were flat at 61.32, 6% from an entry point at 65.05 out of a flat base.Of the biggest biotech players, Yee is most confident on Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), respectively, Nos. 1 and 4 in market cap. In the stock market today, Amgen and Biogen both rose a fraction, to 164.29 and 294.41, respectively.The consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Amgen to report $5.73 billion in sales and $2.80 earnings per share ex items, flat and up 3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Analysts model Biogen reporting $2.9 billion in sales, up 5%, and $4.97 EPS ex items, up 11%.Biogen is a stock to own over the next three to six months, Yee says. There's a 30% chance Biogen will get taken over, as it still lacks a CEO after the company announced in July, amid M&A rumors, that George Scangos would step down. Yee also sees a 30%-40% chance Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug trial could yield positive results, which could tug rival Biogen up 20%.Other catalysts include Biogen's partnership with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) for drugs to treat type 1 muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Ionis is enrolling infants and children in Phase 3 trials for SMA. Wall Street underappreciates those catalysts, Yee says.Celgene (CELG), too, has a number of trials that could stoke the stock, Yee says. For Q3, analysts model a 22% jump in sales to $2.84 billion and $1.48 EPS ex items, up 20%. Celgene share are down 8.5% since Sept. 23, rising a small fraction Thursday, to 100.63.Yee only expects an in-line quarter. Early next year, Celgene is expected to release the results of trials for drugs to treat muscular dystrophy, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis — which are likely stock catalysts.Gilead (GILD), the No. 2 biotech by market cap, is in for a rough quarter on shadowy visibility for its hepatitis C drug, Yee says. The drug, Epclusa, won FDA approval in June and can be used in pill form to treat six types of hep C. But lacking greater visibility, Gilead stock is range-bound, Yee says.Consensus expectations are too high for hep C sales and EPS in 2016, he wrote in a research report. For 2016, the consensus of 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $11.79 EPS ex items. Yee's estimate is $10.Broadly, analysts are bearish on Gilead's Q3, forecasting a 9% sales dip to $7.53 billion and EPS minus items down 10%, to $2.89. Shares are down 10% over the past three weeks, ending Thursday near flat, at 73.06.Smaller Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) (with a $3.55 billion market cap) will likely print an across-the-board beat for Q3, Yee predicts. But shares have been pressured recently by Gilead, Novartis (NVS) and Allergan (AGN) which are jumping on the NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) train.NASH drugs have made big headlines over the past month with Allergan buying Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) to bulk-up in the NASH battle. But, says Yee, Intercept's drug, which belongs to a class called FXR agonists, is more potent.""Intercept's drug gets into the liver an activates FXR (farnesoid X receptors) in the liver,"" he said. ""The others don't get as much FXR effectivity in the liver; they just do it in the gut. It's not as potent as Intercept.""Yee also calls Prothena (PRTA) one to own on likely positive Parkinson's drug and psoriasis drug data in Q4 and the spring, respectively. Prothena stock was in a sell zone Thursday, 16% below a 65.05 entry point achieved Sept. 19, after rising nearly 1% Thursday to 54.85.RELATED:What Will Gilead Try Buying Next?

Tesla Motors (TSLA) reported a surprise profit, while Qualcomm (QCOM) will buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The Nasdaq fell 1.3% for the week, with Amazon's miss and Apple's modest beat failing to impress. The tech-heavy index dropped below its 50-day line after retaking that level last week. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%, while the Dow rose 0.1%. Bonds continued to fall around the world, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to multimonth highs.In the September quarter, Apple earned $1.67 a share, down 15% year over year, on sales of $46.85 billion, down 9%. Analysts expected Apple to earn $1.66 a share on sales of $46.94 billion. For the holiday quarter, Apple guided Wall Street higher on revenue, but its profit margin outlook came up short. Apple also unveiled new MacBook Pro notebook computers, which feature a touch-screen strip for application commands and shortcuts that replaces the function keys. Apple fell 2.5% for the week, but remains above its 50-day line.Amazon reported Q3 earnings of 52 cents a share, a big gain but well short of estimates for 78 cents. The e-commerce giant plowed money into its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, along with a big expansion of fulfillment centers heading into the holiday season. Revenue rose 29% to $32.7 billion, meeting views. AWS was among the bright spots in the earnings report as revenue rose 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, beating the consensus. Q4 revenue guidance also lagged. Amazon shares fell 5.2% Friday, closing below its 50-day line for the first time in months.Q3 earnings per share minus items rose 23% to $9.06 while total revenue climbed 20% to $22.45 billion vs. consensus estimates of $8.60 and $22.05 billion. Google-parent Alphabet signaled higher investments in its  cloud computing business and higher Q4 marketing costs tied to the September launch of Pixel-branded smartphones and a smart home speaker that competes with Amazon's Echo. Google's Q3 net revenue — despite higher traffic acquisition costs (TAC) costs of $4.18 billion — was $18.27 billion, topping views.Alphabet shares nearly hit a record high Friday morning, but closed the day fractionally higher and the week fractionally lower, but still in buy range.Tesla Motors earned 71 cents a share excluding items, soundly beating the consensus estimate of a 54-cent loss. Revenue climbed 45% to $2.3 billion, up 45% and topping estimates of $1.977 billion. Elon Musk had pushed Tesla to boost deliveries and turn a profit in Q3, but some analysts are skeptical that the effort is sustainable. Tesla maintained its guidance of 50,000 vehicle deliveries for the second half of 2016, with a Q4 plan of just over 25,000.Tesla and SolarCity (SCTY) late Friday were expected to unveil an integrated product offering of solar panels, battery storage and charger. Tesla is in the process of buying SolarCity. Elon Musk is the top shareholder in both companies, as well as SpaceX.Tesla found resistance at the 50-day line and reversed, ending the week down 12 cents at 199.97. SolarCity climbed 2.7%.Gigamon (GIMO) reported third quarter profit and revenue that blew past estimates and raised current quarter guidance. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Gigamon said Q3 EPS minus items rose 64% to 36 cents, while revenue jumped 47% to $83.5 million. Analysts had projected 31 cents and $79.6 million. In the current quarter, Gigamon forecast EPS of 37 cents and revenue of $92 million at its midpoint of guidance vs. consensus estimates of 33 cent profit and 29% revenue growth to $86 million. Analysts say AT&T (T) may be a new customer, joining T-Mobile US (TMUS).Gigamon shot up 16.1% Friday, hitting a record high intraday. Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents. Lumentum fell 3.7% after its late Thursday report, but that followed a 4.3% fall Thursday as Acacia Communications (ACIA) crashed 16% that day and for the week. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE, a key Acacia customer, reported weak revenue.Qualcomm announced a deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for $39 billion, creating the No. 2 chipmaker by revenue after Intel (INTC). Including debt, the deal is worth $47 billion. Mobile-communications chipmaker Qualcomm said the acquisition will expand its footprint into key growth markets, including automotive, Internet of Things, security and networking. The Qualcomm-NXP transaction marks the biggest semiconductor deal ever, surpassing Avago Technologies' $37 billion purchase of Broadcom (AVGO).New Oriental Education and Technology (EDU) met fiscal Q1 EPS views with a 15% gain to 90 cents. Revenue climbed 16.5%, above analysts' expectations, as enrollment boomed. The IBD 50 stock sees Q2 revenue above analyst guidance. Fellow Chinese for-profit school stock TAL Education (XRS) Q2 results topped estimates as total student enrollment jumped 77%. It guided Q3 revenue above Wall Street views. New Oriental stock rose more than 10% for the week, blasting out of a base to a new high. TAL Education climbed 12%, also to a high.RELATED:New Oriental Education Breaks Out On Strong Revenue, GuidanceTAL Education Stock Enters Profit-Taking Sell Territory After Q2 BeatChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) earned 27 cents a share, down 94%, while revenue fell nearly 15% to $1.04 billion, both worse than expected.

473,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) stock lifted Friday after the No. 3 biotech by market cap as investment bank RBC said a trio of drugs in Phase One and Two testing could tack on $3 billion to $4 billion in sales.Those three drugs could help Celgene expand beyond oncology and into treatment of inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in a separate research note.The views of Scotti and RBC analyst Michael Yee followed Celgene's first R&D deep dive into protein homeostasis. Dysfunction of proteins and their pathways has been tied to cancer pathogenesis. Celgene works on treatments for breast, lung and pancreatic cancers.Yee says Celgene has a unique opportunity as a ""discovery engine."" He says Celgene is an expert at inhibiting cereblon, a protein encoded by the CRBN gene. It has parlayed that research into treatments for a slew of diseases including arthritis, cancer, blood diseases and inflammation.""The big picture is Celgene has a unique engine focused on generating new drugs off its expertise in inhibition of cereblon and protein inhibition/degradation that could go beyond oncology and even potential candidates for neurodegeneration,"" Yee wrote in a research report.Yee kept his outperform rating on Celgene stock, which finished trading up 1.7% to 104.53 on the stock market today. Shares are still down 12% for the year, however, Yee noted the ""wealth"" of candidates Celgene has in the works, including a new-generation version of Revlimid, and treatments for lupus and acute myeloid leukemia.Celgene's ""new"" Revlimid replacement is under wraps until the end of 2017, Yee wrote. Revlimid is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.Other catalysts include Phase 3 data on a multiple sclerosis drug, a chemo-combo in partnership with Roche (RHHBY) and readouts on three new irritable bowel disorder drugs.Celgene is also planning additional study of CC-90009, a cereblon modulator, to combat acute myeloid leukemia, Scotti wrote in his report.IBD'S TAKE: Drugmakers, including Celgene, could potentially see a 2%-3% drop in earnings in 2017 and 2018 should California pass a ballot initiative in November requiring the state's Medicaid agency and other state players to buy prescription drugs at similar rates to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.RELATED:Amgen, Biogen, Gilead Could Spike VA Pricing To Skirt California MeasureBiotech ETF At Best Level Since January

475,CELG,"A California ballot initiative requiring the state's Medicaid arm to buy drugs at comparable prices to what the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays could backfire, thus preserving sales for the nation's biggest drugmakers, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Thursday.Proposition 61, the California Drug Price Relief Act (CDPRA), sounds good in theory, Yee wrote in a research report. But that's assuming drugmakers don't simply eliminate the steep discounts already provided the VA.After all, he says, that's what happened in 25 years ago.""Congress passed a 1991 law requiring drugmakers to grant Medicaid similar discounts given to manufacturers' larger customers,"" he wrote. ""But the law ultimately prompted manufacturers to raise prices paid by larger customers, including the VA.""That will likely be the fate for the CDPRA, he wrote.Californians appear to overwhelmingly support the initiative. Early this month, a University of Southern California and Los Angeles Times survey found 66% of 1,900 respondents approve of the CDPRA. A San Francisco firm's poll in July which found 73% in support.For drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex (VRTX), the CDPRA offers merely a headline risk, Yee wrote. Assuming a large 20% price cut to Medicaid, 2017 and 2018 sales and earnings would decrease by 2%, as only 10%-20% of the companies' U.S. products are exposed to Medicaid.If all 50 states enacted such a measure, it could mean a 2%-3% earnings per share risk for large-cap players, Yee wrote. This year, though, California is alone with its initiative. An Ohio proposition didn't make it to the ballot.""However, VA price discounts would then probably become nonexistent since lower VA prices would lead to reduced Medicaid prices,"" he wrote, noting Medicaid already gets a 23% discount.To date, CDPRA opposition has only spent 5% of $87 million in donations. Yee expects that spending to ramp up significantly ahead of the Nov. 8 ballot. RBC research shows 100% of all propositions in 2014 were won by the side that had the most funding. CDPRA supporters have raised only about $9.5 million.Supporters, which include former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, say the CDPRA could save 5 million Californian taxpayers $5.7 billion in 10 years, since the VA pays 20% to 25% less than other government agencies for prescription drugs.Opponents argue the CDPRA could invalidate existing contracts between the state and drugmakers, forcing increased state drug prices and reducing funding for Medi-Cal. The initiative could also increase state expenses as employees spend time and resources matching state prices to what the VA pays.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, having climbed from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago. Stocks have heated on Wall Street expectations of major Big Pharma M&A action. However, on the stock market today, the group closed down 3.6%, hurt by Intra-Cellular Therapies' stock plunge.

476,CELG,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) stock crashed to a two-year low Monday after competitor Merck (MRK) unveiled Phase 3 results showing lung-cancer drug Keytruda is twice as effective as chemotherapy, sparking its stock to a breakout.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol-Myers Squibb stock plunged 10.1% to end trading at 49.81.Merck stock, on the other hand, lifted as much as 3.3% to a 15-year high near 65, and ended Monday trading up 1.8% to 63.90. Shares briefly hit a 64.10 entry point out of a flat base, adding to a 19% gain since January. New buys, though, are risky in the current volatile market environment.IBD'S TAKE: Merck stock is in a buy zone, but it's far from alone. Check out IBD's Stocks Near Buy Zone to find out which players are recommended bets.Shares ramped on Merck's presentation at the 2016 European Society of Medical Oncology conference in Copenhagen. There, Merck unveiled the results of Phase 3 testing for Keytruda, a drug to treat non-small cell lung cancer.Keytruda, alone, extended progression-free survival to 10.3 months vs. six months with chemotherapy for lung cancer patients expressing a specific type of protein, Merck said.Merck also combined Keytruda with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemo drug Alimta. In that study, 55% of patients responded to the combination vs. 29% of patients receiving chemo. Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months longer on the combo.Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab, a rival treatment for lung cancer, showed ""virtually no benefit,"" Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti wrote in a research report. That ""left investors scratching their heads,"" he said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan expects Merck to take a major leadership position in the lung-tumor market vs. Bristol-Myers, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY). Though, he says, Roche might pile on some pressure with its Tecentriq.Tecentriq has shown an overall survival benefit in second-line lung cancer regardless protein expression, he wrote. He estimates $3 billion in peak sales with a 60% probability of success.RBC analyst Michael Yee expects Celgene (CELG) to fly on the potential for chemo-combos like the one Merck tested with Keytruda. He sees Celgene growing its revenue if only 30% of the first-line lung cancer patients are treated with chemo-combos.In other news from the conference, Credit Suisse's Divan expects Novartis (NVS) to face some pressure post-ESMO. Novartis' drug to combat metastatic breast cancer is as effective as Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance, but has some serious safety concerns.""While efficacy appears in line with Ibrance, safety observations of Hy's law (risk of fatal drug-induced liver injury) and QTc prolongation (mild cardiac arrhythmia) may put the drug at a disadvantage to Pfizer's Ibrance or Eli Lilly's Abemaciclib, which may be approved in 2017,"" he wrote.Novartis stock lost 0.7% to end Monday trades at 77.75.Bristol-Myers, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Roche, Pfizer, Novartis and Merck are in IBD's ethical drugs industry group. The group has been slumping, ranked No. 142 out of 197.RELATED:Celgene's Trio Of New Drugs Could Tack On $3 Billion-Plus: RBCAmgen, Biogen, Gilead Could Spike VA Pricing To Skirt California MeasureRoche Drug Scores In Lung Cancer, Challenging Bristol-Myers

477,CELG,"Investors could toast the third quarter, the strongest of the year, but September alone was about as exciting as a bottle of bubbly that gone's flat.In the third quarter, the S&P 500 rose 3.85%, lifting U.S. diversified stock mutual funds by 4.8% on average. The broad market advanced despite barely breaking even in September, nosing upward a modest 0.02%. Stock funds edged ahead a mere 0.22% last month.That raised stock funds to a 6.38% gain year to date.The stock market's start-and-stop motion in the third quarter has prompted many fund managers to plan ahead by sticking with names driven by strong trends, such as the shift to cloud computing, and with companies that seem capable of grinding out growth no matter how blah growth may be in the broader economy.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""The first half of the year saw more of a defensive-led rally,"" said Lew Piantedosi, a manager of seven Eaton Vance funds with $3.8 billion in total assets. ""But in Q3 that reversed. Cyclicals like tech and industrials did better.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWorld equity funds advanced 6.42% in Q3, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds. Last month, world equity funds rose 1.33%. China regional funds, which gained 11.36%, led the world equity market. In September they racked up a 2.39% return.If cyclical sectors stay hot, then stocks tied to transportation of industrial goods and commodities could continue their third-quarter gains. Piantedosi held Norfolk Southern (NSC), which gained 14% in the third quarter, in his Focused Growth Opportunities Class I (EIFGX) as of July 31.His Tax-Managed Growth 1.1 (EITMX) held Union Pacific (UNP), which rolled to a 12% gain.But what if most cyclicals lose their head of steam? Piantedosi prefers the long view.""I focus on big-picture growth trends that are sustainable despite shifting macro noise,"" he said.Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are sustainable growers.""They benefit from great secular tailwinds,"" he said. ""While those names have done well — especially Amazon — there's still a runway for them.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Brian Deagon analyzes the tailwinds driving Amazon. In the ""Buys & Sells"" column, Julie Mak points out that some leading mutual funds have been selling Alphabet and Amazon.Another plus for the tech sector is that acquisitions seem to be picking up, he says.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformancePiantedosi says investors should brace for volatility until the elections. A Democratic White House, with the Senate and House in Republican hands would mean continued gridlock, he says. Still, his impression is that support for tax reform is growing in both parties. ""That would be a huge positive,"" he said.In health care, he's wary of many drugmakers due to political calls for price regulation. Still, he likes Celgene (CELG), Vertex (VRTX) and Biogen (BIIB).""Biotechs feel a little safer (than non-biotech drugmakers),"" he said. ""They are doing wonderful things to cure big diseases. They combine positive reward-to-risk. And they're beaten up and trading at valuations at attractive valuations.""Within retail, he likes a few names.""It's an area to watch as we head into the holidays, especially some more apparel-oriented stocks,"" Piantedosi said. ""This is a short-term theme.""Macy's (M) has gone through markdowns after having to discount last year's overstock, he says. The mild winter dampened consumer demand for warm clothes. And competition is stiff from Amazon.""The company has done a great job managing inventories going into the holidays this year,"" Piantedosi said. ""Expectations are low. And they've been monetizing real estate"" by selling or closing unneeded locations.And he continues to like home-improvement giants Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD).""Housing is still strong,"" he said. ""Interest rates are still low. Consumers are OK. And (stock) prices have come in a little over fears of a housing slowdown.""Jeff Rottinghaus, T. Rowe Price manager of $1.6 billion Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $314.1 million U.S. Large-Cap Core (TRULX), says stock prices in general seem fairly priced. But he likes some names in health care, where prices have been pushed down.He calls Becton Dickinson (BDX), Medtronics (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) ""quiet"" because none is under political pressure over drug pricing. Becton develops medical supplies, Medtronic develops implantable cardiac devices and other products and UnitedHealth is the industry's biggest managed-care provider.Yet Rottinghaus is shopping among biotechs because prices are so beaten down.He is underweight in the tech sector. But he likes companies benefiting from the secular trend of cloud computing's growth. Those include Alphabet and Microsoft (MSFT). He also likes the sustainable secular growth of Visa (V) and Facebook.Rottinghaus also likes NextEra Energy (NEE), which has a 2.9% dividend yield.""It's the largest renewable-energy generator in the U.S.,"" he said. ""Its dividend yield is roughly 3%. But we wouldn't own it without the low-double-digit earnings growth we expect from them.""Growth-oriented sectors led stock funds' third-quarter charge. Science-technology funds zoomed ahead 13.21% for the quarter on top of a 2.89% September gain.Health-biotechnology funds were also strong, manufacturing gains of 6.84% and 5.83% in the quarter.Small-cap growth funds gained 8.19% on average, leading all U.S. diversified stock fund categories.

478,CELG,"Major index ETFs finished flat Tuesday as investors shrugged off weak housing data and awaited the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.Biotechnology exchange traded funds rose, and health care led advancing S&P 500 sectors. Shares of Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) have nearly doubled in price since Monday, to just under 56, after federal regulators approved the company's drug for muscular dystrophy.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) popped 1.4% on the stock market today.SPDR S&P Biotechnology (XBI) added 2.5% for its best level since early January. This ETF is a play on the biotechnology sector that takes on bigger risk for potentially larger rewards.XBI gives each of 87 stocks an equal weight, or importance. So a small-cap company like Sarepta has roughly the same stake in the portfolio as biotech giants Amgen (AMGN) or Celgene (CELG).By contrast, the cap-weighted IBB focuses first and foremost on the biotech majors. More than half of its assets are tied to the top 10 holdings out of 184 stocks, including Amgen, Celgene and Biogen (BIIB).Third quarter to date, XBI is up 21.9% vs. 13.3% for IBB. The former also has a modest edge in terms of annual average gains over the past five and 10 years.As prices for biotech stocks have recovered, so has investor interest in the small-cap biotech ETF, said David Mazza, head of research for SPDR ETFs. Year to date, investors have added $303 million in fresh money to XBI.""Recently, price action has been driven by company-specific news and the influence of the U.S. presidential election,"" Mazza told IBD in an email. Investors should brace for the continued influence of external factors heading into November, he cautioned.Biotech stocks are sensitive to certain remarks of a political nature. Rhetoric about price-gouging in the drug industry tends to intensify ahead of a vote.IBD'S TAKE: Sarepta's muscular dystrophy drug faced a long and controversial march toward FDA approval, but it may mean the company's growth story is just beginning.Energy led declining S&P 500 sectors Thursday.Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) posted a 0.7% loss.United States Oil (USO), a commodity ETF investing in near-month WTI futures, reversed solidly higher.

479,CELG,"Biotech Gilead (GILD) is most likely to scoop up Incyte (INCY) over the next 12 months, according to a survey of 244 industry watchers by Evercore ISI investment bank, ahead of the presidential election pitting Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.Of those surveyed, 16% say they'd most like to see Gilead purchase Incyte, and 14% identified Incyte as the biopharma most likely to be acquired over the next year. Nearly 12% and 10%, respectively, see Biogen (BIIB) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) as targets.Gilead, Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD), Celgene (CELG) and Kite Pharma (KITE) are least likely to be targeted, with only 2% of industry experts identifying each as a likely takeover candidate. That's a departure from Needham's analysis last week identifying 11 potential suitors for Acadia.An Incyte takeover would likely come at a heavy price. As of June 30, Gilead had $24.6 billion in cash, equivalents and market securities on hand. By market cap, Gilead is the No. 2 biotech, trailing only Amgen, but it's widely viewed as among the big biotechs that most needs to be active on the M&A front. Incyte has a $17 billion market capitulation. Smaller coalitions, 10% and 8%, say Gilead could buy Vertex (VRTX) or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Outside M&A, the lion's share of experts (52%) expect biotechs to outperform the broader markets over the next six months, whereas 54% of respondents say biopharmas will merely be in line. Both will trade up after the election, say 65% of experts.But IBD's 241-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 16% this year, but those losses were early in the year, when the overall market tumbled. The group is up more than 25% since late June and now ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago.At the close on the stock market today, the group was up more than 1.4%, bucking a two-day downtrend.IBD'S TAKE: The latest Industry Snapshot explores biotech M&A and promising new drugs, and which stocks are leading the biotech sector.Drug pricing initiatives could rout stocks this year, an RBC analyst said Thursday. Though he acknowledged drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead, Celgene, Biogen, Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex could easily find loopholes to skirt new regulations.Still, fewer than 1% of the people polled by Evercore expect the government to take meaningful action on drug pricing in 2016. Nearly 44% (the largest chunk) say the government won't ever push for a reduction in drug prices.Other predictions stem around specific companies. Only 14% expect Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug, Solanezumab, to hit cognition and function endpoints. More broadly, 42% say it will hit cognition but miss on function.More than half (51%) say Celgene's Phase 3 testing for GED-0301, an oral mongersen treatment for Crohn's, will fail to reach the overwhelming efficacy seen in Phase 2 testing. During Phase 2, 67% of patients taking 160 milligrams were in clinical remission on day 15.A small 7% say Celgene will see better results in Phase 3 testing. Only 3% expect the study to fail entirely. If the results show endoscopic improvement, 64% of respondents say Celgene stock will pop. A third expect shares to remain stagnant.RELATED:Gilead 'Paralyzed' On Likely Hep C Share LossAmgen, Biogen, Gilead Could Spike VA Pricing To Skirt California MeasureRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Falls As Combo Therapy Worse Than Eylea Alone

The S&P 500 fell less than 0.1%, despite another sell-off in oil and gas stocks. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in lower than Tuesday's levels.Solar, oil & gas and airline stocks underperformed.In the stock market today, Dow component Apple surged past a 110.33 buy point in heavy volume, rising nearly 4% and extending gains after Tuesday's move, which was fueled by news of strong preorders for the iPhone 7.Skyworks (SWKS) and Broadcom (AVGO) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, along with several biotech names like Alexion (ALXN), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron (REGN).Several recent IPOs outperformed as names like Impinj (PI), Penumbra (PEN) and Lumentum (LITE) all rose around 3% or more.Inside the IBD 50, 13 names rose 1% or more.

481,CELG,"Biotechs Celgene (CELG) and Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) were trading up Wednesday after the companies said they'll be filing for FDA approval of their blood-cancer drug earlier than expected.Agios said in an SEC filing ahead of its presentation at Citi's (C) annual biotech conference that by year's end Celgene will file an application for enasidinib, or AG-221, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previously the timeline for the filing was unclear. The newest batch of clinical-trial data isn't expected until next year, with the last batch coming out over a year ago.Data on another cancer drug, AG-120, should also be out by year's end, and Agios and Celgene will also file for early approval of that drug in 2017, the filing said.Agios' stock catapulted up nearly 26% to close at 46.98 on the stock market today. The stock has taken an even bigger beating than most biotechs over the last 12 months as analyst commentary has generally been cautious in the face of strong-looking competition in AML from AbbVie (ABBV) and Roche's (RHHBY) Venetoclax, as well as Seattle Genetics' (SGEN) SGN-CD33A.Celgene stock was up 0.2% to 106.96 at the close.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene has been cranking out steady financial growth, but its stock is still looking for a buy point after spending over a year consolidating.

But market leadership rotated back to more defensive sectors, reflecting growing caution among investors.""The more-defensive stocks did well, while cyclical energy and materials did not outperform,"" said Lew Piantedosi, who is lead manager of seven Eaton Vance funds, totaling $3.9 billion in assets. ""It was a complete reversal from the Q4 postelection market rally, which was a cyclicals rally.""Sentiment flipped back in favor of growth-oriented cyclicals after President Trump's address to Congress on the last night of February.But the tilt earlier in February toward cyclicals reflected investors' concern that Trump and the Republican-majority Congress may have a harder time than previously expected in implementing pro-growth policies.Reflecting the optimistic portion of February's market performance, health/biotechnology funds led sectors last month, gaining 6.72%.Among U.S. diversified stock fund categories, S&P 500 index funds led the way with a 3.87% gain.World equity funds lagged U.S. diversifieds, advancing just 1.90%, led by India region funds' 6.08% climb.Taxable bond funds eked out an 0.87% gain on average last month. Emerging markets local currency funds outpaced other taxable categories, rising 1.94%.Piantedosi is guardedly bullish, going forward. ""The bull market is in place until proven otherwise,"" he said. Many investors and market observers have tried to call a market top. But the economy keeps getting better, Piantedosi says. ""Corporate earnings keep getting better, and earnings support the market,"" he added.The wild card that could derail the rally is the political landscape, he warns.As long as the economy stays on track, Piantedosi likes the shift to digital by advertising. ""That benefits Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL),"" he said. ""And Amazon (AMZN) dominates online retail.""Another area he likes is biotech, which is producing a parade of treatments for diseases. ""Celgene (CELG) is a leader within cancer treatments,"" he said. ""It has an unbelievable pipeline. It is growing earnings north of 20% annually and trades at a 17-times forward multiple, just below the market multiple of 18.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. See which biomed/biotech firm is No. 1, and check out its easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.In energy, he likes energy explorer and producer Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and field services provider Halliburton (HAL).He said, ""Anadarko is once again profitably growing production, generating significant cash flow and is attractively valued."" He added, ""Halliburton's exposure is mainly to North American shale, and with oil prices (steady) in the mid-50s, you're starting to see rig counts increase. That increases the need for field services. They put rigs together, service them, replace broken parts and so on.""He added, ""In consumer discretionary, it's hard to find good names. But there's Advance Auto Parts (AAP). They're an auto parts retailer. That sector is less susceptible to be Amazoned. Their business doesn't require a lot of capital expenditure, so it's a good cash flow type of business. And Advance got a new CEO three or four months ago. He's a supply chain expert, which is what Advance needs.""One key reason it is hard for investors to find consumer discretionary that names they like is because so many big-box retailers are getting kicked by online retailers, says James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Asset Management and manager of its $125 million Select Equity (DHAMX). Add to that the risk that many will be forced to cope with higher costs stemming from the border adjustment tax — basically, a value-added tax on imports — proposed by Trump, Abate says.Names in the sector that he does still like include media company CBS (CBS) and specialty food retailer Whole Foods Market (WFM).Sporting an OK 86 Composite Rating from IBD, CBS is trying to clear a consolidation after a run-up that started in the fall.Whole Foods has a very weak Composite Rating of 20 from IBD and is trading at less than half its late 2013 high.The supermarket chain in January reinstalled co-founder John Mackey as sole CEO.Also, the Trump push for infrastructure construction should benefit a number of telecommunications and utility companies, including Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ), Abate says. Comcast has been running up since the election and is near its all-time high. Verizon, range-bound between 57 and 46 since July, is trading near 49, 12% below its 52-week high.Flow-control systems manufacturer Parker-Hannifin (PH) also stands to gain from infrastructure spending. Likewise, Quanta Services (PWR), which provides engineering and construction services. ""They should benefit from increased spending on pipelines and energy transmission projects,"" he said.The market faces risks in the form of geopolitical uncertainty, possible trade wars and rising stock valuations, Abate says. ""There's a lot of downside risk facing this market,"" he said. ""I expect a lot of volatility going forward.""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts released a note Monday saying that Boeing's stock could jump 40% from the border adjustment tax alone.Boeing shares were down 0.2% to 178.73 on the stock market today. GE stock fell 1.1% to 29.54.Not all businesses support the House's blueprint. Wal-Mart (WMT), another Dow stock, strongly opposes a border adjustment tax, along with most retailers whose goods would become more expensive.Wal-Mart shares were up 1.1% to 70.72, retaking their 200-day moving average.While the tax blueprint is supposed to support jobs at home, Boeing will break ground on its finishing plant in Zhoushan by the end of March, according to a report from China's business media outlet Caixin out Tuesday.Boeing announced plans for the facility to finish 737s and started preliminary work in 2015 as it looks to build market share in the rapidly growing aerospace market. The workers at the plant will paint planes and install in-flight entertainment and other systems.While some work is being outsourced to China, Boeing has argued the plant will create more, not less, American jobs.""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in January. ""It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.""RELATED:Why Trump's 10% Tariff Idea Isn't BAT CrazyBusinesses Big And Small 'Enthusiastic' About Trump Economic PoliciesTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform

485,CELG,"Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) was downgraded Monday but analysts are bullish that a proposed border tax could boost shares.Morgan Stanley (MS) downgraded Boeing to equal weight from overweight on ""light"" order flow, but raised its price target to 190 from 185. But the aerospace giant's shares could hit 250 if Congress passes a border adjustment tax. Back in December, Morgan Stanley analysts said Boeing could pay little or no corporate income tax via a BAT, and could even get Treasury to cut checks to the aerospace giant.President Trump has backed the idea of a border adjustment tax, but hasn't endorsed any specific version, including the House GOP plan.Separately, Boeing announced an order from CBD Aviation Lease Finance for 30 737 Max 8 airplanes. The order was previously unidentified on Boeing's website and is listed at $3.3 billion at current prices.Boeing shares reversed higher to close up 0.2% at 179.05 on the stock market today.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called the border tax ""Orwellian"" last month and said it would hit Arkansas-based Wal-Mart (WMT) and raise consumer prices. Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., has also spoken out against the tax.Wal-Mart, another Dow stock, strongly opposes a border adjustment tax, along with most retailers. Wal-Mart shares fell 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's budget plan, which could be released Thursday, will give more details about his $54 million increase in defense spending, putting some defense stocks near buy range. Fellow Dow industrials stock Exxon Mobil (XOM) has pushed back against the tax and said it would ""continue to advocate for free-market principles"" with a ""globally competitive"" and ""stable"" tax framework.Integrated global oil majors like Exxon, Dow industrials peer Chevron (CVX) as well as BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) import oil for their refinery operations.Exxon shares retreated 0.2%.

487,CELG,"General Electric (GE) CFO Jeffrey Bornstein said Wednesday that some industries ""will sit on their hands waiting"" and not invest unless lawmakers deliver promised changes to taxes and regulations and provide more clarity on health care policy.The warning comes as House Republicans' corporate tax revamp is running into opposition in Congress, as more GOP lawmakers balk at a proposed import tax that's seen as a key piece of the overhaul. President Trump has yet to unveil his own tax plan. And while Trump also wants to repeal and replace ObamaCare, some Republicans have turned squeamish about sweeping changes to the health law.At the Barclays Industrial Select conference in Miami, Bornstein said he is ""reasonably confident"" that the changes will get passed in 2017, but said investors could be ""very disappointed"" if they aren't.""If we don't get corporate tax reform across the goal line in 2017,  if we don't provide some visibility to where health care is going in 2017, and if we don't deliver on all the regulatory changes the administration has talked about in 2017, I think we could end up in a very difficult place,"" he said.On Tuesday, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt — along with CEOs from Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX) and other industrial exporters, as well as drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) — wrote a letter urging congressional support for the House's tax reform blueprint, which includes a border adjustment tax.A total of 16 companies signed the letter, but more than 100 companies (including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Nike (NKE)) and dozens of trade groups have signed on to Americans for Affordable Products, a group created to oppose the import tax.GE shares fell 0.6% to 30.33 on the stock market today. Boeing shares were off 0.1%. United Tech rose 0.1%.Last month, as talk of repealing ObamaCare began ramping up, GE's Immelt also indicated that some customers could become more cautious.""If I took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most attention in the media and by our customers,"" he said on a conference call after reporting mixed Q4 results. ""I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven't really seen that much. But that could happen.""Trump said at a rally in Florida over the weekend that a replacement plan for ObamaCare won't be coming for ""a couple of weeks."" He warned earlier that the process could last until next year.Meanwhile, markets are still waiting for the White House to detail its own tax proposals, as those from congressional Republicans take more flak.Last week, Trump told retail CEOs that a ""massive"" tax plan will come ""in the not-too-distant future."" That followed his remarks to airline CEOs in the prior week, when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.RELATED: If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet Order

488,CELG,"No. 2 biotech Celgene (CELG) could bolster sales by $800 million on Receptos' ozanimod in multiple sclerosis, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Friday after Celgene unveiled strong phase three trial results for the drug.Ozanimod was acquired in Celgene's $7 billion purchase of Receptos in 2015. In a late-stage trial, the drug showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefits in reducing annualized relapse rates at 1-milligram and 0.5-mg doses compared with Biogen's (BIIB) rival drug Anovex.The drug also hit on secondary endpoints, including a reduction in gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesions and the number of new or enlarging T2 MRI lesions at month 12, according to Celgene's news release. Indications about its safety were similar to results shown in phase two, Celgene said.Specific data will be released at an ""upcoming international scientific meeting,"" Celgene said — potentially the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in May, RBC analyst Michael Yee said in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene CEO Mark Alles defended pharmaceuticals and biotechs in the drug-pricing debate, saying innovation requires incentive. And be sure to head to IBD's Biotech & Pharma Stock page for the latest headlines from the sector.The safety profile for ozanimod will be particularly important in differentiating it from rivals. Biogen's Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya also hit on T2 legions, but Gilenya's label includes safety information on bradycardia and liver toxicity, Yee said.It's possible Celgene could have similar safety data on its label regarding bradycardia, he said.""How much this impacts the sales of the drug is unclear given Gilenya is going generic (in 2019) and first-dose monitoring is a bit of a hassle,"" he wrote. Ultimately, Celgene's bigger opportunity for ozanimod is in ulcerative colitis where it is slated to be the only pill so far.Credit Suisse's Young says she's most focused on Celgene's MS data in the first half of this year, UC data in 2018 and GED-301 in Crohn's disease in 2019. These readouts will give Wall Street confidence in Celgene's ability to replace Revlimid's patent losses, she said.In the stock market today, Celgene stock rose 2.1% to 121.11. Shares popped above their 50-day moving average on Wednesday after trading at or below that mark for the past month. Shares of Biogen fell 0.41% Friday, to 288.94.RELATED:Roche CEO Shrugs Off Trump's Drug Stance; 2016 Sales Narrowly MissLilly Hijacks J&J Diabetes Share In Q4; Trump-Rattled Sector DipsCelgene, Lilly, Merck Sit With Trump On His Calls To Manufacture In U.S.

489,CELG,"No. 3 biotech Celgene (CELG) set a lofty goal Thursday: Tack on annual EPS growth 2020-3030 even as cancer blockbuster Revlimid loses patent exclusivity in 2027. But investors were seemingly disappointed Celgene didn't update its 2020 guidance.Celgene also announced an agreement to acquire privately held biotech Delinia for an initial $300 million payment and contingent $425 million payments for developments in Delinia's lead program, DEL-106, an IL-2 mutation Fc fusion protein designed to regulate T cells.The acquisition is expected to close next quarter. Celgene expects it to expand the company's pipeline of autoimmune treatment drugs.In the stock market today, Celgene stock fell 2.15% to finish at 111.53. Shares fell as much as 2.6% in earlier trading. Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted Celgene had seen ""upside"" to 2020 views during the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference this month.Though Celgene reiterated that ""upside"" verbiage during the Q4 earnings conference call with analysts Thursday morning, the company didn't boost its 2020 guidance. The company had preannounced most of its Q4 results at the JPMorgan conference earlier this month.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech leaders kicked off Q4 earnings season, with Biogen also reporting this morning. See how analysts expected the group's largest companies to do on IBD's Industry Themes.""Early feedback I've gotten from clients is that some folks thought Celgene might officially raise their 2020 guidance today,"" Schoenebaum said in a note to clients. ""They did not, in fact, raise 2020 targets. Those who believed this apparently (had done so) on bullish comments at JPM about potential 'upside' to the 2020 targets.""For Q4, Celgene reported $2.98 billion in sales and $1.61 earnings per share ex items, up 16% and 36%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Despite the preannouncement, the consensus was still more bullish on sales, modeling $3.02 billion. EPS beat the $1.59 view.For the year, revenue rose 22% to $11.23 billion and EPS ex items rose 26% to $5.94.The company reiterated its 2017 guidance, presented earlier this month, for $13 billion to $13.4 billion in sales, up 18%. Revlimid is expected to come in at $8 billion to $8.3 billion, growing 17%.

490,CELG,"Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) stock dove after the biotech ended a leukemia trial seen as key amid an ongoing rivalry with Kite Pharma (KITE), which had its own problems with investors Thursday.Shares of both fell hard, with Kite sinking on an analyst's downgrade. In early trading, Juno stock toppled as much as 14% before it was halted. The stock later recovered somewhat, falling 11% to 22.62. Kite shares fell 5.7% to 75.10 on the stock market today, a day after touching a 14-month high of 80.82.On Thursday, Juno said a major setback last year forced it to end its Rocket trial in another blood cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The drug was seen as key in its competition with Kite, which is currently testing its KTE-C19 drug in the same disease.Juno is lagging behind its competitors in its efforts to get a cancer treatment known as a chimerical antigen receptor on the market, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt says. The class of drugs helps immune system cells see beyond proteins, which often can camouflage cancer cells.Kite shares, meanwhile, were pummeled Thursday on a downgrade from Citigroup to a neutral rating from buy. That came despite strong results for its drug, known as KTE-C19, for treating the lymphatic system cancer known as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The drug had a 31% complete response rate in 77 B-cell lymphoma patients. Shares hit a 14-month high in response on Wednesday.IBD's TAKE: Juno stock has a low IBD Composite Rating of 25, meaning it underperforms three-quarters of all stocks in terms of growth metrics. A better bet would be Celgene, which has a CR of 97. Head to the Stock Checkup for a rundown of the top biotech leaders.Juno plans to begin a new trial later this year in B-cell lymphoma and a new trial in acute lymphoblastic leukemia next year. The full results of the terminated Rocket trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, though Juno didn't say which.Outside B-cell lymphoma, Juno has a number of chimeric antigen receptor candidates underway in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with AstraZeneca (AZN), and in acute lymphoblastic leukemia with Celgene (CELG), Schmidt wrote in a research report.He kept his 34 price target and outperform rating on Juno stock.RELATED:Kite, Ionis Outplay Med Sector As Perrigo, Tenet, Valeant DiveKite Pharma Cancer Drug Poised For Approval In 2017, Says RBC

493,CELG,"After a typically slow stretch in late August, biotech news is bound to pick up as companies prepare for the fall season of conferences and investor days. Some of the most stock-moving events will likely be updates on key clinical trials, with several expected in September.• Celgene (CELG) is due to release long-awaited midstage trial results on GED-0301, or mongersen, a drug for Crohn's disease that it licensed in 2014 for $700 million. The drug initially sparked some excitement on Wall Street because of its strong two-week remission rate, which beat even the leading injected anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, such as AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade and Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel. But the next data set will cover a full year and evaluate patients by endoscopy rather than just symptoms.Investors' confidence was somewhat shaken when Celgene refused to provide an interim analysis on the trial, which some interpreted as a lack of confidence in the numbers. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that a close inspection of earlier data also raises red flags.""If the trial is consistent with the earlier phase I/II result (on which the original investment was made), the endoscopic remission rate would be in the 60-70% range, which is well above that seen with even the best biologicals or immunomodulators,"" Porges wrote in a July 25 research note. ""In fact, our assessment of the earlier results, and the lack of CRP (C-reactive protein) response, which is a biomarker of Crohn's disease inflammatory activity, suggests to us that the result could be materially lower than the anti-TNFs, with remission rates more likely to be in the 20-30% range.""He noted that since GED-0301 is oral rather than injected, it could still find a market niche, though it would not be the mega-blockbuster initially hoped for.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Biotech group has been on a roll lately, rising from No. 126 to No. 20 in IBD's Industry Group Rankings in the last eight weeks. To see what other industries are hot, follow our Industry Themes column.• Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to release headline data from Zuma-1, a phase-two trial of its CAR-T cell therapy KTE-019 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CAR-T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, are genetically engineered to attack cancerous cells. The trial results are crucial because Kite hopes to use them to file for FDA approval of the treatment, which could make it the first CAR-T therapy to hit the market next year.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimated Friday that the study would yield a 60% to 70% overall response rate (percent of tumors that shrank) and perhaps a 40% complete response rate (tumor disappearance) based on earlier data. But in an initiation report Tuesday, BTIG analyst Dane Leone wrote that much depends on how the data stack up against results from competitors Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Novartis (NVS), which is as yet unknown.""Novartis may present pivotal data sets at ASH 2016 along with the potential for first data from J&J's CD19 bi‐specific antibody,"" wrote Leone, referring to the American Society for Hematology conference in December. ""Juno is also expected to present clinical updates from ongoing CD19 trials.""• Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) should provide a report on its ""triplet"" pills for cystic fibrosis, consisting of its already marketed drug, ivacaftor (Kalydeco), combined with experimental drug VX-661 and one of two additional drugs, VX-152 and VX-440.Another trial of ivacaftor and VX-661 alone recently failed, but it did present a clean safety profile and analysts have been expecting a triplet to be the next-generation treatment in any case.Also this month, the FDA is due to render a verdict on whether to expand the label on Vertex's already marketed CF drug Orkambi to children aged 6 to 11.RELATED:Is EpiPen's Price The FDA's Fault?

The fund has lightened its positions in Boston and Facebook in its latest reporting period, held steady in Time Warner and increased Amazon. General Electric (GE), the top holding at about 5.25% of assets, is about flat for the year and yielding 3%.This hasn't been Janus Forty's best year. The $2.2 billion fund was up 3.02% for the year through Aug. 31 vs. 7.82% for the S&P 500. But it has an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning that its share-price performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Rao, 42, has been on board since 2013. Nick Schommer, 38, became co-manager this year. The helmsmen talked with IBD about their approach and the current investing climate from their offices in Denver.IBD: The fund is concentrated. Why do you focus on just your 40 best ideas?Rao: We don't think there are that many great ideas at any point in time. I take my cue from Warren Buffett, who called diversification ""di-worsification."" He said you should know your ideas one to 10 better than ideas 70 through 80. And ideas one through 10 should have more conviction.For us, 40 is a naturally comfortable level in terms of having the ability to know the companies we invest in.IBD: Does concentration entail a greater risk of volatility?Schommer: I wouldn't say it that strongly. We help to manage volatility by holding different buckets of growth stocks.IBD: How do stocks in each bucket differ?Schommer: Seventy percent to 80% of our portfolio is in compound growth companies. Those are companies with well-defined competitive moats, which have years of growth ahead of them, high earnings visibility and lower risk. They trade at a slight premium to the market but have much better growth.Ten percent to 15% is in blue-sky companies. Those are growth companies that have less well-defined competitive moats than compound-growth stocks. But we expect blue-sky companies to solidify their moats and graduate into compound-growth companies. They have big opportunities. But we make their positions small to manage risk.The third bucket holds special situation stocks. These are future compound growth stocks. Meanwhile, there is a business issue or a financial leverage issue that the company has to execute against. For example, GE over the past year has been divesting its GE Capital business. It hasn't been very attractive, but GE has been reinvesting in its (remaining industrial, nonfinancial) business and returning capital to shareholders. One of the keys to the success of blue-sky and special-situation companies is that they have to graduate into being compound growth companies. That's what we want with GE.IBD: What other key traits do stocks in each bucket share?Rao: We start with the same filter: Does the company have a competitive advantage? Do we believe it is sustainable? Whichever bucket a stock is in, we look at that the same way.IBD: What percent of blue-sky and special-situation companies do graduate?Rao: I'd guess about 65%. Maybe 75%.IBD: The fund was in the top 2% of its Morningstar large-cap growth category in 2015. This year it's more middle of the pack. Why has this year been more challenging?Schommer: In general, the market this year rewarded lower volatility sectors, areas without a lot of growth, sectors where naturally we tend to (take a pass on investing). The sectors that were rewarded this year were consumer staples, utilities and energy. Those tend to be sectors that are not large positions in the portfolio.Those companies may meet our business-model hurdle, but not a lot of them meet our growth hurdle. And now, particularly, they are not attractive from a valuation perspective.The market has treated them as income substitutes and given them premium valuations due to low yields in fixed income. We have instead focused on investments like Zoetis (ZTS), an animal health care company that has characteristics similar to a consumer staples company but with better growth prospects and a more reasonable starting valuation.Energy is another area that has been a good performer this year after a difficult 2015. There are a limited number of energy companies that meet our business model criteria. Most are price-takers tied to the commodity price.IBD: You've slightly trimmed your stake in Facebook. What are your concerns?Rao: It's hard to talk about it without talking about Google (GOOGL) (Alphabet). Both have become dominant platforms for advertising dollars shifting from traditional channels to digital.The reason Facebook has been so effective in monetizing these digital advertising dollars is that they have high consumer usage of their properties. (Chief Operating Officer Sheryl) Sandberg and her team, under the leadership of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have done a good job of pivoting the company away from being desktop-computer-based to being one of the dominant app providers on a global basis outside China.With WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook itself, the consumer is engaged with it to such an extent that advertising dollars move there.IBD: Which bucket is Boston Scientific in?Rao: It's in compound-growth. We bought it maybe two years ago. It started as a special situation. It had a fairly significant legal overhang with Johnson & Johnson suing them for $5 billion or $6 billion.We thought the case was questionable. They brought in a new CEO named Mike Mahoney, who had been at Johnson & Johnson. He came in to reinvigorate their cardiology franchise, which had missed a product cycle. He felt there was a pipeline there that needed to be pushed toward commercialization. The market was concerned with the litigation and factoring little growth for their cardiology products.Soon, they settled the Johnson & Johnson suit for about $1 billion. They've accelerated revenue growth and their margin growth, which had been half their competitors'. They've closed the gap. Execution has been fantastic. We expect more.IBD: Why is Activision Blizzard another position you've increased?Rao: This was another special situation. They bought King Digital, which had the popular Candy Crush game. But the market soured on King after it went public.CEO Bobby Kotick has made a number of strategic pivots. The King acquisition got them into mobile. They've gone from being a company serving 60 million to 70 million consumers through desktops and consoles to serving 500 million consumers... Another 1 billion-plus people watch those games played.Also, they've transitioned more to digital downloads than (dependence on customers) buying a console. That removes the middle man, so Activision's margins become higher.But it's still a special situation because mobile users from the King acquisition have been shrinking. We would like top see them re-engage those consumers.IBD: Amazon (AMZN) has gone up and down in size in the portfolio. Why is that?Rao: We had reduced exposure at the end of last year. They had a disappointing Q4 announcement in January, and the stock got punished. We added back after it sank dramatically.Amazon is the dominant player in e-commerce, and e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales continues to increase. And as Amazon continues to deliver faster fulfillment times, it will gain market share.Another leg of the stool is Amazon Web Services. This gets us to the idea of investing with owner-operators. In 2014, many people saw AWS as a money pit. Fast forward to today, most analysts see its worth as over $100 billion. Microsoft is doing a nice job in web services, but AWS is the dominant provider. Everyone from the CIA to GE is moving more of their business onto AWS. You don't have to have an electricity plant at your house. So why do you need your own data center?IBD: Celgene (CELG) is yet another company in which you've built your stake. What's your thesis?Rao: We reduced our position in the middle of last year. Then this year it went down about 35% from its high in mid-2015. Our analysts felt confident that it was trading at a big discount to our view of its intrinsic value.IBD: Did you trim your Priceline (PCLN) stake because slow global growth means less travel?Rao: This is another business that benefits from network effects. Their core business is Booking.com, which is hotel booking for Europe. They have a similar business in Asia called Agoda. We reduced it given its exposure to Europe and terrorist attacks and higher levels of management turnover than we were comfortable with.IBD: You've also trimmed NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). What are your concerns?Schommer: It's in special situations because it was the merger of two leading semiconductor companies, Freescale and NXP. They are the No. 1 or 2 in their end markets, which gives them a disproportionate share of profits in those lines. And they can invest more in R&D than competitors.But after the merger, the financial leverage of the business increased to a level that was above normalized operating levels. So part of why it is a special situation is that we're watching for reducing the balance sheet to a more comfortable level.IBD: Adobe (ADBE) is another trim. What's your thesis?Rao: They were one of the first to transition from selling software in shrink-wrap to a subscription model. The transition was to a much larger market. But in the transition, revenues and margins declined.We trimmed because the company has largely made the transition to a subscription business and the market is now rewarding them for this higher quality revenue.RELATED:This Top Fund Manager Likes Three Types Of Growth StocksWhat To Do When Your Fund Gets A New ManagerMutual Fund Awards 2016: Top U.S. Equities Funds

495,CELG,"The spectacular rise and even more spectacular collapse of Valeant Pharmaceuticals had multiple causes, but at the heart of the story was how much the biotech company relied on big drug price increases for growth.Not only did those price hikes make Valeant (VRX) politically unpopular, but they also meant the business was ultimately unsustainable. Money managers prefer biotechs and pharmas that produce drugs with growing customer demand, as signaled by growth in sales volume.""As you would think, the preferable avenue for revenue growth is through volume, as significant price increases (like we have seen over the past two years) can only be repeated for a few years,"" Leonard Yaffe, health care portfolio manager at Kessef Capital, told IBD in an email. ""The more the revenue increase is due to volume, the more value is assigned to the drug.""If you're hunting for big growth stocks, and biotechs catch your eye, looking past the headline revenue numbers can help you see which companies might have more sustainable -- and even accelerating -- growth. If volume growth lags sales increases, the company is leaning on price, which might not last.Most price increases are far more moderate than Valeant's 525% and 212% price hikes for heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel, respectively. But many companies regularly lift their prices well past the inflation rate, which can prop up revenue but disguise actual demand.IBD'S TAKE: Big caps can deliver still deliver big gains, often with less volatility than smaller-cap stocks. That's also true in biotech, which has some strong big-cap companies. Amgen and Biogen are among current residents of the IBD Big Cap 20.Comparing volume and revenue is worthwhile for another reason: If volume growth was more than overall revenue growth, this signals that a company is having to rebate more of its list price than it did last year to move product, and/or is rolling out the drug in countries that extracted a lower price (as is often the case in Europe). Investors don't like this either, because it signals that insurers and other payors are putting the thumbscrews on the company.""Payor mix obviously is very critical as well, as large, consolidated payors which cover many many lives have negotiating power and can pick/choose/rationalize products based on price, efficacy, alternatives etc.,"" Thomas Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, told IBD in an email.Second-quarter earnings reports and conference call comments revealed that while some biotech giants and hot stocks relied almost solely on price increases for growth, others expanded mostly on volume increases, and still others credited a mix of both.Amgen (AMGN) was a classic example of leaning on price: Q2 revenue rose 6%, but volume growth was zero.Much of this stems from the age of Amgen's leading drugs. Its top-seller, rheumatoid-arthritis drug Enbrel, is over a decade old, and its volume shrank 2% in the quarter. But it still contributed 10% growth thanks to pricing.Two drugs that are even older, Epogen and Neupogen, shrank in both price and volume because they're facing new biosimilar competition. Newer drugs Prolia and Xgeva made up the difference by growing on both fronts. But this is one reason why, despite the fact that it beat Q2 estimates and raised guidance, Amgen stock initially dropped after the earnings report.In contrast to Amgen, Celgene's (CELG) revenue rose 22% in Q2, and 16 of those percentage points came from volume growth, according to the company. It didn't break the percentages down by individual drug like Amgen did, but the company said demand was good across the board.Celgene also beat forecasts and raised guidance for future sales and profit, and its stock jumped 3% after the report.Medivation (MDVN) demonstrates the sneaky power of rebating. The list price of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi -- for now, Medivation's only marketed drug -- rose 6% during the second quarter. But while revenue overall rose 17% -- a bit less than analysts expected -- volume grew 18%.""The growth in underlying demand for Xtandi was partially offset by a lower net price for Xtandi due to a year-over-year increase in the gross-to-net rate,"" said CFO Jennifer Jarrett on the Q2 earnings conference call, gross-to-net being industry-speak for the rebate level.Xtandi has been in a tight competition with Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga in the prostate-cancer market, and J&J has been undercutting its price. CVS Health's (CVS) recently released 2017 drug formulary passed over Xtandi for Zytiga for this reason.Following their Q2 reports, here's a rundown of how the other big biotechs are faring on the price vs. volume question:""In the United States, the lion's share from a change (on a) year-over-year basis is price, and is pretty stable unit trends on Tecfidera, pretty stable unit trends on Tysabri and modest, gradual decline on the interferon franchise (which includes Avonex and Plegridy),"" Clancy said. ""Ex-United States, we are not seeing any pricing (increases) on a year-over-year basis, and all of the gains are attributable to volume and unit expansion.""Biogen's overall revenue rose 12% in the quarter, beating expectations.Lead drug Soliris provides the vast majority of revenue, and its volume rose 15% on a 10% hike in sales. The rest of the top line came from newly launched drugs that have no year-over-year comparison.Incyte's revenue jumped 51% year over year, beating expectations.RELATED:Are Biotechs Making A Comeback: 5 Stocks To WatchBiotechs Are Making A Case For Leadership, But Is It A Good One?

496,CELG,"Big Pharma Merck (MRK) is now looking at a possible buyout of Medivation (MDVN), according to an anonymously sourced report.Reuters reported Wednesday afternoon that Merck was one of five big pharmas that have submitted indications of interest in buying Medivation, with the others being Sanofi (SNY), Pfizer (PFE), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).Sanofi has been very public about its attempt to acquire Medivation, and last month Medivation said it had entered a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi as well as other unnamed potential buyers. Earlier anonymously sourced reports said that Pfizer, Celgene and Gilead were among the interested buyers.There had been speculation that Merck might be interested: BMO Capital's May 5 research note asserted that Merck was preparing for a medium-size buyout and Medivation could be a target. Merck has been focusing much of its energy on cancer lately, and Medivation has one fast-growing drug on the market to treat prostate cancer and other cancer therapies in development.Medivation's stock had been trading flat on the stock market today, but popped to a 52-week high of 68.37 when the news came out. It closed up 1.9% at 66.48. Merck rose 0.4% to 63.29.IBD'S TAKE: Medivation was an IBD 50 stock up until its last earnings report, when year-over-year profit growth flattened and delivered a big hit to its EPS Rating. Analysts expect growth to pick up again starting in Q4, however. 
"
497,CELG,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) was trading down modestly Tuesday after it abandoned plans to expand the label of its flagship blood-cancer drug to include a form of lymphoma.Late Monday Celgene reported results of its clinical trial Remarc, which tested the drug Revlimid as a maintenance for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). While the study did hit its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival, it didn't improve overall survival, which is generally the most important metric for a cancer drug.As a result, Celgene said it will not seek approval for the indication, though it's continuing to study Revlimid in other lymphomas. Revlimid is currently approved only for a different blood cancer, multiple myeloma.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene's financials have provided a solid growth story for years, but a stock's larger industry group is an important factor in its performance, and so far this year has been a tough one for biotechs. However, in the last couple weeks big money has been flowing back into the group, as IBD's ETFs & Funds section recently explained.Celgene stock fell 1.6% to 106.18 in the stock market today.Expectations for success in the Remarc trial weren't high going in, so most Wall Street analysts shrugged off the news. Nonetheless, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted that it makes Celgene's 2020 guidance -- which it reiterated Monday -- a little harder to reach.""Recall that Celgene included $1 billion to $1.5 billion in revenue from Revlimid expansion indications in their 2020 guidance,"" Schoenebaum wrote. ""Celgene has four other Revlimid lymphoma trials ongoing, but Remarc represented their largest opportunity for continuing growth in their leading product (we estimated $1 billion to $1.2 billion -- potentially enough to meet their 2020 guidance by itself).""Although an indication in DLBCL is not critical to hitting their 2020 target, it puts pressure on the other Revlimid expansion trials to show clear success -- the largest remaining indication under investigation is Follicular Lymphoma (studied in the RELEVANCE trial), which is now likely to be necessary to meet their 2020 guidance.""Results for that trial are expected next year.
"
498,CELG,"Biotech Celgene (CELG) won't seek approval for its expanded use of Revlimid, which is approved in the U.S. in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients.Revlimid achieved the study's primary endpoint of prolonging progression-free survival, but an interim analysis of overall survival showed no benefit as a maintenance treatment for diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.Celgene shares fell 3% in after-hours trading after closing up 0.4% at 107.93 on the stock market today.Celgene reports quarterly earnings on Thursday.
"
499,CELG,"Drug stocks slipped Wednesday after rallying earlier in the day, as the politics of drug pricing resurfaced.The IBD Biotech/Biomedical group hit a seven-month high Wednesday morning, as the group continued the momentum started by Monday announcement of Pfizer's (PFE) deal to buy Medivation (MDVN). This raised hopes for more biotech M&A, which continued -- especially for Incyte (INCY) and BioMarin (BMRN), after Gabelli & Co. argued that they made especially attractive targets.Incyte rose more than 7% in early trading on the stock market today but ended the day up just a fraction, at 82.44. BioMarin initially gained almost 9% but then sharply reversed, ending down 4.3%, at 95.13.The proximate cause for the decline seemed to be presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticizing generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) for its pricing of allergy treatment EpiPen. While Mylan's multiple price hikes on EpiPen had already attracted discussion within the industry, this week the U.S. Senate got in on the act, demanding that Mylan CEO Heather Bresch explain EpiPen's high price. Clinton weighed in around midday Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: When the long-term outlook gets cloudy, look to IBD's Swing Trader for tips on short-term trading.As we noted this month, the biotech stock rally of the last eight weeks might have been driven partly by the fact that drug pricing had faded within the political debate. The group hit a seven-month high on Aug. 4, which it surpassed early Wednesday.RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky wrote in a research note that drug pricing's comeback in politics could be with us for a while.""This is also a stark reminder that political scrutiny on pricing remains high across the sector and unlikely to dissipate anytime soon as we head toward the November election,"" Stanicky wrote.Nonetheless, for those familiar with IBD's chart-reading techniques, there are still leading biotechs that are worth keeping an eye on. Incyte has been bouncing around between the buy and sell zones since it popped out of a cup-with-handle base last month; its financials are also improving, as it's turned more consistently profitable over the last few quarters.Biogen (BIIB) also broke out of a cup-with handle at the start of this month and then blasted right past its buy point the next day on buyout rumors. Since then it's moved sideways, but Wednesday's reversal brought it close to the buy zone again, as it was down more than 3% near 308.Celgene (CELG) has been on the upslope of a consolidation that started in July of last year, and it still hasn't formed a specific buy point. Both Celgene and Biogen are strong stocks overall with Composite Ratings putting them in the top 6% of all stocks.The Generic Drugs group also has been rallying over the last eight weeks, though it's still low-ranked, going from No. 191 to No. 176 on IBD's list on 197 industry groups. The group was up again Wednesday after Lannett (LCI) beat Q4 expectations late Tuesday. Lannett stock jumped 14% Wednesday. Generic drugs, however, are the most direct target of the Senate inquiry. The group fell 2.6% Wednesday after earlier hitting a six-month high. Mylan stock fell 5.5% Wednesday after falling 4.8% Tuesday.RELATED:Hunting For Biotech Stocks?

500,CELG,"Pfizer (PFE) announced a deal Monday morning to buy Medivation (MDVN) for $81.50 a share, or an enterprise value of about $14 billion.The move follows months of takeover speculation for the cancer drugmaker, as well as widespread reports Sunday of an imminent Pfizer-Medivation deal.Medivation rose nearly 20% to 80.43 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today. Pfizer fell 2 cents to 34.96.""The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,"" Pfizer CEO and Chairman Ian Read said in a statement.Pfizer said the deal will boost earnings per share by five cents in the first year after closing, with additional gains after that.Medivation closed Friday at 67.16 with a market valuation of $11.1 billion. That was slightly extended from a 63.04 buy point from a flat base.Medivation traded as low as 26.41 on Feb. 9. But it's been the subject of widespread buzz over possible buyouts. The biotech earlier this year rejected a $58 a share offer from France's Sanofi (SNY).Last week, a report had Pfizer, Merck (MRK), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi as possible Medivation buyers.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs can deliver great growth. But are they generating profit and revenue gains via higher sales volumes or price increases? Here's how to hunt for biotech stocks.Medivation makes Xtandi, a prostate cancer drug with an annual sales rate already above $2 billion. It has other cancer fighters in development.Pfizer's $150 billion attempt to buy Allergan (AGN) fell apart earlier this year after the Obama administration changed rules to make tax inversion merger deals less attractive.RELATED:Medivation Affirms Guidance As Earnings Growth FlattensBiotechs Make Case For Leadership, But Is It A Convincing One?

501,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) was upgraded, Alibaba (BABA) got bullish marks ahead of its earnings, and price targets were raised on Square (SQ), Electronic Arts (EA) and Tableau Software (DATA).Celgene was upgraded to a buy at BTIG Research. Celgene last week narrowly beat analysts' Q2 estimates as the drug company raised its full-year guidance. Celgene raised sales guidance for its lead drug Revlimid, even though the blood-cancer treatment narrowly missed analysts' estimate for the quarter.Shares were up 0.1% at 116.27 at the close on the stock market today.MKM Partners set a price target on Alibaba at 95 with a buy rating. The China e-commerce giant reports quarterly results next Thursday.Alibaba stock rose 1.3% to 84.75.Square had its price target raised to 11 from 10 by Morgan Stanley, with an equal-weight rating. The provider of payment processing services reported Q2 results late Wednesday. Adjusted revenue topped views as Square raised full-year revenue guidance. Square said net revenue rose 41% to $439 million, beating the consensus of $406 million. It expects full-year net revenue of $1.65 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range.Shares jumped 8.4% to 11.32.Electronic Arts had its price target raised to 88 form 87 at MKM Partners, which maintained a buy rating.

503,CELG,"Biotech stocks haven't been for the fainthearted for the last 12 months, but those hoping for a comeback might have noticed they're on the move again.IBD's Biomedical/Biotech Industry group is one of the most improved of the last four weeks, rising from 160th to 36th in IBD's ranking of 197 industry groups. Certainly the fact that the Q2 earnings season has so far been good, especially compared with lowered expectations at the start of the year.Big caps Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Amgen (AMGN) have already beaten expectations and raised guidance, while Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) affirmed its guidance but still rose after a good quarter. This more than made up for Gilead Sciences' (GILD) guidance cut.Biogen was also boosted Monday by unexpected good news on the drug-development front.Biogen stock was up 4.1%, to 301.83 at the close on the stock market today, at a seven-month high. The Biomedical/Biotech group finished the day up 1.2%, at a nearly two-month high.Still, there may be larger factors at work. Over the weekend RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee released a video theorizing that the political fears that led to last year's crash, sparked by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's tweeted threat to do something about high drug prices, have largely been priced into the stocks by now. It helped that both the Republican and Democratic presidential conventions have gone by with barely a word said about drug pricing, so investors might be thinking it won't be such a big deal, Yee added.Yee also noted that medical device stocks have been performing well this year, and it's unusual for a huge gap between device and drug stocks to be sustained. Indeed, the Medical Products group ranks No. 25 and has moved up after a round of good earnings reports last week.IBD's TAKE: Abiomed was among the Medical Products earnings-beaters that week. It's trading near record highs, is in a buy zone and sports a coveted spot on IBD Swing Trader, which identifies stocks with the fundamentals and technicals to product short-term gains.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges also noted the gap between biotech and device valuations in a detailed analysis last week.""Compared to medtech and pharma, biotech is trading at a discount on a growth-adjusted basis; the price of growth in biotech is 20-25% below the price of other medical products sectors,"" Porges wrote in his report. ""The growth outlook for large cap biotech (ex-Gilead), is 40% better than pharma, and 20-25% better than medtech, but biotech stocks trade at only marginally greater multiples than pharma stocks.""Porges says there might be a parallel between the recent panic and December 2012, when biotech stocks declined for a few weeks as investors worried that growth could not be sustained.""By December 2012, growth expectations for 2013 had fallen from +23% to +9%,"" Porges wrote. ""However, in 2013 the sector's aggregate net income grew by +14% year-over-year.... We also note that after the sector grew net income +24% in 2015, future growth expectations have steadily declined since June 2015 down to +17% year-over-year for 2015 and 2016.""We believe these downward estimate revisions are not fully driven by fundamentals, but include political fears and currency effects, and expect growth to recover into the back half of the 2016 as the impact of pricing power and volume demand is realized in profit growth.""Still, it's worth noting that we've been here before. On Monday, the collective value of the biotech group was hovering around 2500, which has been something of a ceiling this year: The group bumped against it twice in April and again in early June before heading south again.

504,CELG,"Biotechs look like they're starting to make a comeback. Just five weeks ago, the Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was ranked No. 175 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks, and it now sits at No. 36.Five noteworthy stocks from the biotech group are Biogen (BIIB), Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN), Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND), Medivation (MDVN) and Anika Therapeutics (ANIK).Biogen and its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) on Monday announced surprise success in a phase-three clinical trial for their spinal disease treatment.Biogen climbed 4% to close at 301.83 in heavy volume in the stock market today, breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 291.02 buy point to hit a 2016 high. The stock was also recently able to retake its downward-sloping 200-day line a few weeks ago after reporting earnings.IBD'S TAKE: For further evidence of the broader biotech sector recovery, the iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF IBB is at its best levels since early January after clearing resistance last week and retaking its 200-day moving average.Supernus Pharmaceuticals reports quarterly results on Tuesday, with earnings expected to jump 333%. That would mark a second straight quarter of faster growth.Shares have been on a big run, gaining more than 130% from their February low. The stock has found support along the 50-day line as it's made its climb, and it's now trading 3% below its all-time high set about a year ago. Supernus closed flat Monday.Ligand Pharmaceuticals is set to issue its quarterly report on Thursday. Analysts expect the bottom line to fall 78%, after an impressive 654% gain in Q2 2015.Shares cleared a 130.06 cup-with-handle buy point in heavy volume several weeks ago and are now extended from the 5% buy zone. The stock hit a new all-time closing high with a 2.7% gain.Medivation is set to report quarterly results on Aug. 9, with the bottom line expected to fall 7%. Medivation has been the subject of buyout interest from several potential buyers, including Sanofi (SNY).Rising 140% from its February low, the stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks. Shares have been hovering just under buy range for nearly a month, but hit a 14-month high in heavy volume on Thursday to firmly re-enter the buy zone.Medivation edged up 0.1% Monday.Anika Therapeutics is trying to rebound off its 50-day line in strong volume after breaching that level on Thursday on its earnings report. Shares jumped as much as 6.6% Monday morning, but have pared their gains and closed up 1.4%.Big-name biotechs Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG) are also on the rise after issuing their quarterly reports last week.Amgen is trading 1% below its 52-week high after breaking out of a cup-with-handle base, while Celgene is hitting a 7-month high in heavy volume. Amgen rose 1.2%, while Celgene climbed 2.2%.

505,CELG,"Stocks crawled higher Thursday amid another deluge of quarterly results. But Celgene raised hopes for biotech investors with a superb gain following a robust report on the top and bottom lines for the second quarter.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%, adding to Tuesday's 0.6% gain for its third straight up session. At 5,154.98, the Nasdaq is now up almost 3% year to date.The S&P 500 edged nearly 0.2% higher, but the Dow Jones industrial average was slightly lower on the back of sharp declines by Boeing (BA) (down 2.2%) and Caterpillar (CAT) (down 1.4%). The former is reversing Wednesday's gains after reporting an adjusted net loss of 44 cents a share in Q2 on a 1% lift in revenue, according to William O'Neil + Co. data.Small caps more or less followed suit; the Russell 2000 eased 0.1%. Crude oil futures, in a slump all week, lopped off another 2% to $41.08 a barrel. Gold and silver moved higher.Volume fell on both the NYSE and Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.Celgene (CELG) gapped up at the open and rose 3% to 111.70, marking its highest close since Jan. 7. Before the open, the biotech reported adjusted earnings of $1.44 a share, up 22% in the second quarter. Net product sales rose 22% to $2.74 billion, while total revenue was $2.75 billion, up 21%.Celgene also gave a bullish outlook for the rest of the year. It sees full-year net product sales of $11 billion, up from a prior target range of $10.75 billion-$11 billion. Its adjusted EPS outlook also increased to a range of $5.70-$5.75 from $5.60-$5.70. Celgene also boosted its adjusted operating margin forecast from 53.5% to 54%.The stock earlier this week took back its 200-day moving average, an important development as the former big winner tries to end its long downtrend and bottom out. Last year in late July, Celgene had broken out of a later-stage base at 129.16 and got to as high as 140.72 before quickly turning tail. At this year's low of 93.05, Celgene fell 34%, just within the maximum range allowed for an ideal cup base.Given how long Celgene has been correcting, one should also keep an eye out for a potential saucer pattern to form. Learn more about this bullish chart pattern by reading this Investor's Corner column.Celgene gets an 80 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. That's good, but not great. However, if the stock continues to climb, an improving Relative Strength Rating and Accumulation/Distribution grade could hoist the Composite score higher.In the financial services industry, MasterCard (MA) sprang to its highest level in more than a month, rising 2% to 95.80 after the credit and debit card processor posted a 13% rise in Q2 profit to 96 cents a share. It was MasterCard's second quarter of double-digit EPS growth in three quarters. Revenue lifted 8% to $2.59 billion.Watch to see if MasterCard can keep rebounding and potentially surpass a 98.09 proper buy point. That buy point comes from adding 10 cents above an interim peak of 97.99 within a somewhat lopsided double-bottom base. In such a base, the stock encounters two distinct sell-offs, and in the second sell-off the stock undercuts the first low. In MasterCard's case, the first low was 94.08 on May 19.This base has formed within a larger consolidation in which MasterCard fell from a high of 101.76 to a low of 78.52. The 23% decline falls within normal range for most key chart patterns monitored by IBD.IBD'S TAKE: In the stock market today, the Finance-Mortgage, Retail-Internet and Medical-Products industry groups helped lead the upside.

506,CELG,"Several big-cap drugmakers reported solid Q2 earnings Thursday morning, continuing what's been a fairly positive earnings season for the medical industry.Celgene (CELG) ended trading up 2.9% to 111.26 on the stock market today after it narrowly beat analysts' Q2 estimates on both the top and bottom lines and raised its full-year guidance.Notably, it raised sales guidance for its lead drug Revlimid even though the blood-cancer treatment narrowly missed analysts' estimate for the quarter. Most of Celgene's other drugs more than made up the difference.Celgene expects roughly 19% sales growth and 21% earnings growth this year, in line with its growth rates the last three years.Celgene stock took a modest hit Tuesday after the company decided not to pursue a label expansion for Revlimid following mixed trial results in lymphoma. It bounced back quickly, though, and was up nearly 2.5% Thursday afternoon, near 111.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) also delivered a modest beat-and-raise, but its stock fell. This might be because much of the quarterly beat came from its hepatitis C drug Daklinza, which is threatened with obsolescence now that Gilead Sciences (GILD) has released its pan-genotypic hep C pill Epclusa. Daklinza is used to treat the minority genotype 3, usually in combination with Gilead's Sovaldi, which also outperformed in Q2.Sales of Bristol-Myers' fast-growing cancer drug Opdivo slightly beat expectations worldwide, rising sevenfold over the year-earlier quarter to $840 million, though it was a bit light in the U.S. Yervoy, which Bristol is hoping to combine with Opdivo to make the standard of care in lung cancer, was also a bit short of expectations.Bristol-Myers stock finished the regular session down 2.4% to 74.66.IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers' 4% earnings growth in Q2 wasn't much, but that's expected to accelerate, and the company is guiding 29% growth for the full year. That's a positive sign, as IBD's CAN SLIM system looks for at least 25% annual earnings growth, preferably accelerating.Rare-disease biotech Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) closed out Thursday trades up fractionally to 130.40, even though its profit technically missed consensus. But that was apparently due to the SEC's recent changes in non-GAAP reporting requirements.""The non-GAAP EPS miss was due to the modification of the definition of non-GAAP income tax ... which resulted in 12-cent-per-share reduction,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis in a research note. ""Importantly, this adjustment has no impact on the amount of income tax the company will pay and on its cash flow.""With the 12 cents added back in, Alexion's Q2 would have beat consensus, although it would still have been a slight year-over-year decline, as the company has invested in new drug launches. However, revenue rose 18%, topping Wall Street's number.Alexion affirmed its previous full-year guidance.

507,CELG,"CEOs of Dow stocks General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and 14 other big U.S. exporters are warning that unless Republicans embrace a controversial tax on imports, a once-in-a-generation chance at tax reform will fail and American workers would be the losers.""Our tax code penalizes American workers who make products or provide services sold abroad, while favoring their international competitors,"" the CEOs wrote in a letter to leaders of both parties in Congress.Among other companies whose CEOs co-signed the letter were Caterpillar (CAT), Dow Chemical (DOW), Raytheon (RTN), United Technologies (UTX), Oracle (ORCL) and some of the biggest drug and biotech companies: Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Caterpillar, Merck, Pfizer and United Technologies also are members of the Dow Jones industrial average, in addition to General Electric and Boeing.The letter puts some of the largest U.S. companies squarely behind House Speaker Paul Ryan and other House GOP leaders, who argue that leveling the international playing field by cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20% (or lower) will be impossible without their plan for a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade.Yet the biggest surprise about the letter may be just how few companies signed it, while more than 100 companies, including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Nike (NKE) and the American subsidiary of Toyota (TM), and dozens of trade groups have signed onto the Americans for Affordable Products, created to oppose the House border tax proposal. (Wal-Mart and Nike are also Dow industrials stocks.)Retail stocks were under pressure from early December, as prospects for a border tax were on the rise, but they've made a modest recovery lately as prospects faded. On Tuesday, perhaps helped more by Wal-Mart's positive earnings report as well-received Macy's (M) earnings than weighed down by a revved-up lobbying campaign for the tax, retail shares were on rise. Wal-Mart rose 3% to close at 71.45 on the stock market today, while Target added 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.Under the House proposal for a border-adjusted tax, U.S. companies would pay a 20% tax rate on the full value of imported goods, while export revenue would be tax-free. The border tax would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to offset the cost of lowering the 35% statutory tax rate to 20%, the conservative Tax Foundation has said.Without the border tax, the ability of Congress to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate will be limited to ""incremental tweaks (that) will not level the playing field for American workers or dramatically reinvigorate economic growth,"" the CEO letter said.It's not clear precisely why so few companies came out in favor of the border tax. Although the proposal seems to be running into a buzz saw among Republicans in the Senate, it's possible that the letter wasn't widely circulated. However, Caroline Freund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has predicted that ""many more big lobbies will be against the BAT (border-adjusted tax) than in favor."" That's because the tax favors labor-intensive industries that export more than they import, with aerospace being a rare example.There's one nagging question about why companies such as GE and Boeing that are so dependent upon exports would back the border tax. Most trade experts who have looked at the tax have big doubts that it would comply with World Trade Organization rules, so it could lead the U.S. into a trade war. Given that uncertainty and the possible consequences, it's hard to understand why companies so dependent upon trade would support the border tax, yet that may partly explain why the list of supporters is so small.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse GOP Border-Tax Plan Would Sock U.S. Tourism — Including Trump Hotels

508,CELG,"Stocks were mixed and mostly unchanged Friday afternoon as major stock indexes continued to trade tightly near highs. The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were poised for their fourth straight weekly price gain.UnitedHealth (UNH) lagged in the Dow Jones industrial average, weighed down by accusations by the Department of Justice that it overcharged for Medicare. Shares gapped below the 50-day moving average, falling 4%. Other insurers fell in sympathy, including Humana (HUM) and WellCare (WCG), down around 4% each.Dow component Apple (AAPL) edged higher after several published reports said the company will start to assemble the iPhone SE in India starting in April.The Dow Jones industrial average gave up 0.3%, the S&P 500 lost 0.2% and the Nasdaq inched up 0.1%. Volume was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq in the stock market today,Shares of Unilever (UL) soared 12% after Kraft Heinz (KHC)offered to buy the company for $143 billion. Shares of Kraft Heinz slumped 4% Thursday on earnings, but the stock broke out Friday, rising 7% to 93.72. Its near the high end of a buy range from a 90 buy point. Inside the IBD 50, manufacturing vision systems provider Cognex (CGNX) gapped up powerfully on earnings, but it was already well-extended in price. Its last breakout from a base was in September.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) was a big gainer in the Nasdaq 100, rising nearly 4% to 95.93. It cleared a three-weeks-tight-pattern with a 94.59 buy point.Also in the Nasdaq 100, biotech Celgene (CELG) added nearly 2%, helped by new its key multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod did well in phase 3 three trial.

"
509,CELG,"Eli Lilly (LLY) heisted some of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Type 2 diabetes share in Q4, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Wednesday, a day after Lilly stock outplayed a mixed quarter on a President Trump-related boost.Lilly stock ramped up 3.1% on Tuesday and continued in the black on Wednesday. At the closing bell on the stock market today, shares ended the regular session up 0.7% to 77.60, earlier touching a nearly three-month high of 78.57. Lilly stock reacted to a softer tone from Trump on Tuesday, who pledged to deregulate the industry and cut taxes.But Trump also called for drugmakers to manufacture in the U.S. in a meeting with executives from Celgene (CELG), Merck (MRK), Lilly, Novartis (NVS) and J&J. There, Trump reportedly backed off calls to revisit allowing the federal government to negotiate on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid.Fernandez, in a research note, said he was ""reluctant to call this first event a victory, but it was not as bad as prior commentary."" He kept his outperform rating and 91 price target on Lilly stock, noting the drugmaker's sales of diabetes drugs improved in Q4.Lilly's Q4 and 2016 sales topped estimates Tuesday, though earnings missed. Fernandez credited growth in diabetes products for sales performance. Sales of diabetes drugs Trulicity and Jardiance grew 200% and 421%, respectively, in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary may have sent drug stocks on a run Tuesday, but his immigration ban on Monday toppled airline stocks. Who's falling and who will survive? Read IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper look.Trulicity belongs to a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor inhibitors where it has 32% of new-to-brand share, with 30% year-over-year growth in the space, Fernandez wrote. Jardiance has 35% new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists, exceeding J&J's Invokana.Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham is less bullish, though he boosted his price target on Lilly stock to 85 from 80 and kept his outperform rating. In the Trump-rattled drug industry, Meacham says investors will prefer product-driven companies like Lilly.""Given the difficulty in triangulating where the drug pricing debate will settle out, we continue to prefer product-driven stories like Lilly with relatively low reliance on price or revenue concentration risk,"" he wrote in a research report.Lilly, though, is likely to struggle in the emerging immuno-oncology market, he wrote. The company is partnering with Merck to combine I-O drug Keytruda and chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. The FDA looks likely to approve the combo, he wrote.""We anticipate that the approval of KN-021G (a Phase 3 study) for Keytruda along with the recent favorable patent ruling could drive a pickup in Alimta growth,"" Meacham said.Outside oncology, Meacham expects Lilly to add two drugs to its pipeline in 2018: baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and galcanezumab in the anti-CGRP migraine market. In the latter arena, Lilly competes with Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Alder Pharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Amgen (AMGN).RELATED:Eli Lilly, Novartis Challenge Pfizer's Potential $8 Billion Breast Cancer DrugPfizer Reports Lagging Q4 EPS; Rebounds On Trump CommentaryBiotechs 'Round-Trip' Trump-Inspired Rally; FDA Appointment Key
"
510,CELG,"Roche (RHHBY) CEO Severin Schwan shrugged off President Trump's crackdown on drug prices Wednesday, saying the Swiss drugmaker expects to reap the benefits of ""literally billions"" invested in the market.""We focus on truly differentiated medicines — medicines which make a real difference for patients,"" he said, according to CNBC. ""I have no doubt whatsoever that there will be continued demand for such solutions, and particularly the U.S., I'm convinced, will reward this kind of innovation.""The U.S. market is important to Roche. In 2016, nearly half of Roche's pharmaceutical sales — 47% — stemmed from the U.S., and 26% of its diagnostics tools were sold in North America. But on Tuesday, Trump reaffirmed his pledge to go after rising drug prices.""We have to get lower prices,"" he told a slew of pharma bigwigs, including the CEOs of Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Novartis (NVS). A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) executive also was reportedly in attendance. There, President Trump promised to deregulate the drug industry and cut taxes.Trump also abandoned his proposal to revisit the idea of allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid, which cover millions of Americans and are among the largest purchasers of drugs and health care services in the world.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary momentarily boosted drug stocks on Tuesday, but a day earlier the president's ban on immigration took a bite out of airline stocks. Read IBD's Industry Themes column for more on a safer entry point in the travel sector.Drug stocks rose 1.5% on Tuesday following reports of Trump's softened stance on Big Pharma. IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group edged up a small fraction on the stock market today. Roche stock rose 0.47% to 30.10, touching a nearly three-month high.Schwan's commentary came as Roche reported 5% growth in 2016 sales to $50.98 billion. The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $51.57 billion. Core earnings per share rose 8%.Revenue from breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis drugs helped outplay a dip in sales of drugs to treat hepatitis B and C, pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer, and wet age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease.The hep C sector has suffered recently, with sales dipping 6%-7% from the third to fourth quarters, according to market researcher IHS. Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD) and J&J have been under pressure recently on their hep C units. J&J's hep C sales dipped to ""virtually nothing"" in the fourth quarter.Swiss Roche saw a similarly painful decline. Sales of hep C drug Lucentis, which is only sold in the U.S., fell 10% in 2016 to $1.42 million. Offsetting that, sales of breast cancer drug Perjeta and rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra rose 26% and 16%, respectively.Roche also listed seven new launches, including oncology drug Tecentriq. Tecentriq is approved for previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer and previously treated advanced cancer of the urinary tract. It competes against Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Merck in the non-small-cell lung cancer sector.RELATED:Gilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV UnitsRoche Gouges Bristol-Myers' Q4 Lung Cancer Share Amid Merck RivalryWill Merck Let Incyte Go After AstraZeneca, Bristol, Roche Team-Ups Too?

511,CELG,"President Trump called for drugmakers to manufacture in the U.S. in an effort to curb rising prices, during a meeting with Big Pharma executives at the White House mere weeks after he accused the industry of ""getting away with murder.""Trump also promised to cut regulations and appoint a ""fantastic person"" to lead the Food and Drug Administration. Tight regulations and a slow FDA often jam the approval process, drugmakers say. Last year, the FDA approved 19 new molecular entities, a nine-year low.His tenor was reportedly different from earlier calls to have the federal government negotiate prices on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid. The agencies cover millions of Americans and are among the biggest purchasers of health care products and services in the world.At the same meeting, Trump pledged to increase international competition, cut taxes on businesses and lure companies back to the U.S. Trump has pledged to put America first. In his inaugural speech, he said ""every decision ... will be made to benefit American workers and American families.""IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Trump has pledged to bring down rising drug prices. But what will that actually mean for biotech and drug stocks. Take a look at IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper dive.Pharma bigwigs including the CEOs of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Celgene (CELG) and Novartis (NVS) reportedly attended the meeting. A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) exec and the CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America also reportedly attended.""The pricing has been astronomical,"" Trump said, according to Bloomberg. ""You folks have done a very great job over the years but we have to get the prices down.""Drug and biotech stocks reversed earlier losses after news of Trump's meeting emerged. IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group jumped more than 3% by the close on the stock market today, and IBD's 43-company Ethical-Drugs industry group gained 1.5%.Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) exchange-traded fund was up more than 4%, near 65 and moving above its 50-day line. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) ETF also was up 3%, near 278, getting above both its 50-day and 200-day lines.RELATED:Biotechs 'Round-Trip' Trump Inspired Rally; FDA Appointment KeyS&P 500 Stocks Set New Highs, But Biotechs Give Back Most Of Trump Rally

514,CELG,"This week will bring a boatload of earnings from large-cap drugmakers. Here are five popular stocks facing turning points in their companies' growth cycle.The key unknown, on the hep C front, is how much the Veterans Administration has been buying, since this isn't available through analysts' usual sources of prescription data.IBD'S TAKE: The N in IBD's CAN SLIM investment system stands for New, as in new management, new conditions and other ""new"" things, such as new products. So it's wise to keep abreast of upcoming drug trial data from biotech companies. Gilead's shares have languished, but the company is expected to release some key data on a possibly big hep B drug later this year, as IBD reported. ""The VA has budgeted $1 billion HCV drug spending for fiscal year 2016,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email Friday, noting that Gilead has historically had a 70% share of VA prescriptions. ""VA revenues this quarter will be important in helping Gilead not miss consensus estimates.""Gilead Sciences shares rose 0.3% in late morning trade on the stock market today.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez lifted his Opdivo sales estimates in a Q2 preview note last week.""Together with Yervoy, Bristol-Myers maintains 85% share of the checkpoint inhibitor market,"" Fernandez wrote, referring to the class of cancer drugs to which Opdivo belongs. ""Based on these trends, we have increased our full-year 2016 Opdivo sales by $450 million (to $3.8 billion) and expect strong uptake in Japan will improve royalty revenue from Ono.""Bristol-Myers Squibb stock fell 0.5% intraday.""We have lowered our near-term estimates for Keytruda and the Januvia franchise based on sales and prescription data, respectively; however we see greater long-term opportunity for each relative to our previous forecasts,"" Fernandez wrote. ""The recent announcement of an overall survival benefit for Keytruda from Keynote-024 trial raises the prospects for the drug in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).""Merck shares fell nearly 1% to 58.26 intraday.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a July 1 note that the trial could bring ""significant revenue upside for Revlimid should it succeed and lead to the addition of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) to the existing product label.""But the study is controversial, he wrote, because it was started before the development of testing for more-responsive and less-responsive patients, and also because the treatment regimen ""may not be the best use of Revlimid in this disease."" Nonetheless, Porges assessed a ""modest positive outcome"" as most likely.Celgene stock fell 0.3% Monday morning. AbbVie rose 0.3%%.
"
515,CELG,"For proof of a more risk-on mood among stock market investors, look no further than the resurgence of growth-oriented funds and biotech ETFs in the past month.As the broad, volatile biotech sector recovers from a drubbing earlier this year, iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) on Monday hit its best levels since early January after clearing resistance last week and regaining its 200-day moving average.This flagship health care exchange traded fund has jumped 11.9% in the month ended Aug. 1 -- a sharp turnaround in performance that has helped it trim year-to-date losses to 13%. Despite wobbling on the stock market today, IBB sits roughly 21% above its late June low of 240.30. That could signal a new bull market for biotechs for some investors and traders. For others, biotechs remain a fool's play with profits still at issue.Investing in exchange traded funds may be a smart way to buy into the volatile, high-risk-high-reward biotech industry. ETFs hold a basket of stocks, helping to mitigate company-specific risk.IBB has nearly a quarter of its assets in biotech heavyweights Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB), which have moved higher after their respective quarterly reports last week. Biogen shares spiked further Monday after the company and its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) surprised investors with success in a phase-three clinical trial for their spinal disease treatment.This iShares biotech fund also has smaller stakes in Medivation (MDVN), Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN). Each of these highly rated IBD stocks is trading near its best level in the past year ahead of earnings.Smaller companies such as these hot biotech names have helped two ETFs outperform their larger sibling IBB in the past month:This relatively new ETF equal-weights its 37 stock holdings, which include Ionis. That gives it a smaller size skew than market-cap-weighted benchmarks, such as the index tracked by IBB.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings have given biotechnology stocks and funds a boost but there are other factors at play too.Bioshares' biotech products ETF has jumped 14.5% in the past month and has inched up 1.8% year to date. That puts it well ahead of IBB over both periods. It also has held up far better than its older peer over the past year, as biotech stocks got battered, but it does not have a two-year history.Additionally, its expense ratio, trading volume and bid-ask spreads may give those hoping to be successful investors pause.""In fact, almost half the names in this ETF are companies with no drug on the market yet,"" writes Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough, who notes that early-stage biotech firms have very uncertain prospects, as well as explosive upside potential.XBI has gained 13.9% in the past month, while giving up 9.3% so far in 2016. While it too is outpacing IBB year to date, the performance of the two ETFs is almost even over longer periods of time.Just four weeks ago, the medical-biomed/biotech group was ranked No. 112 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks, and it now sits at No. 27.

516,CELG,"The major indexes went separate ways Monday, as the energy sector's decline weighed on the S&P and Dow, while the the technology and biotechnology sectors pushed the Nasdaq higher.PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and nicknamed ""Cubes,"" struck a 52-week high on the stock market today.Among its top 25 stock holdings, biotech giants Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG) are on the rise after their recent quarterly reports. PowerShares QQQ also has zero exposure to the energy sector, which has come under selling pressure again.Energy stock ETFs crumbled Monday, the first trading day of August, as an uptick in production and rig counts rattled investors.United States Oil (USO) fell nearly 4% on the stock market today. West Texas intermediate crude settled a hair above $40 per barrel, its lowest level in months, after falling below that level intraday.Increasing OPEC production -- led in part by Nigeria and Iraq -- and yet another increase in the U.S. rig count have renewed worries about a persistent supply glut of crude oil and gasoline, according to news reports.The oil ETF's share price rallied sharply off the February market lows, peaking in early June, before skidding lower again.Energy majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were hard-hit among Dow Jones industrials Monday. ""Exxon Mobil and Chevron remained cautious as the continued downturn in oil prices keeps the pressure on their businesses. The rebound in oil prices from first-quarter lows didn't benefit second-quarter results by much,"" Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote Monday.Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) slipped more than 3% Monday, as the sector contributed most to the decline in the S&P 500. XLE is the largest exchange traded fund holding energy stocks.SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) dumped more than 4%. So did VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH).Both ETFs sit more than 15% off their 52-week high, even as the broad U.S. market trades at its highest level in more than a year.

518,CELG,"It was a huge week for earnings. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) all beat forecasts, while McDonald's (MCD) and Ford Motor (F) indicated some weakness in U.S. demand. Tech M&A stepped up, including a Verizon (VZ) deal to buy Yahoo's (YHOO) core assets. The U.S. economy is growing a lot slower than expected, and oil prices are nearing $40 a barrel.The Nasdaq composite rose 1.2% to its best levels since early December, fueled by strong earnings from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. The S&P 500 hitting a new record high Friday but closed the week down fractionally. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7%, also snapping a four-week uptrend, as weaker oil prices and earnings reports hit the energy sector. The Federal Reserve's statement that the ""near-term economic risks"" have ""diminished"" seemed to have little impact on investors.The iPhone maker earned $1.42 a share, down 23% year over year, on sales of $42.4 billion, down 15%. It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected. Apple's current-quarter revenue target is $46.5 billion at the midpoint, off 10% but above Wall Street consensus of $45.71 billion. The iPhone 7 is expected to be released in mid-September.Apple stock rose 5.6% for the week, just retaking its 200-day line.Amazon Q2 EPS of $1.78 shattered the estimate of $1.11. Revenue rose 30% to 30.4 billion. Amazon Web Services continued to boom. Revenue guidance for Q3 also was strong, though operating income may be light.Amazon stock rose 1.9% to 758.81 for the week, hitting a record 766 intraday Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is a Leaderboard stock, hitting new highs as growth booms. But it's only rated No. 4 in IBD's Retail-Internet group. To see who's No. 1, go to IBD Stock Checkup. Facebook reported Q2 revenue of $6.43 billion, up 59% and maintaining a streak of double-digit growth going back more than four years. EPS jumped 94% to 97 cents, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion. Despite Google's size, it's still delivering growth, says Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital. ""This is now the 18th straight quarter of 20%-ish year-over-year revenue growth, and did we mention acceleration?"" he said in a report.Alphabet stock rose 4.2% to 791.34, closing just above a 791.05 entry point after rising as high as 803.94.Ford Motor sent a signal that the long auto industry bull market is over, as U.S. auto sales stall, and higher incentives hit profit margins. The No. 2 U.S. automaker's Q2 earnings per share and revenue rose, but EPS growth was weakest in five quarters, sales growth was the slimmest in three quarters, and Ford cited ""downside risk to global growth."" Offering further evidence of slowing, auto parts maker Lear (LEA) missed on sales and warned on 2016 revenue, while Gentherm (THRM) earnings missed. Volkswagen (VLKAY) Q2 sales edged up 1.7%, but its net profit plunged 57% vs. a year early as it struggled to recover from an emissions test cheating scandal involving diesel-engine models.Ford stock fell 8.5%.The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged after its two-day policy meeting, as expected. Policymakers said ""near-term economic risks ... have diminished,"" suggesting a baby step to raising rates, and some analysts said it opened the door, slightly, to a September rate increase. But after the Fed meeting and weak GDP data, investors pushed back their expectations for the next hike beyond the next 12 months.The U.S. economy rose at a 1.2% annual rate in Q2, less than half of what Wall Street expected, after Q1's downwardly revised 0.8% pace. Consumer spending was very strong, climbing 4.2%.But residential investment fell, even as separate reports show new- and existing-home sales hitting multiyear highs. Business investment contracted for a third straight quarter. With oil prices falling back toward $40 a barrel, corporate spending may remain weak going forward.U.S. crude oil futures tumbled 5.9% to $41.60 a barrel, hitting three-month lows as the crude tumbled 13.9% for July. U.S. crude and gasoline supplies rose again, according to the Energy Information Administration, which also reported higher U.S. production. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a fifth straight week, suggesting further production gains. But a glut of gasoline and refined products, suggesting less refinery demand for crude ahead. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) reported weaker-than-expected results.Mobileye (MBLY) reported Q2 EPS jumped 70% to 17 cents, while revenue grew 51% to $83.5 million. Both topped views. The maker of driver-assistance systems said that its relationship with Tesla Motors (TSLA) is ending. That news sent Mobileye down 8% on Tuesday, but the stock pared losses for the week to 3.4%. Tesla rose 5.6%.Boeing (BA) reported its first quarterly loss in years due to various charges, but it wasn't as deep as feared. Free cash flow was better than expected on big jet deliveries. Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported modest earnings and sales growth that topped views, but weaker tech services revenue hurt margins. Raytheon (RTN) beat views and raised profit guidance. General Dynamics (GD) topped on earnings and raised EPS guidance, but Q2 revenue missed.McDonald's earned $1.45 a share, beating analysts' expectations for $1.38. Total revenue fell 3.6% vs. a year earlier to $6.265 billion. Analysts had expected $6.27 billion. Global same-store sales, excluding currency effects, rose 3.1% vs. estimates for about 3.6%. U.S. same-store sales rose just 1.8%. Management said they were ""not immune"" to consumer unease -- be it over finances, the election or, in general, ""an unsettled world"" -- that may have hurt other restaurants during the quarter.Shares fell 8.3% to 117.60 for the week, tumbling through their 50-day and 200-day moving averages -- and a 124.18 buy point.Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a large number of restaurant stocks, while Jefferies predicted a U.S. recession would hit the sector. Top-rated Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), which reports earnings in the coming week, fell 6% on Wednesday. But the steakhouse chain found support at its 50-day line and closed the week down 2.3%.United Technologies (UTX), maker of Pratt & Whitney brand aircraft engines, Otis elevators and other products, reported second-quarter earnings per share and revenue that beat estimates and raised its Q3 EPS estimate. Its stock hit a one-year high at 108.49, above a 107.07 buy point. Caterpillar's (CAT) Q2 EPS and revenue both fell as the mining and construction equipment giant deals with an energy and mining downturn. Its stock hit a roughly one-year high at 84.29, rising above an 80.89 entry point. Chemicals giant DuPont (DD), which is merging with Dow Chemical (DOW), crushed earnings estimates but was light on revenue. Shares rose to 69.87, the highest point since mid-December, triggering its 69.50 buy point. Meanwhile 3M (MMM), which makes tapes, adhesives, medical supplies and other products, also reported higher EPS and lower revenue, beating estimates on both. But its shares fell 1.1%.Analog Devices (ADI) agreed to buy Linear Technology (LLTC) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $14.8 billion to create a microchip-industry giant. The deal is expected to close within the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Oracle (ORCL) said it would buy cloud-services provider NetSuite (N) in a $9.3 billion deal. Oracle's Larry Ellison is the leading shareholder of NetSuite. Meanwhile, Citrix Systems (CTXS) will merge its Go To Meeting unit with LogMeIn (LOGM). Citrix was already planning to spin off Go To Meeting.Verizon Communications acquired struggling the core assets of Yahoo for nearly $6 billion, including $1.1 billion in stock compensation costs. ""Despite the massive execution challenges ahead, the Yahoo acquisition demonstrates that Verizon recognizes its own limitations as a consumer brand,"" said research firm The Diffusion Group. Verizon reported Q2 revenue that missed views and in-line EPS, and added fewer wireless postpaid phone subscribers than expected.T-Mobile US (TMUS) in Q2 added 646,000 postpaid phone subscribers, topping Sprint (S) at 173,000 and Verizon's 86,000. AT&T (T) lost 160,000 postpaid phone subscribers. T-Mobile's earnings fell 40% but still beat expectations. Revenue rose nearly 13% to $9.2 billion. ""TMUS revenue growth continues to significantly outpace peers,"" said Matthew Niknam, a Deutsche Bank analyst, in a report.Under Armour (UA) met top-line and bottom-line expectations when it reported per-share earnings of a penny, down 75% from the prior-year Q2, and 28% revenue growth to $1 billion. The Nike (NKE) rival announced several assertive plans, including its takeover of the FAO Schwarz space in Manhattan, as well as a partnership with Kohl's (KSS). But shares tumbled 7.9% for the week.Amgen (AMGN) beat and raised, but its stock slipped as its growth continued to be driven by price increases rather than volume. Celgene (CELG), meanwhile, jumped as only a third of its growth was price-driven, making up for a hit earlier in the week when its drug Revlimid failed a lymphoma trial. AbbVie (ABBV), Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also rose on solid reports. AstraZeneca (AZN) was the biggest winner stock-wise when it jumped 9% Thursday on rumors that Swiss pharma Novartis (NVS) was thinking of acquiring it. The biggest loser was Gilead Sciences (GILD), which trimmed its guidance as its hepatitis C franchise continued to decline.Meanwhile, top-rated medical device companies Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and orthopedics giant Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) each hit new highs after beating estimates and raising guidance. Big Cap 20 stalwart Boston Scientific (BSX) hit a 10-year high after it reported its strongest quarter of sales growth in nearly a decade.

519,CELG,"The two largest biotechnology ETFs are poised at a critical juncture in their troubled growth story. It may be too early to call a reversal in fortune, but they're certainly stock investment ideas once again.SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) on Thursday broke out of a first-stage base, climbing to its highest level since early June as industry giant Biogen (BIIB) trounced analyst estimates for profit and sales growth. The stock jumped 8% in heavy trading volume after reporting global growth from its multiple sclerosis and hemophilia businesses.The largest biotech fund, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), could follow in XBI's footsteps this week by retaking its 200-day moving average. If it does so, and both ETFs manage to hold above that critical line of strength, it could suggest that investors are rekindling their love affair with biotech.Earnings this week will play a part in the success or failure of that attempt. Industry heavyweight Gilead Sciences (GILD) reports Monday, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) on Tuesday and Amgen (AMGN) on Wednesday. Celgene (CELG) steps up Friday.The SPDR biotech exchange traded fund is mired 31% below the price that investors were willing to pay for it a year ago. But it has rebounded 11% in the past month, outpacing virtually all other segments of the U.S. stock market.Jeffrey Loo, an equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, considers the biotechnology subindustry attractively priced after a sharp sell-off. That, coupled with Biogen's solid report, may be behind the recent rally, he suggested.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech exchange traded funds offer diversified exposure to a high-risk, high-reward industry, lowering single-stock risk. But fund investors should get to know the individual companies they own. To learn which stock is top rated in the biotechnology group, check out IBD Leaderboard.In a March report, Loo wrote that the biotech industry would sustain healthy growth over the next several years. Breakthrough drugs like Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni for hepatitis C are helping to drive sales. Loo also has a positive outlook on an issue of key interest to investors:""The industry pipeline is also solid as several drugs have blockbuster sales potential,"" he wrote.One potential headwind in the coming months: the November elections. In an email to IBD, Loo noted that ""the scrutiny over high drug prices"" since the fall of 2015 had weighed heavily on biotechnology companies. Now Hillary Clinton, whose tweet on ""price gouging"" triggered that scrutiny, is poised to become the official Democratic candidate for next president of the United States.IBB has seen assets shrink this year to $7.10 billion despite a net inflow of $357.7 million over the first six months of 2016. The fund holds 187 stocks and skews toward large caps such as Amgen and Celgene, as well as Gilead and Biogen.XBI has also seen assets diminish in 2016, to $2.14 billion. It has taken in $164.6 million in new investor money over the first half of this year. It offers more exposure to smaller-cap names than IBB, as well as a lower expense ratio.Their performance is neck-and-neck over longer periods of time. Both have produced an annual average 15% gain over the past 10 years.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500, a proxy for the broad market, averaged an 8% gain over the same period.

520,CELG,"Biotech Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) said late Thursday that its midstage leukemia trial had been put on clinical hold after two patients died, sending shares of Juno, Kite Pharma (KITE) and other so-called CAR-T stocks sharply lower in after-hours action.Juno said that both deaths occurred last week after the patients, who had relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, took the drug fludarabine before receiving the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that Juno had taken from their bodies and re-engineered to better attack cancer cells. Another patient had died earlier in the trial, but ""confounding factors"" spurred Juno to continue with the study at that time.Fludarabine is common in chemotherapies for blood cancers, and Juno recently decided to add it to the cyclophosphamide regimen it had been using for preconditioning.Juno said that it had proposed to the FDA to drop the fludarabine from the regimen. The FDA asked Juno to ""submit, as a Complete Response to the Clinical Hold: a revised patient informed consent form, a revised investigator brochure, a revised trial protocol, and a copy of the presentation made to the agency yesterday,"" according to Juno's press release. Juno said it will do it before the week is out.Trading on Juno stock was halted after hours but later resumed and was down 27%. The news hit other stocks working in the CAR-T sector: Kite Pharma and Bluebird Bio (BLUE). Kite Pharma tumbled 10% in after-hours trading. Bluebird Bio, whose pipeline is less dependent on CAR-T, was down 5%.Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) last year invested $1 billion in Juno as part of a 10-year CAR-T alliance. Celgene fell more than 1% late Thursday.

522,CELG,"Leerink offered a mostly bullish preview of the coming earnings season for big biotechs Wednesday, offering hope for a lagging sector.Analyst Geoffrey Porges raised his Q2 estimates on Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).He wrote that prescription data from IMS Health (IMS) indicates a ""flat to slightly up"" trend over Q1, with Celgene standing out with 62% year-over-year volume growth driven by its new psoriasis drug Otezla. But on top of that, drugmakers evidently shrugged off recent political criticism and raised prices on a number of products.""The WAC (wholesale acquisition cost) price of Celgene's Otezla increased in April by 7.9%, following an 8% raise in January and, before that, an increase of 9.9% last June -- representing a year-over-year cumulative increase of 28%; Celgene also raised the price of Abraxane in April, a 10% year-over-year cumulative increase,"" Porges wrote. ""Other Q2 price increases included: Amgen's Kyprolis (8% YoY); Biogen's Tecfidera (16%), Avonex (16%), and Plegridy (16%); and Medivation's (MDVN) Xtandi (6%).""Leerink nonetheless lowered its estimates for Medivation, based on lower Xtandi sales, as well as a lower royalty on sales outside the U.S. He also modestly lowered his forecasts for Amgen (AMGN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), though he added that he was still above consensus on both companies.Celgene stock climbed 4.3% to 104.60 on the stock market today. The stock may also have been helped by anonymously sourced reports that it was one of the companies which signed non-disclosure agreements with Medivation ahead of a possible buyout.Regeneron stock climbed 3.3% to 371.57. Alexion advanced 3% to 121.12. Biogen rose 2.3% and Gilead 2.2%.Vertex stock rose 3.6% to 89.66 after it announced a licensing deal with Moderna Therapeutics to develop a cystic-fibrosis treatment using Moderna's messenger RNA technology. Vertex agreed to $20 million in cash and a $20 million investment upfront, with up to $275 million in milestone payments if the drug succeeds.

523,CELG,"Major averages reversed higher after a soft start Wednesday, as the release of the minutes from the mid-June Federal Reserve meeting came and went without much fanfare.Biotechs like Celgene (CELG) and Incyte (INCY) buoyed the Nasdaq 100. Facebook (FB) also outperformed. Facebook rose 2.4% to 116.70, closing above its 50-day line for the first time since June 10.After falling 0.8% early, the Nasdaq ended with a gain of 0.8%. The S&P 500 added 0.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4%. Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume coming in slightly higher than Tuesday's levels. Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners on both exchanges by less than 2-to-1.Dow leaders included Merck (MRK), Home Depot (HD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO). Merck rose 2%, Home Depot 1.7% and Cisco 1.4%.After touching an intraday low of $45.92 a barrel, benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil added nearly 2% to $47.43 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield was mostly unchanged, around 1.37%.The minutes from the June 15 Fed meeting were released at 2 p.m. ET. Before the Brexit vote, the Fed had signaled a couple of rate hikes before the end of the year, but that all changed after the U.K. decided to exit the European Union. Currently, futures traders see little chance of a rate hike this year. The 10-year Treasury yield was recently at 1.39%, up 2 basis points, after hitting an all-time low Tuesday.In the stock market today, Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was a strong performer in the IBD 5o screen of leading growth stocks. Edwards Lifesciences reclaimed its 50-day moving average, rising nearly 4% in above-average volume. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) also did well, rising 3% in strong turnover. It's still in buy range from an early flat-base entry of 32.20.D.R. Horton is among a select group of leaders in IBD's home-building group. See who the others are with IBD Stock Checkup.

Nike also reported strong future orders. Revenue rose 4% but slightly missed views.…

525,CELG,"Big biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) agreed to license an immunology drug from smaller counterpart Galapagos (GLPG) Thursday in a deal that could be worth more than $2 billion.Galapagos' drug is filgotinib, which is due to start phase three trials in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease next year. Gilead agreed to pay a $300 million license fee and buy $425 million in Galapagos stock upfront, and promised up to $1.35 billion in milestone payments should the drug succeed in clearing the regulatory process. If it launches, Gilead will pay a tiered royalty starting at 20% of sales and split the profits.Filgotinib is a JAK1 inhibitor, a class that AbbVie (ABBV) and several other drugmakers are developing. AbbVie once had its own licensing deal with Galapagos but in September opted out of its right to license filgotinib so it could focus on developing its in-house drug.At the time, AbbVie cited a rat study indicating that filgotinib could be toxic to the testicles, leading Galapagos into discussions with the FDA before it could proceed with the new trials. However, the phase two results in humans were positive and competitive with other rheumatoid arthritis drugs in development, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. He added that in Crohn's disease the results seem to lag Celgene's (CELG) GED-0301, ""although (it's) hard to compare cross-trial, different geographies.""Galapagos stock jumped 7% in early trading on the stock market today but by midafternoon was down more than 2%. Gilead stock was flat.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.

529,CELG,"Biotech stock analysts pondered the potential impact of the Brexit Friday morning, finding that most big U.S. biotechs have low exposure in the U.K. but could run into other headaches.Exposure to the European Union in general ranged from 9% for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to 37% for Celgene (CELG), according to Jefferies. Celgene nevertheless told Evercore ISI that less than 1% of its revenue comes from the U.K.Gilead Sciences' (GILD) EU exposure is 19%, while its U.K. exposure is 2.9%, according to Evercore's calculations.Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) EU exposure is 29%, with 2.5% in Britain, but RBC Capital Markets notes that's expected to grow as Vertex's latest cystic-fibrosis drug Orkambi is supposed to get reimbursement in the U.K. next year. RBC analyst Michael Yee said in a research note that it's ""not clear whether these (reimbursement) negotiations will be impacted in any way.""However, Edison Investment analyst Maxim Jacobs opined in a research note that these measurements of exposure were ""looking at the wrong kind of risk. The risk is if a global bear market kills biotech funding.""Needham analyst Alan Carr wrote that Britain's separation from the EU will also bring regulatory complications down the road.""The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which conducts a centralized drug review process for Europe, is based in London,"" Carr wrote in a research note. ""If Article 50 (the withdrawal clause) is invoked, the EMA will need to move, and the U.K. will need to establish a new, separate regulatory organization.""Although we do not expect a meaningful impact on companies with drugs now under review by the EMA, Brexit will lead to a less efficient, more expensive, and potentially lengthier regulatory process for companies seeking approval in the EU and U.K.""Biotechs were hammered along with the rest of the market on the stock market today. Celgene fell 4.3% to 96.29, Regeneron was off 4.9% to 339.48 to its lowest level since October 2014. Gilead faltered 3.5% to 80.47, a 2-year low. Vertex shed 7.1% to 81.90. IBD's biotech industry group plunged 4.5%.

530,CELG,"The Treasury Department's annual financial review of Medicare found that its growth rate won't trigger a cost-cutting panel this week, sending drug stocks higher Wednesday.Ahead of the report on Tuesday, speculation had broken out that growth could be high enough to trigger an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to come up with ways to cut spending. The Brookings Institution had scheduled an event Thursday to discuss the issue.""Last year's report projected that the hospital insurance trust fund would be depleted by 2030 -- just 14 years from now,"" Brookings' website said. ""The report also predicted a more immediate and controversial event: The Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), famously nicknamed 'death panels,' would be required to submit proposals to reduce Medicare spending in 2018, with the reductions taking place in 2019.""The report of the Medicare Board of Trustees actually moved the depletion date two years earlier, but it said that there still wasn't enough growth in costs to trigger an IPAB. That seemed to turn around the major medical groups: biotech stocks had headed south Tuesday afternoon, but after the mid-morning announcement IBD's Medical-Biotech group rose 1.35%. The Ethical Drugs group was up 0.6%.Even if an IPAB had been triggered, analysts doubted the impact would have been that big, given the restrictions on the sort of cuts the panel could make. Late Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets' Michael Yee ran the numbers:""We note 8 million to 10 million 'dual eligibles' added to 50 million 60 million Medicaid patients, thus growing by 20%,"" Yee wrote in his research note. ""Taking Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) Medicaid exposure (10-20%) and growing it by 20% to get the larger Medicaid '23% rebate,' our calculations show that this would change revenues by no more than 1% or so if this happened.""Celgene stock, which fell 2.5% in heavy trading Tuesday, rose more than 3% intraday, closing 2.45% at 99.23 on the stock market today. Regeneron stock climbed 4% intraday, setting for a 2% rise to 351.92 after dropping 2.1% Tuesday. Amgen and Biogen shares rose fractionally after both sank nearly 1% Tuesday.Despite the timing of it all, though, hedge fund manager Leonard Yaffe wasn't convinced that the IPAB business was the actual reason for the stock moves, as biotechs had been trending downward since early June.""The rebound in biopharma stocks today is much more than offsetting the concerns mentioned yesterday, as well as the likelihood of fund redemptions; the stocks had become very attractive, and the prospects for several companies are bright,"" Yaffe wrote in an email.

531,CELG,"Drugmaker Medivation (MDVN) said late Tuesday that it has entered into confidentiality agreements with several potential buyers, including Sanofi (SNY), after the latter raised its bid for the company.Medivation had previously rejected Sanofi's bid of $52.50 a share in cash as inadequate, leading Sanofi in late May to propose eight candidates to take over Medivation's board. On Tuesday, Medivation said that the board had also rejected an offer of $58 a share plus a Contingent Value Right (CVR) on sales of Medivation's drug candidate talazoparib for up to $3 a share.Nonetheless, Medivation went ahead and entered a confidentiality agreement with Sanofi, along with an unspecified number of other unnamed parties.""The confidentiality agreements include customary six-month standstill provisions, subject to limited early termination events, and Medivation expects to provide each party the opportunity in the near term to review non-public information and meet with Medivation's management,"" said Medivation's press release.In early May, anonymously sourced reports said that Medivation had entered into confidentiality agreements with Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN). Celgene (CELG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AstraZeneca (AZN) also have been leaked as prospective buyers.Tuesday's announcement was leaked to Reuters about a half an hour before the market closed, sending Medivation stock up 2.7% to 61.76. Shares were up a fraction after hours. The stock has been forming a flat base since it hit an 11-month high on May 9, the day the Pfizer/Amgen news came out. It holds the No. 50 spot on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks over the past 12 months.On Friday, Medivation scheduled a conference call for Wednesday after the market close, which it said will focus on talazoparib. The drug, in late-stage development for breast cancer, belongs to a class of drugs called Parp inhibitors, which got a boost last week when biotech Tesaro (TSRO) announced a surprise success for its Parp inhibitor for ovarian cancer.

532,CELG,"Drug pricing was on Wall Street's mind again Friday, as Wells Fargo tapped Mylan (MYL) as the next target for activists, while RBC considered the impact of a potential new law limiting prices in California.Wells Fargo analyst David Maris wrote that after Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Turing Pharmaceuticals were hauled in front of Congress and scrutinized by the press for their policies of drastically hiking the prices of recently acquired drugs, he's been keeping an eye out for other companies in his universe that have been doing a lot of price increases.""In the last six months, Mylan has raised prices more than 20% on 24 products, and more than 100% on seven products,"" Maris wrote in his research note late Thursday. ""Mylan has taken some exceptionally large price increases in 2016, including a 542% increase for ursodiol, a generic medication used to treat gallstones; a 444% increase in metoclopramide, a generic medication commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastroparesis; and a 400% increase in dicyclomine, a medication used to treat irritable bowel syndrome.""Maris added that last month Mylan added 15% to the price tag of its biggest product, which contributed 11% of revenue in the most recent quarter. ""We believe that given the regulatory environment, these pricing actions could bring greater regulatory scrutiny and headline risk. Additionally, we wonder if aggressive price increases are being used to make EPS targets or to offset disappointing sales in other areas.""Mylan responded with the following statement:""Mylan has always been known to have one of the industry's broadest and most globally diversified business models and portfolios, which we have successfully managed by balancing numerous variables, including the natural price reductions that have always been inherent to the generics industry. A flawed analysis focusing on a small number of products out of the more than 1,400 products Mylan sells globally and the approx. 600 products we sell in North America is simply self-serving and misleading to investors. This is especially true given that these generic products represent an extremely small percentage of Mylan's approx. $4 billion North American generics business. Mylan's business model is not today, nor has it ever been, premised on price hikes.""Mylan stock fell 2.7% to 44.53 on the stock market today after falling as low as 43. Valeant retreated 5.3% Friday and 16.4% for the week.RBC Capital Markets biotech analyst Michael Yee was also pondering drug pricing Friday as he calculated the potential impact of the California Drug Price Relief Act (CDPRA) on the stocks in his universe, which include Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX).The CDPRA, which goes up for popular vote under California's proposition system this November, would require state health care payers like MediCal to buy drugs at similar prices to the Veterans Administration, which usually obtains large discounts.""We believe CDPRA creates a slippery slope: The measure would encourage other states to follow suit (e.g. Ohio has also proposed it and is getting signatures),"" Yee wrote. ""But we think such attempts to reduce drug costs would merely prompt drug makers to just raise VA drug prices, thus helping less people and not resulting in any real savings benefits.""Nonetheless, Yee estimated that if similar laws passed in all 50 states, it could shave 2% to 3% off the annual EPS of his covered companies. ""Our discussions with large-cap biotech companies suggest firms are aware and wouldn't be surprised if the proposal passed, so we note investors should at the very least be informed of the potential headline and model pricing risks,"" he wrote.Drug stocks were down Friday along with the rest of the market. Amgen fell 1.3%, Gilead 1.5%, Biogen 1.7% and Celgene 3%, and Vertex Pharma dipped 1.1%.
"
533,CELG,"Small drugmaker Medivation (MDVN) continued to battle Sanofi's (SNY) hostile takeover bid Wednesday as the latter tried to replace its board, while big biotechs Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were said to be thinking of joining the fray.Sanofi proposed eight candidates ""who are willing to fully and fairly evaluate all of Medivation’s strategic options,"" which it believes Medivation's current board did not do when it unanimously rejected Sanofi's unsolicited $9.3 billion bid on April 29. Medivation responded with a statement urging shareholders to reject the attempt, which it called ""a tactic for Sanofi to facilitate its substantially inadequate and opportunistically timed proposal to acquire Medivation.""While Sanofi is the only suitor that's gone public, anonymous sources have been telling the media that a variety of other companies are thinking of making a bid. On May 9, Medivation reportedly signed non-disclosures agreements with Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN), implying that it is open to being bought by somebody other than Sanofi. On Wednesday Bloomberg said that Celgene and Gilead were talking to advisors about the idea, though they hadn't actually approached the company.Both Celgene and Gilead have been urged by investors and analysts to make a sizable acquisition -- especially Gilead, as its massive hepatitis C franchise is already eroding in the face of competition. Medivation's current $1 billion in 12-month sales wouldn't make that big of an impact on Gilead's $33 billion top line, but much of the interest comes from Medivation's future prospects: its prostate-cancer drug Xtandi is still ramping while the company studies its use in other diseases, and it also has a few earlier-stage drugs in the pipeline.Medivation stock, which has lately gone tight after a sharp run-up amid the buyout speculation, fell 0.7% to 61.48 on the stock market today. Sanofi climbed 1.8% to 40.94. Gilead edged up 0.8% to 86.51 and Celgene was up 1.4% to 105.11.

534,CELG,"Most stock mutual funds in May extended the rally that began in March. And some strategists are figuring ways to deal with expected stock market headwinds in the summer months.The average diversified U.S. stock fund in May rose 1.55% vs. setbacks in January and February, followed by a 6.50% rally in March and a 0.48% inch-up in April, leaving it 1.92% higher year to date. By comparison, the S&P 500 advanced 1.80% in May.Going forward, most investors who spoke with IBD expect market volatility into the summer. But they're ready.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersLew Piantedosi, manager of four Eaton Vance mutual funds with total assets of $1.2 billion, has a guardedly optimistic, glass-half-full outlook. ""We believe in a core portfolio of secular growers,"" he said. ""Those include names like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL).""Another such name he likes is NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). ""They provide semiconductor content to the automobile and industrial spaces,"" said Piantedosi, who is a manager of Focused Growth (ELCIX), Focused Growth Opportunities (EIFGX), Tax-Managed Growth (EITGX) and Tax-Managed Multi-Cap Growth (EACPX). ""There's a huge secular shift in those areas toward automation and other new technologies that are driving demand for new semiconductor content.""He added, ""In cars, the new features include crash avoidance, music, rear-view cameras, driver-assisted sensors, other safety systems and an overall trend toward electrical vehicles."" In industrial products, there's a comparable shift into robotics and other forms of automation, he said. ""In both areas, NXP is a leading provider,"" he said.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceAmong more cautious investors, with a glass-half-empty view, is James Wong, lead manager of $716 million Payden Equity Income Fund (PYVLX). ""I'm bracing for volatility,"" he said. ""We're entering the summer, when it does not take a lot of bad news to move the market. So, because I'm an equity income investor, I will drink my own Kool-Aid and say investors would be served well by focusing on companies that continue to provide income in a low-volatility manner.""Theme-parks operator Six Flags Entertainment (SIX) is the sort of stock he likes right now. ""They came out of bankruptcy at the start of this decade,"" Wong said. ""They're improving their revenue stream. Management has improved the quality of their parks and introduced new rides. They've increased membership rates, which means people go more often and spend more money. And they've introduced go-to-the-front-of-the-line passes that people gobble up.""The changes have helped. ""They've improved their recurring-revenue model,"" Wong said. ""So they're a steady-cash-generating company, able to maintain and grow their 4% dividend yield.""The market notched a modest gain in May because investors were emboldened by stock market news that turned out to be less scary than they had feared at the month's outset, Wong said.""Earnings season was negative, but not as bad as people had expected,"" Wong said. The prospect of a ""Brexit"" -- a U.K. exit from the European Union -- faded slightly, he added. And the price of oil rose, from just under $46 a barrel on April 29 to just over $49 on May 31.In addition, many investors grew more comfortable with the prospect of an interest-rate hike as soon as June or July.Small-cap growth funds led by tacking on 2.46% in May.Science and technology funds paced sectors by jumping 4.83%. ""When investors are optimistic, they gravitate toward growthier areas of the market,"" Piantedosi said. ""That's tech.""World equity funds fared far worse, losing 0.35%.Japanese funds did best abroad, gaining 2.38%.Taxable bond funds lost 0.14%. U.S. Treasury funds edged up 0.19%. Tax-exempt funds gained 0.55%.May capped a streak of three months in a row of market gains. ""The fear that dominated at the start of the year kept fading in May,"" Piantedosi said.He added, ""U.S. consumers have been strong. Housing was robust. Europe was looking better.""In the near term, investors will focus on day-to-day events such as the Brexit decision, Federal Reserve meetings, November's U.S. elections, monthly jobless reports and the monthly Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), an indicator of the health of the manufacturing sector.Amid all of that noise, remember that the Fed will raise rates because it sees signs of a strengthening U.S. economy. ""And that should help corporate earnings,"" said Karyn Cavanaugh, the senior market strategist for Voya Investment Management and a member of its multiasset strategies and solutions group. ""At the end of the day, stock buying boils down to buying corporate earnings.""Cavanaugh expects an uptick in corporate earnings in Q3 and Q4. Still, if that fails to occur, don't expect U.S. consumer spending to stay strong, warned Cavanaugh, who is also a manager of $39 million Voya Global Perspectives (IWPVX).Wong, for one, says the market's winning streak is likely to end. Valuations are high and earnings growth is weak, he noted.Piantedosi expects disruptive innovators to continue to grab market share. So he likes Amazon instead of brick-and-mortar department stores. Macy's (M), Dillard's (DDS) and Kohl's (KSS) all reported lower quarterly earnings per share in May. All suffered stock-price declines.Amazon reported a 992% EPS gain in April, accelerating from 122% and 118% in the prior two frames. Shares gained 10% in May.He likes Facebook and Google for similar reasons. ""The huge shift continues in advertising (spending) from traditional media to online and social media,"" he said.Ditto for health care. Despite political talk about potential drug-price regulation, he's bullish in the long term on big-cap biotechs like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). ""Who knows how the pricing issue will shake out,"" he said. ""But there's plenty of growth in these companies as they continue to innovate.""Piantedosi is not confining bets to high-flyers. ""In any diversified portfolio, you don't want to be pedal-to-the-metal at all times,"" he said. ""Some names in consumer staples, while not cheap, provide stability and predictability and yield.""Philip Morris International (PM) is a favorite. He said, ""It is 100% focused overseas, where the anti-smoking headwind is less than in the U.S. It has a lot of pricing power. The currency headwind is (diminishing) and likely to turn to a tailwind.""Its dividend yield is 4.1%.Pinnacle Foods (PF) is another he likes. ""It's a nice Steady Eddie food company with decent growth characteristics in a food group that doesn't show great characteristics,"" he said.Pinnacle's dividend yield is 2.4%.

541,CELG,"Midcap drugmakers Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Halozyme Therapeutics and Depomed were moving in the stock market Tuesday after they reported Q3 earnings late Monday, rounding out a mixed earnings season for the beleaguered sector.Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) got a downgrade and several price-target cuts after its lead drug, Xyrem, declined sequentially for the first time ever, leading to a quarterly miss. Sales rose 11% over the year-earlier quarter to $340.9 million, missing analysts' consensus by more than $7 million. Earnings gained 10% to $2.52 a share, 4 cents shy of consensus.Jazz narrowed its full-year guidance in a way that lowered the midpoint on both revenue and EPS. It now expects earnings of $9.45 to $9.60 a share vs. $8.35 last year. Revenue was guided at $1.32 billion to $1.34 billion vs. $1.17 billion in 2014.Jazz also said on its earnings conference call with analysts Monday that there had been disruptions in production of Xyrem, a narcolepsy treatment. Because Xyrem is classified as a potentially addictive substance, it's distributed from one central pharmacy under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). A new REMS went into effect in late August, bringing different forms and procedures that temporarily snarled up the works, Jazz executives said.Executives also said Jazz's drug candidate Leukotac had failed a late-stage trial in graft vs. host disease, and they would halt development of the drug.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler downgraded Jazz to neutral from outperform, partly on revised valuation methodology but also on a soft outlook.""We model below consensus 2016 EPS and can no longer support a buy rating in spite of our cautiously optimistic outlook on a 2016 Xyrem generic settlement,"" Koffler wrote.Canaccord Genuity cut its price target to 170 from 215, Piper Jaffray cut it to 186 from 208 and Leerink cut it to 187 from 220. All three investment banks, though, maintained buy or equivalent ratings on Jazz stock.""Both (the Xyrem miss and the Leukotac failure) are one-time events that shouldn't affect Jazz's ongoing fundamentals,"" wrote Canaccord analyst Corey Davis. ""With respect to valuation, since the specialty pharma sector is in a period of significant volatility, we are increasing the discount rate in our DCF (discount cash flow) analysis from 10% to 12% to account for the risks associated with the market.""Jazz plunged 9% in early trading in the stock market today, but in afternoon trading it was down 4%, near 135.Depomed Hikes OutlookSpecialty drug maker Depomed (DEPO) was heading in the opposite direction after it beat estimates and raised its guidance. Revenue more than doubled to $104.9 million, beating Wall Street's average estimate by $3 million, while earnings jumped all the way from 3 cents to 33 cents a share, excluding one-time items, topping consensus by 14 cents.Depomed added $12 million to its full-year product-sales guidance range, now $336 million to $348 million. It did not guide EPS, but said total earnings should be $58 million to $66 million, up $17 million from its previous range.Depomed CEO James Schoeneck credited the growth to pain medicine Nucynta, which the company relaunched in June after acquiring it from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). Schoeneck reiterated his opposition to Horizon Pharma's (HZNP) unsolicited all-stock bid for Depomed, and noted that Depomed has filed a confidentiality suit against Horizon, which is due for a hearing on Nov. 19.Depomed stock popped almost 9% in early trading Tuesday. It was up 5% in afternoon trading, near 21.Halozyme Falls ShortBiotech Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) was down 11% Tuesday afternoon, near 16, after its Q3 results missed expectations, though it affirmed its guidance. Halozyme's revenue climbed 42% over the year-earlier quarter to $20.8 million, missing consensus by more than $3 million. It lost 19 cents a share, 3 cents more than the Street expected.Halozyme maintained its full-year revenue guidance of $110 million to $115 million, up from $75 million last year. It did not guide EPS, but said operating expenses will be $160 million to $170 million, burning through $20 million to $30 million of cash.JPMorgan analyst Jessica Fye wrote that the more consequential news from the Q3 call was the description of Halozyme's phase three trial of its sole product PEGPH20, which aids in the delivery of injectable drugs, in combination with Celgene's (CELG) cancer drug Abraxane and the generic drug gemcitabine in newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer.""The study has an adaptive design, with both PFS (progression-free survival) and OS (overall survival) as primary endpoints, and includes an interim look once PFS is reached which, depending on the magnitude of benefit, could potentially support registration at that point,"" Fye wrote in her research note. ""Net-net, we remain positive on the opportunity for PEGPH20 in first-line high-hyaluronan pancreatic cancer as well as the potential to broaden into additional tumor types.""Halozyme stock touched an all-time high above 25 in July, but Halozyme and the biomed/biotech group in general were hit hard by the stock market's late summer downturn. IBD's 406-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 20% since touching a record high July 20, and now ranks No. 49 out of 197 groups tracked.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

"
552,CELG,"Celgene beat analysts' Q3 earnings expectations but came up short on sales Thursday, and several stocks in its blood-cancer market moved on new clinical-trial data.
"
553,CELG,"Celgene early Thursday said earnings minus items climbed 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.23 a share, beating analysts' consensus by a penny. Revenue rose 18% to $2.33 billion, about $70 million below consensus as polled by Thomson Reuters.
"
554,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) affirmed its previous full-year guidance for sales of $9 billion to $9.5 billion, up 21% at the midpoint, and EPS of $4.75 to $4.85, up 30% at the midpoint vs. $3.71 in 2014. Expectations for its revenue mix changed slightly, however, as Celgene added up to $200 million to its sales guidance for lead drug Revlimid (now $9.8 billion), and lowered its guidance for Abraxane to $950 million to $1 billion from $1 billion to $1.25 billion.
"
555,CELG,"On the company's earnings conference call, hematology and oncology chief Jacqualyn Fouse admitted that the firm's original guidance hadn't accounted for the impact of the new immuno-oncology drugs treating lung cancer. Those drugs are Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck 's (MRK) Keytruda, which have been taking market share from Abraxane for that indication. Fouse, however, said she sees great potential in the combination trials of Abraxane with these drugs, such as an Opdivo/Abraxane trial in breast cancer launched through a collaboration with Bristol-Myers. She also touted licensing deals developing newer immuno-oncology drugs with AstraZeneca (AZN) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) that were inked this yea r.
"
556,CELG,"Celgene is also seeking to get on the immuno-oncology bandwagon by studying the new drugs in combination with Revlimid and sister drug Pomalyst. Fouse said data from several trials combining Revlimid with Merck's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in multiple myeloma — the blood cancer that Revlimid became a blockbuster in treating — were out Thursday as part of a general release of abstracts ahead of next month's American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting.
"
557,CELG,"""I believe in the abstracts you're going to see overall response rates (tumor shrinkage) in the Revlimid trial of 76% and in the Pomalyst/pembro trial about 50%, with three near-CRs (disappearance of tumors),"" Fouse said.
"
558,CELG,"Otezla, a treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis that Celgene launched last year amid Wall Street skepticism, beat consensus by $24 million with $128 million in sales. On the call, executives said Otezla was taking market share and bringing in significant numbers of new patients.
"
559,CELG,"""If (the) stock trades down on this reaction of just being 'in line' and no change in guidance, this is probably just an over-reaction because of expectations and (because the) stock had run up 10%"" in recent weeks, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. ""The big picture here is ... the growth story is still well intact, EPS guidance was maintained, and it's really longer-term about a possible settlement and 25-plus programs in the pipeline that could give Celgene one of the best growth stories in large-cap biotech over the next two to five years.""
"
560,CELG,"Celgene stock, though, fell 5.3% Thursday.
"
561,CELG,"Abstracts Move Stocks
"
562,CELG,"The release of the ASH abstracts also moved other stocks Thursday, mostly earlier-stage biotechs. Cellectis (CLLS) reported on the first human patient to received its cell therapy, UCAR19, a baby suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The disease was gone 28 days after the patient was infused with the UCART19 cells.
"
563,CELG,"UCAR19 is a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, similar to those being developed by Celgene's partner Juno as well as Kite Pharma (KITE), Novartis (NVS) and others. However, the other players have to develop an individual treatment for every patient by extracting the patient's cells, altering them and re-injecting them. Cellectis' CAR-T therapy is allogeneic — developed from other cells ""off the shelf"" — potentially bringing economic advantages.
"
564,CELG,"""Since the abstract was submitted in July, the patient continues to remain disease-free and was eligible to receiving a stem cell transplant approximately three months after receiving UCART19,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Biren Amin in a research note. ""In our view, this provides the first clinical evidence of clinical activity of UCART19 and provides confidence in the allogeneic gene editing approach developed by Cellectis.""
"
565,CELG,"Cellectis stock already had been rising steeply ahead of the abstract release and rose as much as 21% Thursday to a five-month high, but ""sell on the news"" seemed to take over in the afternoon and it closed up 18%. Juno stock fell 7% Thursday, while Kite fell 2%.
"
566,CELG,"Also on the downside, Bluebird Bio (BLUE) tumbled 22% to a 10-month low on several studies of its early-stage gene therapy, LentiGlobin, for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, two inherited conditions that can cause severe anemia.
"
567,CELG,"Previous data had gotten investors' hopes up about LentiGlobin being a possible cure for sickle cell disease in particular. The most recent studies, however, suggest that patients with the beta-zero subtype of beta-thalassemia did not respond as well as other types, with some patients remaining dependent on blood transfusions.Celgene beat analysts' Q3 earnings expectations but came up short on sales Thursday, and several stocks in its blood-cancer market moved on new clinical-trial data.Celgene early Thursday said earnings minus items climbed 27% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.23 a share, beating analysts' consensus by a penny.

606,CELG,"No. 2 biotech Gilead Sciences (GILD) will likely guide to declining 2017 sales, hamstrung on limited Hepatitis C visibility, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Wednesday, noting expectations are better for Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), as the Q4 earnings season gets underway.For 2017, Yee expects Gilead to guide to $27 billion to $29 billion in product sales, bracketing consensus views for $28 billion. That would be down 8% at the midpoint of guidance vs. early 2016 guidance for $30 billion to $31 billion.""We appreciate that visibility is tough on Hep C right now, but buy-side consensus is also fairly low on Gilead given known uncertainties,"" Yee wrote in a research report. He predicts a decline of more than $1 billion in 2017 Hep C sales.Gilead makes Sovaldi and Harvoni to combat Hep C. In the U.S., though, prescriptions of Hep C drugs fell 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4, according to market tracker IMS. Europe remains a ""wild card,"" but the Q3 volume of patients fell markedly from Q2, Yee wrote.""This is an ongoing concern given the bolus continues to wear down in EU as the launches have occurred in major regions over the past year or so,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""Merck is now launching in a number of regions with possible lower pricing.""IBD'S TAKE: A small biotech and four IPOs outlasted giants like Amgen and Biogen to top 2016 stock gains among companies that started the year above 10 and traded an average daily volume of 10,000 shares. Was your pick among them? Check out IBD's Industry Themes.For Q4, Yee expects Gilead to report $7.2 billion in sales, a tick above broader consensus views for $7.1 billion. The consensus of 28 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Gilead to report $2.62 earnings per share ex items. Yee sees $2.59.Gilead is set to report its Q4 earnings and issue 2017 guidance after hours Feb. 7. Among big biotechs, Amgen and Biogen are ""set up well into (earnings per share) and guidance where there is current investor uncertainty and nervousness,"" Yee says.Amgen, which is scheduled to report late Feb. 2, is widely modeled at $5.8 billion in sales and $2.79 EPS minus items. Then, Amgen could report data from its (cardiovascular outcomes trial) CVOT in PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha, Yee wrote.""Whenever the CVOT data is out we see a 20%-25% CVOT benefit with higher-end stock trading up 3-5%,"" he wrote. The ""Street will want to own names that can hit earnings and give good guidance, and CVOT data is 'de-risking.'""For Biogen, 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters view $2.94 billion in sales and $4.98 EPS minus items. Yee sees $2.9 billion and $4.68. Biogen is set to report early Jan. 26.Biogen's story is clearer after it settled a patent dispute over Tecfidera with Forward Pharma (FWP). The company will also likely discuss its spinoff of its hemophilia unit into Bioverativ.

607,CELG,"SAN FRANCISCO — Celgene (CELG) CEO Mark Alles parried back Tuesday against so-called social contracts with patients, like that of Allergan (AGN), in the face of the drug-pricing debate that spiked last year on Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen and Turing Pharmaceuticals' HIV medication.""The debate is not new, it's just new because of social media,"" he said. ""Many pharma companies have become public in proclaiming free access programs. ... It's interesting because those principles have been at play at Celgene for years.""Speaking at a media panel Tuesday at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Alles outlined a series of programs at Celgene to offer less expensive or free access to Revlimid, a key chemotherapy to treat multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome and mantle cell lymphoma.Alles estimated that 6% of Celgene's medicine goes to patients for free each year. To subsidize that, as well as reinvest in R&D — CFO Peter Kellogg says Celgene reinvests north of 35% into R&D when accounting for partnerships — the company must hike prices each year.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, meaning it has outperformed 93% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 5 out of 420 companies in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. To see which companies lead the sector, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""People think lowering prices is the answer (to the drug-pricing debate),"" he said. ""What if that meant we no longer had the threshold to provide access to patients who don't have a safety net?""The trouble is, Celgene isn't alone in annual price hikes. Last July, the Wall Street Journal found that drug prices had jumped about 10% vs. year-earlier figures. Alles says a number of factors are at play. Complicating matters, consumers generally don't understand the costly drug-development process.For instance, to run a ""pivotal,"" late-stage trial costs $100 million, on average. If the drug fails, the firm could be out millions, Alles said.""We welcome comprehensive transparency and look forward to how that evolves,"" he said. ""Incentives have to exist for companies to take risk to create returns.""Biopharmas and generics alike can't simply agree to prices — that's illegal, Alles noted. Late Monday, a pair of former Heritage Pharmaceuticals executives admitted to a price-fixing scheme between April 2013 and December 2015 involving a generic antibiotic and a diabetes drug, according to Philly.com.Ex-CEO Jeffrey Glazer and Jason Malek, former senior vice president of commercial operations, pleaded guilty in a federal court in Philadelphia to conspiring to manipulate drug prices. Federal investigators are also looking at Mylan, Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and four other drugmakers under suspicion of price-fixing.""We can't do as an industry what people want us to do,"" Alles said. But, he assured, ""no one in the U.S. is paying list price for drugs.""Celgene shares fell 0.2% to 119.98 on the stock market today. Celgene, working on a consolidation with a 127.10 buy point, rose 0.5% on Monday as it raised its 2017 profit forecast.

638,CELG,"News from the Medicines Company (MDCO) Monday was a reminder that innovation is alive and well in the biotech space. Shares surged after the company announced positive phase-one trial data for an experimental cholesterol drug it's developing with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).

639,CELG,"The major index ETFs downshifted further Monday, as China and the Federal Reserve have continued to weigh on the stock market. On the last trading day of August, exchange traded funds tracking the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 posted their largest monthly losses since 2012. Last week, turbulence in the stock market whipsawed investors even as it intensified worries about a global slowdown and raised doubts about the wisdom of a Fed rate hike next month.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) slipped 0.7% on the stock market today.The ETF holds 30 blue-chip industrial leaders.Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE) and IBD Leaderboard stock Visa (V) were among DIA's lead decliners.No. 1 holding Goldman Sachs (GS) and Intel (INTC) were among only six stocks in DIA that advanced.DIA pegged a 6% decline for August, its worst monthly loss in 3 years.So did SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, and PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks in the Nasdaq Composite Index.SPY fell 0.9% Monday, with every sector besides energy in the red. QQQ gave up 1.2%.Among QQQ's top 25 holdings, biotech stocks Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) were among the hardest hit at Monday's close. They lost 2% to 4% each.IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) took a 3.2% hit and Market Vectors Biotechnology (BBH) 3.3%, the worst among sector- and industry-focused ETFs.The so-called ""death cross"" on SPY's daily chart is its first appearance in four years. The pattern occurs when a short-term moving average, like the 10-week moving average, slips below a long-term line like the 40-week moving average. It's seen as a bearish signal, warning of loss of momentum and more losses ahead.According to market watchers interviewed by CNBC, crosses on the daily chart may be less relevant than longer-term crosses.It may be more worrisome, therefore, that the weekly charts for SPY and DIA also show this pattern.Here's a look at how benchmark exchange traded funds tracking various asset classes are performing today.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:10 Bellwether ETFs: SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), +0.1%, RS 54 IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.1%, RS 70 PowerShares DB US$ Bullish (UUP), -0.2%, RS 80 Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), -0.2%, RS 25 IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), -0.4%, RS 61 SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.7%, RS 51 IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), -0.7%, RS 61 IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.8%, RS 47 SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -0.9%, RS 61 PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), -1.2%, RS 70Follow Aparna Narayanan on Twitter: @IBD_ANarayanan.

"
662,CELG,"While drugs for treating and curing hepatitis C have made one biotech company the envy of the industry, another biotech — Celgene — is poised to break ahead of its peer pack over the next few years.
"
663,CELG,"Celgene's (CELG) sales and profit growth is seen rising in double digits through at least 2019 from multiple drugs for multiple disorders.
"
664,CELG,"Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the biotech firm behind hepatitis C drug Harvoni and its predecessor Sovaldi — is expected to see earnings slow to low single digits over that time starting in 2016 as patients cure out of the liver virus.
"
665,CELG,"Other big-cap biotechs, such as Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), will also fall far short of Celgene's expected growth rate, analysts say.
"
666,CELG,"""Celgene has the best top-line growth in all of large biotech right now and will have the fastest revenue and earnings growth over the next five years,"" said Michael Yee, managing director and analyst with RBC Capital Markets.
"
667,CELG,"'Next Major Mover'?
"
668,CELG,"Piper Jaffray analysts told clients in a recent research report that Celgene is ""positioned to be a next major mover among large-cap biotech stocks.""
"
669,CELG,"They noted that Celgene is a returning name ""as a top large-cap pick for us."" Its shares have climbed 19% this year.
"
670,CELG,"Celgene has been especially active in developing drugs for various cancers and immune-inflammatory diseases.
"
671,CELG,"Two drugs that fight at least one common disease, multiple myeloma, are among its fastest growing.
"
672,CELG,"The first, Revlimid, is Celgene's top-selling drug, with $1.44 billion in sales in the second quarter, 19% higher than a year earlier. The oral drug is used to treat anemia and multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood that affects plasma cells.
"
673,CELG,"Sales of Pomalyst, similar to Revlimid but more potent, increased 46% over last year to $235 million, making it the fastest growing of the company's current lineup. The drug launched in Japan in June.
"
674,CELG,"Other drugs currently generating revenue for Celgene include Abraxane, which treats advanced cancers in the breast, lungs and pancreas; Vidaza, which helps bone marrow produce healthier blood cells; and Otezla, a pill for treating psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis.
"
675,CELG,"With sales in the second quarter up 13% from the prior year, to $244 million, Abraxane is one of Celgene's slower-growing drugs.
"
676,CELG,"Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn noted that it ""continues to face competition in breast and lung cancer,"" though its share in treating pancreatic cancer in the U.S., now at 50%, has been growing.
"
677,CELG,"Analysts expect new indications and geographic expansion to keep Abraxane from petering out.
"
678,CELG,"Sales of Otezla, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in March 2014, totaled $90 million in Q2, up 49% from Q1.
"
679,CELG,"Total revenue in the quarter rose 22% to $2.28 billion. Analysts expect full-year revenue to rise 21% to $9.3 billion. Earnings are seen growing 29% to $4.78 per share and rising another 24% in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters.
"
680,CELG,"But there's a lot more to come from other drugs percolating in the wings. In Celgene's Q2 report in late July, CEO Bob Hugin said that new transactions with AstraZeneca (AZN), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Receptos (RCPT) would likely speed up earnings growth, starting in 2019.
"
681,CELG,"The biggest deal, announced mid-July and valued at $7.2 billion, is Celgene's pending acquisition of Receptos, a biotech firm whose lead drug, Ozanimod, has shown good results in treating ulcerative colitis and relapsing multiple sclerosis.
"
682,CELG,"Biggest Biotech Mergers
"
683,CELG,"If a higher bid doesn't thwart the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter, it would be one of the largest mergers and acquisitions in the biotech/drug industry this year, after AbbVie's (ABBV) $21 billion bid for Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Alexion 's (ALXN) $8.4 billion agreement to merge with Synageva BioPharma (GEVA).
"
684,CELG,"Celgene's offer for Receptos, amounting to $232 per share, expires August 24.
"
685,CELG,"Receptos' oral pill Ozanimod could generate around $2 billion in annual revenue for ulcerative colitis alone, plus another $1 billion for MS, Yee says. He puts peak sales in total at $5 billion.
"
686,CELG,"Phase three data for MS is expected in 2017 and for ulcerative colitis in 2018.
"
687,CELG,"Another oral drug, which Celgene acquired last year in a $710 million licensing deal with Dublin, Ireland-based Nogra Pharma, could generate $1 billion as well, Yee says. Known as GED-0301, it treats Crohn's disease. Phase three trials are expected to start in Q3, later than initially planned.
"
688,CELG,"""They have a very robust pipeline of partnerships and new growth drivers, with multiple billion-dollar opportunities over the next five years,"" Yee said.
"
689,CELG,"Earlier this summer, Celgene announced a 10-year collaboration with Juno to develop and commercialize immunotherapies for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases.
"
690,CELG,"Celgene will pay $150 million upfront and buy 9.1 million shares of Juno's stock, at $93 per share. It also has the right to take up to a 30% stake in Juno.
"
691,CELG,"But it's not all full speed ahead. One ""overhang"" on Celgene's stock, notes Flynn, remains the potentially negative impact of a patent dispute that could shave off some of the years when Revlimid is patent-protected.
"
692,CELG,"Celgene is in litigation with Allergan (AGN) over some Revlimid patents that extend through 2019 and 2026. A key challenge is on a patent that now expires in 2026. Pretrial hearings are underway.
"
693,CELG,"Yee expects the two sides to settle before the case goes to court.While drugs for treating and curing hepatitis C have made one biotech company the envy of the industry, another biotech — Celgene — is poised to break ahead of its peer pack over the next few years.Celgene's (CELG) sales and profit growth is seen rising in double digits through at least 2019 from multiple drugs for multiple disorders.Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the biotech firm behind hepatitis C drug Harvoni and its predecessor Sovaldi — is expected to see earnings slow to low single digits over that time starting in 2016 as patients cure out of the liver virus.Other big-cap biotechs, such as Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), will also fall far short of Celgene's expected growth rate, analysts say.""Celgene has the best top-line growth in all of large biotech right now and will have the fastest revenue and earnings growth over the next five years,"" said Michael Yee, managing director and analyst with RBC Capital Markets.'Next Major Mover'?Piper Jaffray analysts told clients in a recent research report that Celgene is ""positioned to be a next major mover among large-cap biotech stocks.""They noted that Celgene is a returning name ""as a top large-cap pick for us.""

723,CELG,"You know the old saying about being in the right place at the right time. Better yet, rather than leaving it to chance, managers of AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund (PGWAX) have aimed for an added boost by putting themselves in that right place. Within their overall investment approach, they've pivoted toward stocks they think will benefit from the Trump presidency and the new Congress.Their reaction already seems to be paying off. The $876 million fund's 3.94% gain over the past month going into Thursday topped 71% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's a big jump up in relative performance over the past 12 months, when the fund's 16.36% gain beat just 30% of its peer group.Since the elections, the fund has boosted its overweight in financials and added to its stake in industrials, says lead manager Karen Hiatt. Also, it has shifted to an underweight in consumer staples. In addition, anticipating an uptick in inflation, the fund is shifting toward the smaller end of large-cap stocks. ""Smaller caps typically outperform in a higher inflation environment,"" Hiatt said.Financials such as banks — especially midsize regional banks — should benefit from rising rates and from a leveling or reduction in their regulatory burden, Hiatt says. The fund's bets in that space include IBD 50 stock First Republic Bank (FRC) and Signature Bank (SBNY).""First Republic and Signature are the same themes,"" Hiatt said. ""First Republic is a really high-quality regional bank. They service high net worth individuals, with a lot of exposure in big cities like New York and the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles.""Shares closed Wednesday above 95. ""We initiated our position at 68 in May,"" Hiatt said. ""We sold out of Wells Fargo (WFC), into First Republic. We sold out of a bank with issues concerning lending, and bought into a bank known for quality lending, being very conservative, having high client retention and high loan growth.""Wells Fargo said this month that new credit card applications had plunged 43% and new checking accounts were down 40% in the fourth quarter vs. a year earlier, in the wake of last year's bad publicity concerning the bank's creation of fake customer accounts.Regional banks are already getting a boost from congressional moves to raise the threshold of the Dodd-Frank Act's systemic risk designation. The existing rule applies to banks with at least $50 billion in assets, subjecting them to costly regulations.""There's been a political push to move that threshold up to $250 billion,"" Hiatt said. ""There's a good shot at getting that, which would help midsize regional banks. The lower threshold is costly, pulling down the ability of smaller banks to grow.""The fund's other holdings also illustrate a best-ideas approach by Hiatt and co-manager Raphael Edelman, since the fund runs a concentrated portfolio. ""We try to keep it below 45 stocks,"" Hiatt said. ""Now it's 40.""The managers look for innovative companies, and they find many in the technology sector. Broadcom (AVGO) is one. On IBD's Leaderboard, the company makes analog and digital semiconductor systems for wireless communications and other applications.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Leaderboard points out that Broadcom's stock has rallied for two weeks. Trading around 202 as of Thursday morning, shares were extended from a 178.12 buy point. The stock's relative strength line has climbed a lot this month, which means Broadcom is outperforming the S&P 500.As IBD recently reported, at least six investment banks recently increased their price targets for the stock. One key reason is Broadcom's three quarters in a row of accelerating earnings growth, thanks largely to gains stem from Broadcom's merger with Avago.Hiatt and Edelman also like Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). ""There is a continued move of advertising dollars from traditional media to digital,"" Hiatt said. ""Google (Alphabet) is underappreciated in what it can do in YouTube, for example. And if Facebook can actually measure the returns that advertisers get on their dollars, that greater visibility of dollar-returns will continue to fuel a shift by advertisers to Facebook.""Mobileye (MBLY) is another innovator. The company develops and supplies technology that interprets what an in-car camera ""sees"" to anticipate and avoid collisions. Its products enhance vehicle safety. The company does not need the advent of fully self-driving cars. On average now, cars use about $200 each in safety equipment. ""That content is rising,"" Hiatt said. ""That's a big driver for Mobileye.""The fund is skeptical about the appeal of most health care stocks. The repeal or rollback of ObamaCare undermines the earnings growth potential of many stocks. So does potential regulatory intervention spawned by drug-pricing controversies. But Hiatt is guardedly comfortable with the fund's Celgene (CELG) holding.""As long as (drug) pricing is a concern, it's hard to see multiple expansion in many health care companies,"" she said. ""But you don't have to see multiple expansion for Celgene to work. It already trades at a (2017 projected consensus) multiple of 15 for 20% annual growth (over the next two to three years). It looks intriguing."" RELATED:Leading Stocks That Are Driving A Hot Mutual Fund's RallyFacebook, Edwards: How AllianzGI Fund Copes With Stingy MarketWhere Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 2017

726,CELG,"SAN FRANCISCO — Less than an hour after President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the drug industry as ""disastrous,"" Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) CEO Randall Schatzman classified the tone at the 35th annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference as ""cautiously optimistic.""That's a wide departure from the 2016 event. At that time, he said, sentiment was decidedly pessimistic as the U.S. entered what turned out to be a raucous election year. The drug-pricing debate is alive, but biotech sentiment is growing stronger this year, Schatzman told IBD in an interview at the conference, one of the drug industry's major events, held this week in San Francisco.""Talking about the biotech industry as a whole, I think it's finally come to maturity,"" he said. ""Over the last two years, almost 70 drugs have been approved that have come from innovation in biotechnology, not large pharma. So the dollars there are really paying us back, and we're seeing some real game-changers.""Among those, Schatzman included Alder's anti-CGRP migraine drug, which competes directly with similar meds from Eli Lilly (LLY), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Amgen (AMGN). The migraine market is big enough that all four could grab a sizable share when their drugs hit shelves, likely in 2019.But he acknowledges Trump's comments didn't help stock prices. Holding his phone, Schatzman pulled up a screen of biotech stocks, red arrows indicating their descent. To that point, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) (an exchange-traded fund) fell 3% Wednesday. It rose a fraction both Thursday and Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary sent drug stocks into a tailspin on Wednesday. Get the deep dive on what it means for your drug and biotech picks on IBD's Industry Themes.So any rally Wall Street expected from the JPMorgan event didn't unfold. But here are five key takeaways investors could note for 2017 as Trump takes office, drug firms look to sidestep Lilly's Alzheimer's flop and M&A gets an early start.Trump isn't alone in his fixation on drug prices. Celgene (CELG) CEO Mark Alles parried back when a reporter questioned whether the No. 3 biotech would follow in Allergan's (AGN) footsteps, applying a so-called ""social contract"" to not raise prices more than 10% annually.Celgene has offered free access programs for years, Alles said, estimating the No. 3 biotech gives away 6% of its drugs each year for free. Drug-prices increases help fund R&D for new drugs, he added. CFO Peter Kellogg estimates Celgene reinvests 35% of its funds into R&D, when accounting for partnerships.Alles says Celgene goes through a ""thoughtful process,"" accounting for innovation and spending to bring a drug to market before it prices a new med. Schatzman used the same words to describe Alder's plan to price out its anti-CGRP drug, once it nears FDA approval and heads to market.But HealthPrize Technologies CEO Tom Kottler called pricing spikes the easy way out for drug companies. HealthPrize is a software-as-a-service firm that marries behavioral economics and consumer marketing to analyze and improve patient adherence to prescriptions.Pharma leaves about $637 billion in worldwide revenue on the table each year by not pushing patients to take their meds, Kottler told IBD. To bridge the gap, companies can bring new products to market, prompt doctors to write more prescriptions or raise prices. Typically, they choose the latter.They're missing out on easy money, Kottler says. But raising prices ""is the easiest thing for them,"" he said.Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced its immuno-oncology (IO) drug Keytruda in combination with chemo — Eli Lilly's Alimta — had won priority review from the FDA in non-small cell lung cancer and has a Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date of May 10.Meanwhile, Merck and Incyte (INCY) are moving Keytruda and epacadostat into phase 3 trials of four tumor types (non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck). Incyte stock jumped 9.4% Jan. 9 on the news.But Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is on Merck's tail, analysts say. Bristol-Myers is testing a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, both IO therapies, in NSCLC. Analysts expect the Bristol-Myers readout in the first half of 2018. IO combos are likely to be more effective and durable than IO plus chemo, some say.On Monday, Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical put down a $24 per share bid on Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIAD), an oncology firm based in Massachusetts. Ariad stock flew 73% on the news, helping shares of oncology firm Tesaro (TSRO) lift 3.7%.Tesaro stock and four IPOs led IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group in 2016, with each of those stocks seeing triple-digit gains. Tesaro jumped 157%, where the group overall fell 24% amid the painful election cycle.Now, analysts wonder if Tesaro's success and an oncology-minded atmosphere — reiterated by Takeda's offer on Ariad — could garner a bid for Tesaro. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez sees a potential takeout price of $170 per share of Tesaro stock, which closed Friday at 156.41 after rising 6.4%.""While Tesaro remains well positioned to grow independently, a validated PARP inhibitor like niraparib (an ovarian cancer drug still in development) could offer a durable and strategically important product opportunity for multiple suitors,"" Fernandez wrote in a research report Jan. 9.Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are asking a federal judge to stay a ban on their LDL-busting drug, Praluent, in the aftermath of a patent battle that landed in a win for No. 1 biotech Amgen. Praluent infringes on Amgen's patent for PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha, the judge said.Meanwhile, an LDL-buster from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO) is slowly advancing. On Jan. 9, The Medicines Co. announced a 180-day interim analysis from a study examining PCSK9si inclisiran. The data showed inclisiran significantly lowered LDL up to day 210.RBC analyst Adnan Butt expects six-month data to be similar on efficacy and safety. Details are expected during the 2017 American College of Cardiology conference in March in Washington, D.C. Inclisiran should do well on strong data despite the patent litigation for Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi.""Inclisiran is differentiated and has no patent litigation overhang,"" Butt said in a research report Wednesday.Axovant (AXON) CEO Vivek Ramaswamy says the biotech and drug industry has ""utterly failed"" in Alzheimer's. Oncology, inflammation, cardiology — they've all seen significant advancements in the last 10 years. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia, including those with lewy bodies, haven't, he says.""If we don't find a treatment, it's a major threat to society,"" he told IBD in an interview Wednesday. ""This is the single area in health care we have failed to deliver a major advancement in, in the last decade.""Ramaswamy says he was rooting for Eli Lilly in December. But Lilly's highly-lauded solanezumab failed to meet its primary endpoints in a late-stage trial, causing Lilly stock to plunge 10.5% the day of that announcement. Lilly's drug and a drug in development by Biogen (BIIB) work to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's.But that's a ""silver bullet"" theory, and Ramaswamy doesn't buy it.

727,CELG,"Thalidomide was infamous for causing birth defects when Celgene (CELG) transformed it into a blood-cancer treatment known as Revlimid that brings in $7 billion a year.Trouble was, Celgene didn't know exactly how Revlimid worked.""We just knew it killed myeloma cells like a gangbuster,"" said Robert Hershberg, Celgene's chief scientific officer.Now the company says it's finally figured out how Revlimid plays a key role in helping the body dispose of certain proteins. If Celgene can harness that discovery, the company says it could lead to new treatments for other cancers, autoimmune disorders and even neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's — not to mention piles of profit.It's far from a done deal. If the company's scientists fail, the drugmaker will look like it's stuck in the past, unable to let go of the drug that made it great. Celgene, whose shares were down more than 4% Wednesday on President-elect Donald Trump's vow to lower drug prices, will also be left with a gap to fill. Celgene finished the day off 4.73 to 112.66.Patent protection for Revlimid expires in the next decade, and its revenue is expected to fall off a cliff in 2026. Given the years it takes to develop a drug from lab to market, Celgene is under pressure to show investors its pipeline can feed the company's growth.The stakes are big, not only for Celgene and its bottom line but for millions of patients for whom treatments can be elusive. It's also a test for a new protocol called ""precision medicine,"" which aims to match patients with drugs based on factors such as genetics. Understanding exactly how a drug works in an individual patient's body is critical in successful prescribing.""The medicine of the future is not using sledgehammer approaches,"" said Celgene board member Gilla Kaplan. ""It's going to be the ability to identify the groups of patients that respond best and minimize the toxic effects. What Celgene is trying to do is stay on top of the crest.""Kaplan worked on thalidomide, Revlimid's predecessor, in the 1980s and '90s, originally developing it as a leprosy treatment. At the time, thalidomide was tainted. In 1961 it was taken off the market after being linked to thousands of children born with flipper-like limbs after their mothers took the drug as an anti-nausea medication during pregnancy.In 1991, Kaplan and fellow researchers at Rockefeller University showed that thalidomide inhibited a molecule that could make it a warrior against AIDS. But the side effects were a major hurdle, and other companies brought AIDS drugs to market first. Nobody wanted the drug, but Celgene was paying attention. The drugmaker bought it. After years of work to remove its toxic effects, Revlimid became available in 2005.Sales of Revlimid and its cousin, Pomalyst, another thalidomide derivative, have increased steadily. Pomalyst is also used to fight multiple myeloma, and has been successful for patients who relapsed after taking Revlimid.But how do the drugs work? The answer lies in the garbage-disposal system of cells.All living cells are constantly manufacturing proteins to watch out for viruses, carry messages around the body or help repair damaged cells. But cells also need a way to discard unwanted proteins. The trash man in this case is a molecule group called the E3 ligase. The E3 ligase has a molecule called cereblon that sticks out like a hook and grabs onto a matching protein. When the E3 ligase gets hold of the protein, it ""tags"" it for a trip to the dump.Thalidomide, Revlimid and Pomalyst work by modifying the shape of the hook. That way, the hook can tag different types of proteins for the garbage heap.Now that Celgene understands this, it's working on redesigning the shape of the hook so it can tag different proteins. In theory, Celgene could modify the drug to ""snag and tag"" all sorts of unwanted proteins for destruction.The Summit, N.J.-based company has said publicly that it has three drugs currently in the pipeline: CC-122 for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, CC-220 for lupus, and CC-90009 for acute myeloid leukemia. Hershberg said the company also has another myeloma drug in the works and more potential treatments the company hasn't revealed.IBD'S TAKE: After steadily declining since July 2015, Celgene shares broke out the day after Trump's election on the prospect he would favor biotechs. But statements this week saying he'd take on drugmakers caused shares to drop again Wednesday. Celgene ranks fifth among companies in IBD's Biomed/Biotech Group, with Biospecifics Technologies (BSTC) rated first.Celgene investors and observers have shown different levels of excitement over the next-generation Revlimids.""Celgene is doing everything right,"" said Jeff Ross, a radiologist and founder of Vailshire Capital Management LLC, a family fund with about $6 million under management. He said Revlimid and its next-generation successors will continue to be Celgene's golden goose. ""They have collaborative partnerships and internal research and development to cement their leadership into the next decade.""More skeptical is Cowen & Co. analyst Eric Schmidt, who wrote a scathing note after attending a September Celgene presentation.""Why is cereblon an optimal target within this pathway?"" he wrote. ""What is the connection between cereblon and a specific disease state? In other words, other than the fact that cereblon turned out to be the molecular target of two great myeloma drugs (Revlimid and Pomalyst) why should investors believe the target has utility in any other indication?""Celgene is ""still shooting in the dark when it comes to how to apply this class of compounds to drug development,"" Schmidt wrote.Not so, said Mark Alles, Celgene's chief executive officer.""I would say we're in a room that's dark but there are several night lights on that give us insights into what our future can be,"" Alles said in an interview. ""We feel like we're in a much better position, as opposed to the serendipity of the past.""Schmidt still has an outperform rating, equivalent to a buy recommendation, for Celgene. He's more convinced by Celgene's other bets — partnerships with smaller biotechnology firms and acquisitions of outside assets that it's made over the years.So Celgene will still have a business, even if Revlimid's next generation fails. But Alles says Revlimid remains the heart and soul of the company.""Without a doubt it's the cornerstone therapeutic, it's who we are today,"" Alles said. Understanding protein creation and destruction ""is the sun in the solar system we're building. That's our strategic future.""

That should drive sales for health care providers and services.

But now, with China and a global slowdown on their minds, investors are more focused on downside risk.They may be right to be cautious.""While value stocks are at risk should economic growth estimates continue to come down, momentum companies are exposed to more spikes in volatility,"" which has weighed on biotechs lately, Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, wrote recently.He suggested investors consider quality stocks — ""which generally have strong return on equity and low debt"" — for successful investing if the markets stay choppy.Analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research agree.In a new report, they say health care rates as the most attractive sector based on measures that have historically been best at predicting results, such as EPS and sales revisions, guidance and the prior quarter's results.Stick with health care to stick with quality, BofA Merrill Lynch advised.

823,CELG,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) fell early Monday, before reversing sharply later in the session,  after the company's forecast for sales of its cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi lagged Wall Street expectations.On Sunday, Vertex said it expected full-year sales of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the drug, while analysts had been forecasting $1.45 billion, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in an email to clients on Sunday. But Scotti said Vertex's numbers were ""likely closer"" to the expectations of buy-side analysts (mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds and others).Vertex released its forecast ahead of its presentation Monday at the 35th annual JPMorgan (JPM) Healthcare Conference, which is one of the biggest events of the year for biotech and other drug companies. The conference, in San Francisco, starts Monday and ends Thursday, and most of the major companies will be present.Other companies with executives making presentations Monday include Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Celgene (CELG).IBD'S TAKE: It's rare that not a single drugmaker is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks, but that is the case at this time of uncertainty for an industry facing possibly changes in health care laws and perhaps, as IBD has reported, legislation on drug prices. Check out IBD 50 to learn which stocks have been performing better than any others.Vertex stock fell as much as 2.9% in early trading in the stock market today, but it ended the day at 82.86, up 4.4%, regaining its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. Vertex stock had a rough 2016, with shares falling more than 40% as some quarterly results disappointed and it had mixed results with its drug trials.The company's Q1 sales outlook for Orkambi, launched in 2015, also missed Wall Street forecasts.In any case, with sales of $1 billion-plus, Orkambi is a blockbuster. It's a combination of ivacaftor, another treatment for cystic fibrosis that Vertex markets separately as Kalydeco, and lumacaftor, a booster that makes the drug effective in treating a much larger population than ivacaftor alone. Annual treatments for both Orkambi and Kalydeco cost $200,000 plus.Vertex's guidance for 2017 sales of Kalydeco at $690 million to $710 million also missed, with Wall Street expecting $734 million, Scotti said.RELATED:Trump Pledges To Bring Down Drug PricesWhich Biotechs Outperformed In Tough 2016

826,CELG,"Data from No. 1 biotech Amgen's (AMGN) LDL-busting drug could boost Regeneron (REGN) in 2017, but disappoint the too-high expectations of Amgen investors, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Tuesday.Young upgraded Regeneron stock to an outperform rating and upped her price target to 485 from 481, citing the April launch of dupixent, an eczema drug with Sanofi (SNY). But PCSK9 data from top rival Amgen due in Q1 also could also be a catalyst for Regeneron's own PCSK9 drug, she wrote in a research report.Amgen investors, however, have set their expectations too high on Repatha, Amgen's PCSK9 inhibitor, following successful data from a study in September, she said. In that coronary intravascular imaging trial, Repatha met its primary and secondary endpoints in coronary artery disease.""We still see some upside into Repatha outcomes data in 1Q17,"" she wrote in a research note. ""We think the risk/reward is unfavorable since expectations are pretty high after success of the GLAGOV study.""IBD'S TAKE: Will Trump break with Republicans to pressure drug prices? It's looking more and more likely he will. Will biotechs survive the political pressure?Young downgraded Amgen stock to a neutral rating and cut her price target to 180 from 200. She sees Amgen's base business — rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel — becoming weaker and trimmed her total product-sales view by $670 million.Enbrel sales came in flat in Q3 at $1.45 billion amid contract negotiations. Next year, Enbrel sales will be driven on volume rather than net selling price, the company said on its Q3 earnings conference call with analysts. Though the company upped its 2016 guidance at that time.Celgene (CELG) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) top Young's 2017 biotech watchlist. She is cautious on 2017 in general, however, given comments from President-elect Donald Trump that he will go after escalating drug prices. In the six weeks following his election, biotech and drug stocks have nearly round-tripped, first rising and then falling.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group hit a six-week high on Nov. 14 after Trump's election, but is down 9% since then. Still, shares remain 5% above their close on Nov. 8, rising 0.85% in the stock market today. Amgen stock fell 0.35% Tuesday to 147.22, while Regeneron stock slipped 0.20% to 371.02.""We don't expect drug pricing chatter to moderate, especially considering comments already made by the president-elect,"" Young wrote.

835,CELG,"Investors in ETFs are starting to show appetite for risk after lavishing money on defensive, dividend-paying stocks for months on end. And few segments of the stock market have fed such cravings as much as biotech.SPDR S&P Biotechnology (XBI) jumped 6.7% in the past week through Thursday, as growth stocks began to act better. It's up 8.8% quarter to date. But after a steep sell-off for biotechs in the first quarter, XBI sits 38% below its 52-week high.Still, some market watchers think the biotech group could strike a winning note again.The flow of investor money is said to follow performance. XBI certainly needs it -- it has leaked $179.2 million in the second quarter so far, and assets have shrunk nearly 17% in 2016 to $1.88 billion.This biotech ETF is for the investor who's hungry for returns and not afraid to take on more risk.""The portfolio is skewed more toward smaller-cap, early-stage biotech firms, which have decidedly uncertain prospects but explosive upside potential,"" writes Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough.XBI holds three highly rated IBD stocks that are spearheading the recent rebound in the biotech group:Ligand has grown earnings at an annual rate of 113% in the past three years, with sales up 28%. It has a 97 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99, thanks in part to its 30% share price jump over the past three months and heavy institutional buying.While earnings growth slowed in the most recent quarter, it averaged 150% over the past three stanzas. Sales growth accelerated in the last three quarters.The drugmaker is embroiled in fending off Sanofi's (SNY) hostile takeover bid. Biotech giants Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) were also said to be possibly joining the fray.The company plans to separate into two publicly traded companies. One company will focus on biodefense products, while the other will revolve around oncology and hematology therapeutics.Emergent has a three-year EPS growth rate of 35% and a three-year sales growth rate of 29%. That helps it to a Comp Rating of 96.Ligand, Medivation and Emergent are among 88 stocks in the XBI portfolio.XBI is one of the cheapest biotech ETFs, with a 0.35% expense ratio.It has produced a 15.4% annual average gain over the past two years vs. 8.1% for the flagship iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB).IBB is cap-weighted and skews toward larger players in the biotech industry, including Celgene and Gilead. It has lower beta than XBI, making it a slightly safer way to play this volatile industry.In the past week, IBB added 5.7%. Quarter to date, this ETF is up 4.9%.

836,CELG,"Sentiment on biotech stocks overall ebbs and flows, but biotech companies can carve very individual paths. Drug company investors look to product pipelines to spot potential growth, especially for scientifically novel assets that can stand out from the pack.These three biotech stocks have outperformed the group in the past few months thanks to potential blockbuster drugs.• Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) is up 68% since its early February all-time low -- which was also the IBD Medical-Biomed/Biotech group's nearly two-year low point -- as investors have regained confidence in its cancer-fighting pipeline. Juno is working in the cutting-edge field of cell therapy, in which patients' own cells are re-engineered to help their immune systems kill cancer cells, in this case the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells.This is Why Biotech Stocks May Explode AgainJuno's leading candidate, JCAR015, is in midstage testing for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, for which it showed stunning success rates in earlier trials. Last month, its partner Celgene (CELG) said it would exercise its option to commercialize JCAR015 and two similar candidates outside of North America and China, under a 10-year, $1 billion partnership that the two companies inked last summer.Also last month, Juno showed off some of its earlier-stage CAR-T candidates at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, targeting different receptors in other types of blood cancer. When the abstracts for the meeting were released in March, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote that Juno's stock should be supported by ""clinical data readouts supporting Juno's business strategy to develop differentiated, potentially best-in-class CAR-T products that could generate translational insights in hematologic and solid tumor indications.""• BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) is up 29% since its early February 20-month low as it recovered from the FDA's rejection of its muscular-dystrophy drug Kyndrisa in January. At its R&D day last month, BioMarin rolled out strong early data for two pipeline candidates, one for hemophilia and one for achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism.The hemophilia data brought particular attention, as it was the first-ever evidence on gene therapy for the disease in humans. After the therapy, BMN 270, was delivered once to eight patients, all of their conditions went from severe to mild-to-moderate.This was far better than expected. In a video recorded for clients a couple of weeks later, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti described the mood at BioMarin's event: ""When they started presenting (the data), jaws just went to the floor. There was an audible gasp in the room.""The market for hemophilia A, the most common type, runs at $4 billion a year. Analysts say a successful gene therapy could massively disrupt the market of clotting factors that have to be infused weekly at least.• Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) is up 52% from its 28-month low in February, after its lead drug Ocaliva passed a major hurdle to market last month. An FDA advisory committee voted to grant it accelerated approval for a liver condition called primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), which the agency has until May 29 to decide on.While the PBC market is expected to bring in a healthy revenue stream for Intercept, the potential blockbuster indication is in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a liver-scarring disease that affects millions of Americans but has no treatment. Intercept is conducting a large phase-three trial of Ocaliva in the disease, with a launch not expected for several years. But the FDA panel vote did imply that the experts see the benefits as outweighing the drug's known safety issues.Ocaliva's potential has driven buyout speculation around Intercept stock, which has also helped to push up shares. A particular burst of this came on Feb. 12 when anonymous sources suggested that the company was exploring a sale, though nothing's yet come of it.

837,CELG,"Big-cap drug stocks Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Celgene (CELG) were both rising after their Q1 earnings reports early Thursday, though Celgene initially dropped as it delivered a long-expected guidance cut.Bristol-Myers reported earnings of 74 cents a share, minus one-time items, up 4% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by nine cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $4.39 billion, about $140 million above Wall Street's average estimate.Bristol-Myers added 20 cents to its full-year EPS guidance, now $2.40 to $2.60. It expects revenue to grow in the low double-digit range, which would be the first time since 1997 that annual sales gained that much.Recently launched cancer drug Opdivo beat sales estimates by a substantial margin -- $704 million vs. analysts' $587 million -- up from just $40 million in the year-earlier quarter. Anti-clotting drug Eliquis also handily beat expectations, with sales more than doubling to $734 million.Bristol-Myers stock was up more than 3% in  afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 72.50, its highest point since October 1999.Celgene, meanwhile, reported Q1 sales of $2.51 billion, a 21% gain on last year's Q1 but almost $60 million below consensus. On the other hand, EPS beat estimates by five cents, rising 23% to $1.32.Celgene added 10 cents to its full-year earnings guidance, now $5.60-$5.70 a share, and raised the low end of its product-sales guidance to $10.75 billion-$11 billion. However, it trimmed its 2017 guidance to account for foreign-exchange headwinds. It now expects sales of $12.7 billion to $13 billion, vs. $13 billion-$14 billion previously. Celgene also cut its EPS target to $6.75-$7.00 from $7.25.The company affirmed its previously issued 2020 guidance.Celgene stock dropped in early trading but was up more than 2%, above 108, by early afternoon Thursday. Wall Street had anticipated the 2017 guidance cut.""Investors will be looking for an update on 2017 guidance following the $700 million to $800 million FX headwind on top-line revenues mentioned on their 4Q 2015 call,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in a preview note Wednesday. ""Celgene neither revised nor reaffirmed 2017 guidance at that time and may provide an update to their current guidance.""On the conference call with analysts Thursday, Celgene's management said that on a constant-currency basis, financials are tracking to hit their original targets.

838,CELG,"After being one of the worst-performing sectors since last summer, biotechnology firms have shown a few encouraging signs since March.ETF flow into the sector was a positive $480 million in March, according to Mizuho Securities USA data. Then, the last two weeks of April saw an additional $454 million inflow, trimming outflow for the month to a net $239 million.""There are 14 biotech ETFs in total, controlling almost $10 billion of assets, and in the first two months -- because it was a risk-off momentum across the board -- $2.1 billion departed,"" said Monish Shah, Mizuho Securities USA executive director and head of ETF trading. ""In the last week (of April), which was again a risk-off momentum, biotech ETFs did not see a major outflow technically.""So is this a propitious time to start looking at biotech ETFs again?Flows into biotech ETFs were a positive $23 million in the second week of May, but that gave way to a $39 million outflow in the third week, through Thursday.Shah advises investors to be careful in the near term, even though the sector's long-term prospect is good. ""The trend seems to be holding up, but I advise near-term caution, because there are many positive as well as some negative factors.""The two largest biotech ETFs, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) were in the positive flow territory through the end of April, adding a net $221 million and $85 million, respectively. The $6.2 billion IBB is down 1.06% in the past three months, and the $1.7 billion XBI is up 5%. They are still a respective 35% and 42% below their 52-week highs.IBB has slipped below its 50-day moving average, a bearish sign, while XBI is testing resistance at its own 50-day line.Next in line are $821 million First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech ETF (FBT) and $511 million VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH). They're up roughly a respective 4% and 1% in the past three months. However, FBT experienced strong outflow each of the first four months of 2016, resulting in a net outflow of $1.75 billion. BHH saw some positive flow in April, but ended with a net $57 million outflow over the same period.As with the first two funds, FBT and BBH are also both testing resistance at their 50-day lines.A series of positive factors are, however, in the pipeline for biotechs. ""The P/E ratios have been coming down. That may suggest to some investors that stocks are more reasonably valued,"" said Michael Cohick, ETF product manager at Van Eck Global. He also notes that biotechs are poised to benefit from the continuing demographic factors of an aging population. Also, with the Affordable Care Act, more people are now covered by insurance and can afford some of the new therapies.""That, along with the incredible continued innovation that's coming out of the companies in the sector themselves, I think may point to potential entry points,"" said Cohick.That said, the sector is known for displaying very high volatility. ""From terrible terrible negative performance in January to slightly negative in February (to a positive performance in March and April for the VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF), ... the short-term performance story has returned,"" said Cohick. ""But I would suggest investors should always continue to monitor the biotech company earnings, as well as the M&A activity.""That's why he prefers a concentrated portfolio of the 25 largest and most liquid biotech stocks, such as represented in BBH. ""If you want the safety of the larger companies, it may be a better way to play the sector,"" he said.The fund's top holdings are Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Medivation (MDVN), together representing about 45% of the fund's assets.

Goldman doesn't see any big near-term catalysts, though, since the next Model 3 update may not come until 2017. Goldman saysTesla shares closed up 3.2% on the stock market today but dropped 3% in late trading after Tesla announced a secondary stock offering.Argus Research raised Exxon's rating to buy from hold with a 104 price target. Crude oil futures have rallied in recent weeks on signs the global supply glut may be easing, as well as production disruptions in Canada and Nigeria.Exxon shares closed down 0.2% as crude futures dipped.TJX, which beat earnings on Tuesday and sees lots of room for expanding its store base, saw its price target bumped up to 84 from 82 at RBC Capital Markets.The off-price retailer's stock fell 1.15% after rising 0.5% Tuesday.Cigna, which is aiming to close its merger with rival health insurer Anthem (ANTM), was kept at sector perform at RBC, with the price target hiked to 174 from 169.Last week, Cigna reached a deal to pay Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron (REGN) based on how well their customers respond to the drugmakers' cholesterol-lowering treatments.Cigna shares fell 0.7%.Sun Trust kept a buy on Agios, while raising its target to 65 from 57.

840,CELG,"Hillary Clinton's vow to cap patients' out-of-pocket prescription costs at $250 a month may sound like a populist way to help consumers while sticking it to drug companies.
"
841,CELG,"But the reality is it would raise premiums and modestly reduce the ranks of the insured, partly by pushing some small businesses to drop coverage. And, believe it or not, it's exactly what drug companies want.
"
842,CELG,"As an example of how her plan would work, Clinton's presidential campaign points to Covered California. Starting in 2016, the state's ObamaCare insurance exchange will cap an individual's cost for any single covered drug at $250 a month under benchmark silver-level plans.
"
843,CELG,"By itself, the California plan could raise premiums by up to 3% over three years, state officials have acknowledged. But Clinton's plan would go further by capping a consumer's total out-of-pocket cost for one or more drugs at $250 a month, not the cost for a single drug.
"
844,CELG,"Intended Or Unintended?
"
845,CELG,"Cowen & Co. analysts pointed out that ordinary Americans don't face significant monthly prescription costs and ""will end up subsidizing those that do, as premiums and co-pays rise,"" under Clinton's $250-per-month limit.
"
846,CELG,"""We think that's a significant unintended (or maybe intended) consequence that would arise from this cap and would face significant opposition,"" according to a Cowen report Tuesday.
"
847,CELG,"One implication of the Democratic front-runner's plan is that she would make low-cost employer plans pricier, which will increase the incentive for employers to either pay the mandate penalty or figure out ways of avoiding it, such as hiring more part-time workers.
"
848,CELG,"The key is that ObamaCare's employer mandate requires companies to offer coverage that is at least as comprehensive as bronze-level exchange plans (which still leave customers on the hook for up to $6,500 in drug costs a year in California).
"
849,CELG,"That means Clinton's proposal to hold out-of-pocket drug costs to $250 a month would have to apply to bronze plans as well.
"
850,CELG,"Higher premiums as a result of that cap could then result in more costs being shifted to the relatively young and healthy for whom big prescription bills are much less common.
"
851,CELG,"That's a risky strategy, considering that young-adult enrollment on the ObamaCare exchanges is 2 million below target. Partly as a result of this relatively older and not-so-healthy group of enrollees, average premiums are expected to rise by more than 10% in 2016.
"
852,CELG,"Drugmakers Support Caps
"
853,CELG,"Additional premium hikes to get healthy young adults to subsidize more of the cost of prescriptions could further dampen enrollment, as more people choose to go without coverage that they see as a bad deal.
"
854,CELG,"Biotech stocks continued to slide Tuesday, due in part to Clinton's attack on ""outrageous"" drug pricing. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) closed down 1.5%, after falling 4.5% on Monday. Amgen (AMGN) dipped 0.8%, adding to Monday's 2.3% loss.
"
855,CELG,"Yet drugmakers have been quietly supporting campaigns to cap out-of-pocket costs for drugs, which would help expand access to their products.
"
856,CELG,"Pfizer (PFE) and Celgene (CELG) have provided funding to groups pushing for co-pay limits, including Cap the Copay and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. A number of states have enacted such limits in the past couple of years, including Montana, Delaware, Maryland, Louisiana and Maine.
"
857,CELG,"Meanwhile, the insurance industry has been firmly against the idea and warns that caps at low levels without controls on drug prices will raise premiums.
"
858,CELG,"Clinton wants to rein in drug prices, too, but analysts were highly skeptical that her proposals to allow imports of prescription drugs and let Medicare negotiate drug prices could get enough support in Congress. Republicans have opposed those ideas as discouraging innovative cures.Hillary Clinton's vow to cap patients' out-of-pocket prescription costs at $250 a month may sound like a populist way to help consumers while sticking it to drug companies.But the reality is it would raise premiums and modestly reduce the ranks of the insured, partly by pushing some small businesses to drop coverage.

But Clinton's plan would go further by capping a consumer's total out-of-pocket cost for one or more drugs at $250 a month, not the cost for a single drug.Intended Or Unintended?Cowen & Co. analysts pointed out that ordinary Americans don't face significant monthly prescription costs and ""will end up subsidizing those that do, as premiums and co-pays rise,"" under Clinton's $250-per-month limit.""We think that's a significant unintended (or maybe intended) consequence that would arise from this cap and would face significant opposition,"" according to a Cowen report Tuesday.One implication of the Democratic front-runner's plan is that she would make low-cost employer plans pricier, which will increase the incentive for employers to either pay the mandate penalty or figure out ways of avoiding it, such as hiring more part-time workers.The key is that ObamaCare's employer mandate requires companies to offer coverage that is at least as comprehensive as bronze-level exchange plans (which still leave customers on the hook for up to $6,500 in drug costs a year in California).That means Clinton's proposal to hold out-of-pocket drug costs to $250 a month would have to apply to bronze plans as well.Higher premiums as a result of that cap could then result in more costs being shifted to the relatively young and healthy for whom big prescription bills are much less common.That's a risky strategy, considering that young-adult enrollment on the ObamaCare exchanges is 2 million below target. Partly as a result of this relatively older and not-so-healthy group of enrollees, average premiums are expected to rise by more than 10% in 2016.Drugmakers Support CapsAdditional premium hikes to get healthy young adults to subsidize more of the cost of prescriptions could further dampen enrollment, as more people choose to go without coverage that they see as a bad deal.Biotech stocks continued to slide Tuesday, due in part to Clinton's attack on ""outrageous"" drug pricing. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) closed down 1.5%, after falling 4.5% on Monday. Amgen (AMGN) dipped 0.8%, adding to Monday's 2.3% loss.Yet drugmakers have been quietly supporting campaigns to cap out-of-pocket costs for drugs, which would help expand access to their products.Pfizer (PFE) and Celgene (CELG) have provided funding to groups pushing for co-pay limits, including Cap the Copay and the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. A number of states have enacted such limits in the past couple of years, including Montana, Delaware, Maryland, Louisiana and Maine.Meanwhile, the insurance industry has been firmly against the idea and warns that caps at low levels without controls on drug prices will raise premiums.Clinton wants to rein in drug prices, too, but analysts were highly skeptical that her proposals to allow imports of prescription drugs and let Medicare negotiate drug prices could get enough support in Congress. Republicans have opposed those ideas as discouraging innovative cures.

888,CELG,"The European Union's medical advisory committee endorsed several key drugs from leading stocks Friday, making EU approval likely for some potential blockbusters: The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, known by its French abbreviation, CHMP, adopted a positive opinion on Gilead Sciences ' (GILD) Genvoya to manage HIV infection. Genvoya is a four-drug combo pill identical to Gilead's popular treatment Stribild, except that in place of one ingredient, Viread, Gilead has put its new drug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).TAF is known around Wall Street as ""son of Viread"" because it's a similar compound, but altered so that a lower dose can be used which in turn reduces side effects. Crucially for Gilead, it also won't hit Viread's patent expiries, which are due to start in 2018. As Stribild's sales passed $1 billion last year and are expected to top $2 billion next year, this is a key revenue driver even for a company as big as Gilead. The CHMP also endorsed two blood-cancer drugs from Amgen (AMGN). Kyprolis, which Amgen got when it acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013, was first approved for multiple myeloma in the U.S. in 2012 but hasn't yet hit the market in the European Union. While it was first approved as a lone treatment, Amgen has been pushing a combo of Kyprolis with Celgene's (CELG) Revlimid and dexamethasone, based on a successful new trial in patients who've received at least one prior therapy. The FDA approved this combo in July.Kyprolis isn't a big revenue driver for the big biotech now, but analysts expect annual sales to hit $1.7 billion by 2020.The CHMP also backed a newer drug, Blincyto, for certain types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Blincyto is a bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) antibody, which combine bits of two different antibodies to engage the body's T cells to attack cancer cells.Analyst expectations aren't huge for Blinctyo, but Amgen recently cut a licensing deal to use Xencor's (XNCR) longer-lasting BiTE technology to develop newer, better drugs. Vertex Pharmaceuticals' (VRTX) Orkambi for cystic fibrosis also got the CHMP thumbs-up Friday. Orkambi gained a fair bit of media attention when it won its U.S. approval in July, as cystic fibrosis is a devastating disease with few treatments, which gives Vertex considerable pricing power. The consensus calls for annual sales to pass $5 billion by 2020.""Our models already reflect an Orkambi launch in Europe in early 2016 for CF patients 12 and older (n=12,000),"" wrote Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert in a research note. ""However, we anticipate a slower launch trajectory than in the U.S. (n=8,500) due to the need to obtain reimbursement on a country-by-country basis."" Speaking of orphan diseases, Horizon Pharma's (HZNP) Ravicti also got a CHMP endorsement as a treatment for ultra-rare urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Ravicti was one of the drugs that Horizon acquired with its $1.1 billion of Hyperion Therapeutics this year, and one that Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem highlighted as a potential growth driver on March 31 when the deal was announced.""Ravicti was approved by the FDA in February 2013, and now has sales annualizing to around $105 million,"" Amsellem wrote. ""According to Hyperion, the U.S. prevalence of UCD is around 2,100. Hyperion has estimated that only around 1,100 UCD patients are actually diagnosed, and only around 675 are on treatment.""Ravicti costs $330,000 a year in the U.S., but Amsellem pointed out that's not that steep for an orphan drug and Horizon could price it higher. He did not estimate European pricing, however.Despite these endorsements, all the stocks were down on the stock market today as drug stocks continued their recent bumpy ride. In afternoon trading Friday, Gilead and Amgen shares were down 2%, and Vertex and Horizon stocks were both down 6%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

889,CELG,"For clues about ways to fight the current up-and-down market, take a look at the investment strategy of mutual funds that have outperformed over the long haul.The $8 billion American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) beat 66% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 52 weeks going into Friday. Over the past three years, the fund's 11.38% average annual gain topped 80% of its peers, which averaged 9.48%, while the S&P 500 averaged 10.41%.The fund seeks highly profitable companies that look poised to keep growing. It aims for large, industry-leading companies that have sustainable accelerating earnings growth and positive price momentum.Where does the fund expect the best odds of finding such companies? A look at the fund's portfolio weightings offers a clue: As of March 31, managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeff Bourke had their key overweights in the information technology and health care sectors. In tech, the fund was finding opportunities in Internet software and services, IT services and communications equipment.The fund's top 10 holdings reflect that tilt toward tech and health care. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) were the top four as of Feb. 29. The top 10 also included health care names UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).Social networking giant Facebook is still in a buy range from a 117.09 buy point after gapping up April 28 on strong earnings.Its recent action in the stock market is not perfect. Its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a C- from a worst-possible E, but the weak rating is still a sign of more recent selling than buying by mutual funds over the past 13 weeks.But earnings-per-share growth has sped up, going from 16% four quarters ago to 33%, 46% and 83% in the past three frames, respectively.And the stock's IBD Composite Rating is a solid 99. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest.Managed health-care services provider UnitedHealth's EPS rebounded to 17% growth in the most recent stanza after falling 15% in the previous quarter.Shares are up 13% over the past 52 weeks, even after falling nearly 1% on Thursday as a federal judge ruled that the Obama administration is unconstitutionally spending federal money to fund ObamaCare.Shares of many key health care stocks went down after the decision. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer's ruling was a win for House Republicans who brought the legal challenge. The government was slated to pay $175 billion over 10 years to health insurers, lowering copayments for lower-income people.Robotic surgical system developer Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is a health care name that was unharmed by the ObamaCare ruling. Shares rose nearly 1% on Thursday. They're up more than 28% over the past 52 weeks.The stock's EPS grew a respective 34%, 20% and 24% over the past three quarters.Bank of America/Merrill Lynch recently said Intuitive was one of 16 S&P 500 stocks that could soon start paying a dividend. It cited the company's low debt compared with its industry, at least 2% of its market cap coming from cash, a stable earnings trend and EPS growth the prior fiscal year, as well as growth expected in the current year.
"
890,CELG,"Before Valeant Pharmaceuticals recently cracked up over accounting and management issues, one of the most controversial aspects of its business model was its attitude toward research and development spending.Valeant (VRX) would typically pare to the bone the R&D operations of companies it acquired, and chided big pharmas for their allegedly wasteful spending on research. Historically its R&D spending was just 3% of sales. By contrast, the R&D budget of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) last year totaled 36% of sales, Pfizer's (PFE) was nearly 16% and big biotech Celgene's (CELG) was a whopping 40%.But what is really the appropriate spending level for R&D -- and how should it be spent? IBD recently asked Jonathan Gertler, a former biotech entrepreneur who advises companies on just this issue as managing partner of Back Bay Life Science Advisors.IBD: Looking over pharma in general, do you think they're spending the right amount on R&D? Too much? Too little?Gertler: I tend to divide R&D into two categories broadly.There's the R&D that really is focused on new technology, true biologically driven solutions for diseases. I think that level of spending is appropriate. I think increasingly, the collaborations between smaller and larger companies and the collaborations that are truly advancing between companies and academia really are focused on R&D that's going to be meaningful in terms of overall national health and international health, and really driving significant solutions.There is still a tendency, in some companies, to look for follow-on commercial pharmaceutical solutions. You see that ranging from the private equity world all the way up through large pharma and specialty pharma, where it's probably less innovation-driven. And although those dollars are still well spent in terms of the company's viability, in terms of a primary research agenda they're probably less important than the new biologically driven therapies.IBD: Another issue is whether companies want to do the R&D in-house or basically buy it by buying a company. Do you have any general guidelines on that?Gertler: In that I would categorize it into three main groups: the smaller companies that are innovation-driven and somewhat capital-constrained; the midcaps that have had success with aspects of their platform, that either have the chance to focus in on that platform alone, and start to diversify around the platform; and, of course, the global pharma companies.I think there was a lot of emphasis over the last number of years about outsourcing R&D entirely. Our system doesn't work that way. Our system is, at this juncture, a very continuous ecosystem where you have many academics who have gone over to Big Pharma, driving significant R&D efforts; academics who are involved in early-stage companies; and seasoned executives from large companies moving into small companies.The lifeblood of small companies is identifying that which they can really develop, based on either platform or assets, within capital constraints. But then the relationships with the larger companies, where they become the outsourced R&D, is critical. The expertise within those large companies -- which should not be eradicated -- that has to do with R&D, and then ultimately commercial development, should influence the way those smaller companies act.The flip side of that is that large companies that have to focus -- just by the way they're judged by investors on the Street -- on near-term commercial or commercial successes, still have to make sure that the pipeline is intact. If you eradicate R&D functionality from large companies, or significantly hamper it, you won't have the proper means of identifying those smaller platforms that are going to be truly valuable five and 10 years down the line. And also, you won't be able to help those smaller platforms both maintain their own organic growth while at the same time partnering out or licensing out to broaden the way the platform can have an impact.So I think the discussion of outsourced R&D vs. in-house R&D has become artificial. Our world at this juncture is too fluid and too sophisticated to justify that binary type of approach.IBD: There's also been a lot of talk about R&D efficiency, and whether some companies are wasting their resources. What's your impression on that?Gertler: First of all, I think that drug development is by nature a somewhat messy business. You can try to have an extremely strict, receptor-driven drug in development, but inevitably that will either have too small of an impact in terms of disease outcome, or will have too promiscuous effects on other systems, and then have too much collateral damage associated with its development. So inevitably, just by virtue of the biology, there's going to be significant inefficiency in the process.I think that smaller companies sometimes do suffer from inefficiency. Their platforms can be very promising, but smaller companies sometimes lose sight of the best way to prove the concept of the platform, which may be economically smaller and tighter, and yet still really open up the platform once you've gone over that first inflection-point hurdle into larger things.From a large-company perspective, I think there are certainly many steps along the way, whether it's in early-stage discovery or preclinical and early clinical development where many things will help us in the years to come -- and those include biomarkers, and those include imaging processes for diseases and a greater understanding of selective biology for disease -- that will, with the advance of knowledge, make our system more efficient.Doubtless there are inefficiencies in the systems that are due to bureaucracy, and the way things are judged. But I think the primary inefficiency is that drug discovery is, in and of itself, a messy business.IBD: What sort of advice would you give to the nonspecialist investor about judging a company's R&D program?Gertler: If you're looking at large companies, there are a lot of drivers of value for the public investor that probably go well beyond R&D. But I still think that using even a simple formula about percentage of R&D spend is probably not the way investors should look at those companies.I think that they should divide them into two areas. Those that are focused on R&D that's really not primary pharmaceutical or biotech R&D -- it has more to do with either me-too drugs or repurposed or reformulated drugs; I think those are less attractive investments. But if you look at larger companies that are really trying to fill the pipeline in a way that makes clinical sense -- those are the ones (where), regardless of percentage of R&D spend, there is probably greater interest in having long-term support.The reason I say that is that as our health care system changes continually -- and it inevitably will -- we'll have to have systems wherein drugs will have to have higher impact (and) better outcomes, and truly be differentiated to justify reimbursement and support. If you're not a company that's focused on that sort of targeted innovation, in the long run you're not going to do as well.You also have to look at these companies and say, ""What is coming out in terms of news in the near term? And is that news going be impactful to the sector it's targeting?"" Meaning: Is it a me-too drug, or is it a sixth-to-market drug that really is going to (have to) prove huge differentiation to make a difference? I think that would be less appealing. Or is it a drug that actually is addressing a significant unmet need, with a more-than-incremental mechanistic change, and where success there will also offer broader opportunity? Those are still the metrics that, even as as generalist investor in a public pharma company, I would bring to bear.For the midcap companies, I think the same principles apply. And the midcaps, which tend to have less-diversified portfolios, have to have that type of thinking applied to them even more stringently.Image provided by Shutterstock.

891,CELG,"Biotech stocks fell into one of the deepest craters in their history, starting last summer, but rumblings of a recovery are sounding.After a three-year bull run that more than quadrupled its value by its peak last July, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Industry Group plunged 50% by early February, hurt by backlashes against high drug prices and mergers that seek to lower corporate taxes.But the group has gained 12% since its Feb. 11 low, and some leading stocks have done better than that.3 Biotech Stocks Buoyed By Potential Blockbuster DrugsBioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) is up 30% from its Feb. 9 low. Incyte (INCY) has gained 29% from its low point that same week, while Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) has climbed 45%, and Medivation (MDVN), boosted by buyout talk, is up 127%.The group was up by even more before taking some hits over the past two weeks on negative earnings news from several industry players. But fund managers tell IBD the rebound is here.Why? For one, they say, the spate of bad news has already been factored into stock prices. But more than that, they see a climate favoring rejuvenated M&A, hot drugs in the new-product pipeline and pricing power for innovate products.Bottom line: The positive factors that drove the runup never went away, they say. They just got drowned out by the noise.""A very key point is that this group is a very high-beta group -- particularly the small- to midcap stocks. Since they don't have sales, they don't have earnings,"" said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management.""The history of this group is that elevated macro uncertainty definitely hits (it),"" Vandeventer said. ""My own opinion is this group trades more on sentiment than on fundamentals during those time periods.""Vandeventer points to troubles in China as emblematic of the macroeconomic concerns that hit biotech stocks.Another sentiment-driving factor is politics.Many of the candidates in the U.S. presidential race have bashed drugmakers for high prices and have proposed ways to clamp down. Wall Street has dismissed some of these ideas as impossible or ineffective. What seems to be generating the most concern are Democrats' proposals to let Medicare and Medicaid negotiate drug prices, which they are not allowed to do now.Already the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services has shown its teeth. It announced a pilot program changing the reimbursement for Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in hospitals and clinics. The Part B reimbursement scheme was long criticized for encouraging use of expensive drugs because it reimburses health care providers for the entire cost of a drug, plus 6% on top. The proposed scheme would reduce that premium and add a flat fee unrelated to the price of the drug. That, in theory, could encourage doctors to choose cheaper options.On the M&A front, the Treasury Department last month issued new guidelines on tax-inversion deals that derailed what would have been the drug industry's biggest-ever merger, between Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN). Tax inversions have become a popular way for drugmakers to boost their bottom lines and get access to cash. Allergan, after earlier mergers, is based in Ireland, which has low taxes.""We think that with the tax regulation -- I call this the 'inversion bottom' -- and the bad press associated with the health care industry, that created a bottom in our minds,"" said Robert Bombace, senior portfolio manager at Frost Investment Advisors. ""A lot of the bad news has already been baked into these companies.""In fact, a number of industry insiders say the breakup of the Pfizer-Allergan merger could turn out to be good for biotech stocks because it makes them acquisition targets for the two companies. Allergan has a long history of acquisitiveness, and Pfizer is thinking of splitting its innovative drug business from its other products. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum says Pfizer will want to bulk up its innovative business to make it valuable as a standalone, since its pipeline is modest compared to its big-pharma competitors.Schoenebaum has also said, though, that biotech boards are balking at buyout offers. They can't accept how much their valuations have dropped, so they've been unwilling to sell at market prices. He suspects this will lead to hostile takeover deals if the big players are willing to do them. This partly came to fruition in late April, when Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid for Medivation, as rumors swirled that AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer were also interested.Medivation's response reflected the attitude that Schoenebaum spoke of -- that the market was underpricing the stock.""Sanofi's opportunistically timed proposal, which comes during a period of significant market dislocation, and before several important near-term events for the company, is designed to seize for Sanofi value that rightly belongs to our stockholders,"" Medivation founder and CEO David Hung said in a statement rejecting the offer.Bombace, however, says the biotechs' reluctance might be for show.""I think that's just a bargaining chip,"" he said. ""The reality is that most of these companies will have to partner up anyway. ... The larger pharma and biotech names ... will reach a point where their pipelines are so dry, it will force their hands.""Bombace sees lots of exciting biotechnology science going on to fill out those pipelines. As he put it, we're ""going from the Model T stage to the space-shuttle stage.""Though he declined to name specific companies, he pointed to work in biomarkers -- which include PD-1 inhibitors such as Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda. He also cited work in genetic mutations, the focus of many rare-disease firms such as BioMarin and Bluebird Bio (BLUE).These discoveries are keeping money flowing into and out of biotechnology, says Leonard Yaffe, who manages a health care hedge fund at Kessef Capital Management. He told IBD that specialty drugs -- the largely biologic drugs prescribed by specialists, as opposed to primary-care doctors -- contributed only 1% of prescriptions last year but 37% of dollars spent on drugs, up from 25% two years earlier.""One thing I think will drive the biotech stocks is that, if you look at drugs introduced in the last two years, 65% of the revenue derived from those drugs are from biologicals,"" Yaffe said. ""So it's the most attractive sector in the pharmaceutical area.""Also, while most publicly traded biotech stocks don't have earnings, those that have successfully launched drugs remain highly profitable. Of the top five biotechs in market cap -- Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) -- four have IBD EPS Ranks ranging from 89 to 96, putting them in the top 11% of all stocks in EPS growth. Regeneron has a 68 EPS Rank.Those numbers, however, reflect the pricing power of biologic drugs, which is precisely what's under political attack these days. Vandeventer says price uncertainty is the biggest risk to his bull thesis on the group right now. But he also points out that Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton attempted a previous overhaul of the health care system back in the mid-1990s, which depressed drug stocks in the short term but was followed by the late-1990s boom.That boom was driven by the first wave of biotech innovation, when companies like Amgen and Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech proved that biotechnology could produce blockbusters. Vandeventer says that innovation will remain the key in maintaining pricing power, even under political pressure. He points to Gilead's portfolio of hepatitis C drugs, which started in late 2013 with the launch of Sovaldi. Despite much political criticism of Sovaldi's high price, no one could stop it because the drug was so superior to anything else on the market.""Companies that have done the research -- they'll continue to get price increases,"" he said. ""Companies that are particularly in the rare-disease, orphan-disease arena, (or) the oncology space -- companies that have drugs in an era of targeted medicine that have higher efficacy rather than a shotgun trying to hit a disease -- are going to have pricing power.""The promise of such drugs can still make small stocks explode. Celator Pharmaceuticals (CPXX) has surged to over 13 from under 3 since March on favorable late-stage trial results for its acute myeloid leukemia treatment. The company also saw a hedge fund take a position in the stock and attracted favorable initial coverage from an analyst.There are signs that even generalist investors think biotech stocks have gotten cheap, says Yaffe. During the first quarter, a common lament was that every biotech stock got punished for bad news, but good news got no reward. But when Biogen issued a mixed earnings report that drew mostly negative reactions from Wall Street on April 21, its stock rose more than 5%.Biogen had fallen even harder than other big-cap biotechs, dropping 50% from its March 2015 high to its Feb. 12 low, so it was ready for a bounce, says Yaffe.""The overview comment is the sector had corrected 30%, and at some point it gets to the level where the stocks are very attractive,"" he said.

892,CELG,"The new IBD Tech Leaders Index looks at companies in the technology field that are highly rated using IBD’s proprietary ratings. With the current market condition being Uptrend Under Pressure, these names should be approached with higher caution, especially since they will be tied more to the performance of the Nasdaq composite.As of the April 29 list, the electronics sector stands out with a dominant representation by two industry groups making up more than 25% of the list: the scientific measurement electronics group, at No. 10 of IBD's 197 industry groups, and the electronics parts manufacturers, at No. 23.Many of the stocks in the sector serve in support roles, so part of your analysis should include the areas of exposure for the companies. Are they focused on life sciences with exposure to the biotech industry? Biotechs had a great run in 2014, but the group has fallen considerably, with big winners like Celgene (CELG) and Gilead (GILD) topping in the summer of 2015.A company like Danaher (DHR) has exposure to multiple industries, with segments that serve life sciences and diagnostics vs. its segments focused on industrial technologies and petroleum businesses. Danaher will make the analysis a little easier when they complete a tax-free spinoff in the third quarter of 2016. The company retaining the Danaher name will keep the life science exposure and the new spinoff, named Fortive, will take the industrial side.What about the exposure to foreign markets? Bruker (BRKR) not only has strong links to the life sciences and pharmaceutical research but also, according to the company website, 80% of its revenue comes from outside the U.S. As the first-quarter earnings season has unfolded, companies have often pointed to currency headwinds created by a strong dollar as being the culprit behind soft earnings.

The small cap Russell 2000 added 0.7%. Volume in the stock market today was running 2% higher on the Nasdaq and 7% lower on the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday.Blue chips in the Dow were mostly up, though volume was sluggish. In the S&P 500, biotech Celgene (CELG) was the biggest percentage gainer, up about 6% in volume, 20% faster than usual.Among small caps, LGI Homes (LGIH) rumbled 11% higher in heavy volume. The low-end homebuilder reported that Q1 home closings rose about 26% on a year-over-year basis.When Texas-based LGI launched its IPO in November 2013, the company had a market presence in Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Florida. As of early December, the company had expanded its reach to North Carolina, South Carolina, Colorado, New Mexico and Washington state.Earnings per share jumped 83% last year on a 64% revenue gain. The Street expects EPS to rise 34% this year on a 29% pop in revenue.The Federal Reserve released its minutes from its March meeting. The minutes showed that the Fed appears reluctant to raise rates in April, though some members refused to rule out an April rate hike.

894,CELG,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) was already a diversified biotech before this year but now it can make a new claim to technology that's based on the altered genetics -- of ratsIt may seem distasteful and not very profitable, but it proved to be a turning point when in January the early-stage biotech company acquired OMT, the firm that developed the technology.OMT, which stands for Open Monoclonal Technology, was using rodent DNA to discover human antibodies for therapeutic use. The move gives Ligand another ""avenue of growth"" as it ventures forth into one of the hottest areas of medicine, says Larry Solow, an analyst at CJS Securities.""You can also use animal antibodies to develop drugs for humans using these models,"" Solow told Investor's Business Daily. ""A rat model can lead to a human drug.""Some of the top-selling drugs -- Humira, Remicade, MabThera/Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin -- used human antibodies in their development.OMT is believed to be the only company in the world to offer three transgenic animal platforms, known by the names OmniRat, OmniMouse and OmniFlic.Since Ligand acquired OMT, three drug companies have licensed the technology: Emergent BioSolutions (EBS), Tizona Therapeutics and ABBA Therapeutics, a Swiss biotech.Those came on top of the 16 licensees that OMT had previously lined up, including biopharma giants Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE) and Celgene (CELG), to name a few.Unlike typical licensing partnerships, which provide royalties and milestone payments, OMT's partners have been paying for access to its technology. But they eventually could pay milestone payments and royalties, too.Ligand had expected OMT to add $6 million in revenue this year and $12 million next year, for a total of $113 million-$117 million in 2016 and more than $158 million in 2017.  But that was before the addition of Emergent, Tizona and ABBA to its client list from the deal. Ligand will likely update guidance in its next earnings report, set for May 4.The $178 million OMT deal and positive news on other Ligand-licensed drugs haven’t diminished investor sentiment. Shares have risen roughly 12% this year.In early April, the European Commission approved expanded use of the European version of one of Ligand's two top licensed drugs, Promacta, for use in pediatric patients with a rare blood disorder. The drug is sold by partner Novartis (NVS).In mid-March, licensee Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (SPPI) won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for Evomela, for use in treating certain cases of multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer. The drug earns Ligand higher-than-normal royalties of 20%.Positive clinical data this year and beyond on other Ligand-licensed drugs also bodes well for future revenue growth, analysts say.""We anticipate that current revenue streams from partnered products and the broad 'in development' portfolio are poised to drive significant growth in the near and longer term,"" wrote analyst Joseph Pantginis in a recent research note for Roth Capital Partners.In addition to royalties, Ligand already generates significant revenue from a proprietary formulation technology called Captisol, a sugar molecule that helps absorb drugs into the body, especially helpful in those with harmful side effects.But Captisol and other material sales can vary from quarter to quarter depending on when they are needed for clinical trials and commercial use. In the fourth quarter, lower material sales -- $7.2 million vs. $13 million a year earlier -- caused overall revenue to decline to $21.2 million from last year's $23 million.Still, revenue for the full year rose 11% on top of 32% growth in 2014. And royalty revenue in 2015 rose more than 27% to $38.2 million.Lumpy material sales and any related quarterly declines ""do not concern us,"" Solow said.He expects royalty revenue to grow 50% this year and 40% in 2017. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see total revenue rising 65% this year to $119 million and going up 37% next year.Earnings in Q4 rose 10% from the prior year to 66 cents a share. Analysts expect flat EPS growth this year and then a 51% increase next year, to $5.10 a share.Nearly half of Ligand’s drug partnerships are based on Captisol technology, Solow says, including one of its top-two sellers, Kyprolis, used to treat multiple myeloma.Both Kyprolis and Promacta, an oral drug that boosts platelets in the blood, generated sales of more than $500 million last year, Solow says.He figures that Ligand last year received around 6.5% in royalties on Promacta sales vs. Kyprolis’ roughly 2%. Promacta is sold by Novartis, Krypolis by Amgen (AMGN).“Kyprolis could ultimately have bigger commercial potential, but royalties are higher from Promacta, so it’s the more important of the two drugs,” Solow said.Ligand has dozens of other early-stage drugs it has found partners to take to the next stage. They target a multitude of diseases, such as hepatitis, diabetes, cancer, anemia, Alzheimer’s and kidney disease, among others.Ligand has more than 140 partnered programs with over 70 different companies.Ligand essentially passes off the heavy lifting needed to bring drugs to market, enjoying royalties and milestones with relatively little investment costs.Ligand’s cash operating expenses last year totaled around $25 million while their partners spent over $1.1 billion in research and development, says Solow.“It shows the power of their business model,” he said, noting that the company's overhead is relatively low. “If R&D yields commercial drugs, they will get 4% to 5% in royalties.”In 2016, Ligand’s partners are expected to spend close to $2 billion in R&D, he adds, with about half of the growth coming from OMT.With more than 140 “shots on goal” – or partnered programs – Ligand has “numerous avenues” of growth, wrote analyst Drew Jones of Stephens in an initiation report in mid-April. He rated the stock overweight.Jones expects Promacta and Kyprolis to generate more than $200 million in royalties for Ligand over the next few years compared to $38.2 million in 2015. In addition, he estimates that several of the company’s next-biggest programs could provide $750 million in potential royalties as they move into commercialization.“We expect Ligand’s management team to continue its shrewd capital deployment strategy via technology focused acquisitions,” he noted.

895,CELG,"Biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ (REGN) core ophthalmology business still has huge upside as its Eylea sales grow in treating a variety of eye diseases, says RBC Capital. RBC also says that a legal settlement with Amgen (AMGN) over Praluent, a drug intended to lower bad LDL cholesterol, would be a positive.Most of Regeneron’s sales come from Eylea, launched in 2011 to treat age-related vision loss in the elderly. Regeneron aims to build sales of Eylea in the market for treating diabetic macular edema (DME), a cause of blindness in working-age people, as well as a related eye disease affecting older people.“Turning DME into a $2 billion to $3 billion market opportunity is important and likely,” Adnan Butt, an RBC Capital analyst, said in a research report Tuesday. In DME, Eylea competes with Roche Holding’s (RHHBY) Lucentis.Regeneron typically reports earnings in early May. Roche, Novartis (NVS) and Bayer (BAYRY) report earnings on April 19, 21 and 26, respectively, and their commentary could provide insights into Eylea’s growth, says RBC’s Butt.He says that consensus expectations for the recently launched cholesterol drug Praluent, which had only $7 million in December-quarter sales, still need to come down. Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha. In March, a federal jury upheld the validity of two Amgen patents related to the cholesterol drug, dealing a blow to Regeneron and partner Sanofi (SNY).“A settlement with Amgen could be a positive,” Butt said in the report. He rates Regeneron stock outperform, with a price target of 668. Regeneron stock was up more than 1.5% in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 402.50.Amgen reports earnings on April 28, followed by Sanofi on April 29. Their earnings calls could provide reads on the status of Praluent litigation, says Butt.Regeneron stock has plunged 26% in 2016 amid a broad sell-off in biotech stocks, including Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).Regeneron shares touched a six-month low below 349 last month but jumped on April 1 after the company announced strong phase three clinical results for dupilumab, a drug for eczema, an itchy skin condition. Regeneron is developing that drug with Sanofi.“The landmark deal with Sanofi provides $160 million per year to fund antibody discovery for eight years, gives Regeneron 50% of the profit and defers all development costs until the partnership is profitable,” added Butts.Startup Intellia Therapeutics late Monday announced a licensing deal with Regeneron. Cambridge, Mass.-based Intellia has developed “gene editing” technology to treat liver and blood diseases. It plans to go public.Regeneron has an IBD composite rating of 58 out of a possible 99, lower than both Celgene and Gilead. IBD’s Medical-Biomed/Biotech group ranks just No. 108 out of 197 industry groups. That’s down from No. 39 six months ago.  But it's up 9.8% the past four weeks, 10th best in that span.Anika Therapeutics (ANIK), Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) have the highest IBD Composite Ratings within the biotech group.

896,CELG,"New Year predictions last almost as long as New Year's resolutions. A year ago, the Federal Reserve was forecasting four rate hikes in 2016 and Hillary Clinton was the favorite to win the presidency.The unknowns for 2017 start with the tone set by Washington. Will investors see ""good Trump"" or ""bad Trump""? Will Republicans repeal and replace ObamaCare?On the economic front, will OPEC and allies carry out oil production cuts — and how fast will U.S. shale companies boost output? Tesla (TSLA) is supposed to begin deliveries of its Model 3, but the roads are getting crowded with electric vehicles. Apple (AAPL) hopes the iPhone 8 will wow consumers and revive sales. Snapchat is set to go public; will Uber and other big unicorns follow?This new year may be as unpredictable as any, but here are 10 key issues and challenges to watch that will affect your investments and the economy.Investor's Business Daily's Ed Carson, Jed Graham, Allison Gatlin, Elaine Low, Gillian Rich, Patrick Seitz, Brian Deagon and Bill Peters contributed to this article.Donald Trump promises an ambitious agenda: a 15% corporate tax rate; repealing ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank and other regulations; and a $1 trillion infrastructure program. The U.S. economy has been stuck in second gear for years, with businesses reluctant to invest. The prospect of a Trump administration already has revived ""animal spirits,"" and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index and other business surveys show soaring confidence.But the populist president-elect has a zeal for conducting ad hoc industrial policy in public. He's used Twitter and TV to target United Technologies (UTX), Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as well as drug prices.And his protectionist instincts could have serious consequences, given a president's broad authority on trade. Trump could adopt a few anti-dumping duties on China, expanding on actions by Presidents Bush and Obama. Or he could withdraw from Nafta or trigger a full-blown trade war with China that roils the global economy.So far investors are betting that Trump's pro-growth, low-tax agenda will carry the day. Stocks have rallied strongly since Election Day. But some sectors — banks, steel, mining — have fared better than others.Before the election, the Federal Reserve worried that slow growth had become a chronic condition for the U.S. economy. In 2017 the Fed will shift to the role of traffic cop, trying to keep the economy from blowing past its speed limit.If Trump's fiscal fuel sparks inflationary pressures, the Fed could raise rates by more than the three quarter-point hikes that the central bank is predicting. But a positive scenario could play out if Trump's policies boost productivity, essentially raising the speed limit so the economy can drive faster without an upsurge in inflation.The Fed will likely follow financial markets' lead. In recent years, the Fed has spoken loudly but carried a Wiffle bat. Policymakers' goal of four rate hikes in 2016 was whittled down to one quarter-point move at year-end, in large part due to concerns about global markets.The Fed in 2017 will include two new Trump appointments to fill vacancies. Trump's appointees may be especially open to the idea that his deregulation and corporate tax cuts can help revive productivity growth and increase labor-force participation. And by year-end Trump likely will nominate his choice for Fed chief; Janet Yellen's term ends in February 2018.RELATED:In 2017, Fed Will Play Traffic Cop As Trump Hits Fiscal AcceleratorRepublicans appear intent on kicking off 2017 with a vote to repeal ObamaCare but may delay actually replacing the system for years.The health exchanges have been struggling, with younger and healthier people declining to sign up, even with the individual mandate. Republicans can get rid of the law's sweeping tax and spending provisions. But with only 52 votes in the Senate, GOP leaders couldn't overturn coverage mandates without at least some Democratic support.Republicans could repeal ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, perhaps via block grants that would give states much more flexibility over federal funds.Yet many health policy experts and industry players have warned that a repeal without replacement could blow up the individual insurance market operating under ObamaCare rules. Many health insurers such as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET) are already pulling out of most exchanges, tired of suffering losses.They and their peers may throw in the towel entirely if the law is largely repealed without a long-term replacement. If wide swathes of the country lack an individual market insurer for 2018, what will the government do?RELATED:Trump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?' ObamaCare MomentAfter a rough 2016 with drug prices under the campaign spotlight, a slew of potential FDA approvals and big trial data, particularly in the cancer arena, could catalyze biotech stocks.The FDA is slated to examine PARP inhibitors from Tesaro (TSRO) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) to treat ovarian cancer. The duo will compete in a multibillion-dollar market with already-approved Lynparza from AstraZeneca (AZN). Celgene (CELG) has a multiple myeloma drug under FDA priority review. The FDA will also look at Ariad Pharmaceuticals' (ARIA) brigatinib, which fights non-small-cell lung cancer.Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to seek approval for its refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma drug, an early CAR-T treatment. Seattle Genetics (SGEN) aims to change traditional Hodgkin lymphoma therapy when it unveils phase-three data.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Biogen (BIIB) each have data on Alzheimer's treatments due in 2017. Drugs that significantly slow cognitive decline would be huge blockbusters.Some biomed companies may make announcements about drugs or financials at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January.RELATED:Which Top 5 Biotech Stocks In 2016 Are Slated For Triple-Digit Gains?Seattle Genetics CEO Angles For Hodgkin's Lymphoma EurekaOil stocks have rallied since crude prices bottomed in early 2016, and the industry has reason for cautious optimism. After a two-year effort to drive out U.S. shale producers largely failed, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries — along with top non-OPEC producers — agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day starting in January to prop up oil prices. But cartel members have a history of breaking production quotas.Russia already has said that it will only gradually lower production, and analysts expect Iraq to be the first OPEC member to cheat on its output target. Even if OPEC's plan fails, the International Energy Agency sees oil markets balancing in the second half of 2017, helped by rising demand.But will crude prices, which more than doubled from early 2016 lows, continue to climb? That may depend on how quickly U.S. shale production revives. U.S. crude output started to climb as the number of oil rigs in use rose sharply in recent weeks and months. Many shale players have cut their costs and can profit at lower oil price levels.Trump's pick for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson, is another bullish sign for U.S. oil companies headed into 2017, given Tillerson's experience with international energy trade deals.A lot rides on Apple's 11th-generation smartphone due out in the fall. Unofficially called the iPhone 8, the 10th anniversary model could sport a radical redesign, with a glass sandwich look, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and wireless charging.Bullish analysts believe the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones. IPhone shipments fell 8% in Apple's fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market.Many analysts see Apple returning to smartphone sales growth next year, thanks to the iPhone 8. Apple's fast-growing services business — which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and more — is another expected bright spot for 2017.Others are more pessimistic. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz has predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Initial public offerings are expected to rebound in 2017 from a seven-year low. Among the first high-profile new stocks is likely to be Snapchat owner Snap, one of the widely watched tech ""unicorns"" valued above $1 billion. Snap's IPO, expected in the first quarter, could raise $4 billion and value the company at $25 billion.Snapchat is growing rapidly, but the parent company has struggled to turn a profit. And it faces competition from Facebook (FB), whose photo-sharing Instagram site is adopting Snapchat-like features.Other unicorns expected to go public in 2017 are music service provider Spotify, software maker AppDynamics and data analytics company Palantir. Uber, valued at $68 billion, is not expected to IPO in 2017. Neither is Airbnb.Renaissance Capital believes activity will pick up significantly in 2017, ""breaking the long IPO recession"" that started in August 2015.In 2016, 105 IPOs raised $18.8 billion. Both the number and dollar value fell 38% from 2015. The top-performing IPO of 2016 was optical components supplier Acacia Communications (ACIA), which is up 168.5% from its May IPO price of 23. But it has lost more than half its value since early September, ending the year at a five-month low.The overall stock market trend will be critical to IPO activity and success. If the postelection rally continues, more companies will go public and will likely fare well. But if the stock indexes move sideways or correct, unicorns will be rare.RELATED:IPO Outlook For 2017: Amid Mixed Predictions, Focus On The Chart ActionThe electric-car race will intensify when Tesla Motors introduces its long-awaited Model 3 in the second half of 2017. It will be Tesla's most affordable car, with a base-model cost of about $35,000, far less than the more-upscale Model S sedan and Model X crossover SUV.Tesla is on track to deliver about 80,000 vehicles in 2016 and aims to ramp up auto production to 500,000 deliveries a year by 2018.Tesla has a history of missing deadlines and cutting production targets, though CEO Elon Musk will strive to get at least some Model 3 vehicles out the door next year. Musk also will be busy integrating recently acquired SolarCity as well as completing Tesla's battery Gigafactory.Meanwhile, General Motors (GM), Ford (F), Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) are selling or planning to introduce all-electric vehicles that target many of the same potential buyers as the Model 3. Like the Model 3, they will have self-driving features.Tesla also faces threats from tech giants such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Alphabet has spun out its self-driving car efforts into its own unit, Waymo. But the Google parent has backed off plans to create vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals in favor of partnerships with existing carmakers.Apple, which has never acknowledged its Project Titan efforts, reportedly has shifted from making a self-driving electric car to developing operating systems for autonomous vehicles.Mobileye (MBLY) and Delphi (DLPH) will showcase their turnkey autonomous-driving technology at CES 2017 in early January.It's still unclear if electric cars are ready for mass adoption. They are more expensive than gas-powered vehicles — and federal tax credits will soon expire for new Tesla buyers. And charging takes far longer than filling up the tank.Fears of cord-cutting — pay-TV subscribers canceling their cable packages — continue to abound in the media space. But a recent PwC survey, which found that 76% of respondents were pay-TV subscribers in 2016 vs. 79% the year before, suggests that ""cord-cutting may continue at a much slower rate than predicted.""Still, subscriber losses at ESPN, owned by Walt Disney (DIS), raise concerns about the power of live sports programming to discourage viewers from dumping their all-inclusive cable packages.Hulu — owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal and Time Warner (TWX) — plans to roll out a live-streaming service in the new year that will include broadcast and cable networks. Google's YouTube is also said to be working on a streaming TV service that could go live in 2017.The two players would join a crop of over-the-top TV competitors including Sling TV (Dish Network (DISH)), PlayStation Vue (Sony (SNE)) and DirecTV Now (AT&T (T)).After a long slog through years of low rates, weak economic growth and post-crisis regulation, banks appear set for a better 2017. Trump's transition team has said the incoming president will ""dismantle"" Dodd-Frank. His tax-and-spending programs could boost demand but also lift inflation, triggering more Federal Reserve rate hikes. Wider yield spreads should expand banks' net interest margins.All this sent bank stocks soaring along with Treasury yields in late 2016, especially after the presidential election. Bank of America (BAC) is seen as the most U.S.-exposed of the big banks, meaning it is most likely to benefit from any rate hikes from the Fed and faster U.S. economic growth.Meanwhile, Citigroup (C) still has significant international operations that could be hurt if Trump sets U.S. trade deals ablaze.Dozens of smaller banks have hit multiyear highs. Bank investors are pricing in aggressive Fed and Trump moves in 2017 with bond yields continuing to climb. But if those actions do not occur, bank earnings and stocks may disappoint.RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

897,CELG,"U.S. stock indexes booked solid gains Wednesday afternoon, but biomed stocks dived on President-elect Donald Trump's vow to bring down drug prices.The Nasdaq advanced 0.7%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1% and 1.4%, respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Medical stocks struggled after Trump said in a Time Magazine interview that he doesn't like ""what's happened with drug prices"" and would bring down prices. Trump made no mention of investment in research and development, which is never free. Companies such as Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) put 40% of revenue into research and development, while Big Cap 20 stock Incyte (INCY) put 63% of revenue into R&D last year. Without strong growth in revenue and profits, R&D budgets would shrink, and the odds of developing new drugs would also fade.High-end biomeds, which rely the most on R&D, led the retreat Wednesday with the group down about 4%.Meanwhile, for the rest of the market it was business as usual.Bank stocks, which have led the Trump rally, were little changed. The exchange-traded fund PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) inched up 0.7% to 47.05. The bank ETF has gained about 21% since its Election Day close.Steel has been another area of strength in the stock market and that continued Wednesday afternoon. Gainers among steel producers included United States Steel (X), up 5.4%; AK Steel (AKS), up 3.7%; and Nucor (NUE), up 1.7%. Steel alloy stocks also showed strength. Carpenter Technology (CRS) popped 4.5% as it retook its 50-day line. Allegheny Technologies (ATI) rose 1% as it tried to clear a base.In economic news, the Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey was little changed in October. Layoffs slipped, but so did the rate of hiring. The job openings gauge is one that Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen watches closely. CME Group's FedWatch Tool was unchanged Wednesday with a 94.9% chance of an interest rate hike in December.RELATED:Trump Targets Drug Prices, Apple, Seeks '5 Minutes' With Offshoring Firms10 Chip Stocks Get Buy RatingsSouthwest Air, Delta Break Out Of Bases

900,CELG,"Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stock rocketed to a 12-month high Thursday and No. 3 biotech Celgene (CELG) is seeing life post-Revlimid patent cliff on a new method of blasting multiple myeloma that could rival Juno Therapies (JUNO), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Amgen (AMGN).In the stock market today, Bluebird Bio stock jumped 14% to 68.65, earlier touching a one-year high of 76.75 despite a tough day for drug and tech stocks overall. Shares of partner Celgene rose a fraction to 118.87. Bluebird and Celgene are developing bbb2121, which targets the BCMA protein found in cancerous plasma cells.The treatment could be a boon for Celgene, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young says. Celgene's patent on Revlimid is set to expire in mid-2027. Revlimid is an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) used to treat multiple myeloma.She models $900 million in Revlimid sales in 2026, when Celgene is poised to allow Natco to sell a generic rival, 18 months ahead of the patent expiry. Celgene's bull case depends on maintaining its hematology/myeloma franchise post-Revlimid, she says.Young has an outperform rating and 145 price target on Celgene stock.IBD'S TAKE: Are you getting the most out of your investments? If not, check out Investor's Corner for tips on how to manage your portfolio.Bbb2121 is interesting, Young says. It's a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy. CAR T-cell therapy engineers patients immune cells to treat cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute. CARs are proteins that allow T cells to recognize a specific antigen on tumor cells.Grown in a lab, CAR T-cells are later infused into a patient by the billions. After the infusion, the T cells multiply within the patient's body and ""with guidance from their engineered receptor, recognize and kill cancer cells that harbor the antigen on their surfaces,"" the NCI explains.Celgene and Bluebird aren't alone in their CAR T-cell efforts. Juno stock tanked 24.5% on Nov. 23 when it announced that two patients died during a CAR T-cell trial, prompting the firm to place the trial on clinical hold.Kite is partnered with Amgen to develop CAR T-cell therapies based on Kite's (aACT) engineered autologous cell therapy and Amgen's slate of cancer targets. Kite stock fell 1.5% on Nov. 23 on rival Juno's trial woes.Shares of both Juno and Kite fell a fraction Thursday. IBD's 421-company Biotech industry group fell 1.9%, below its 200-day line.RBC analyst Michael Yee calls CAR T-cell therapies ""the most potent approach to hit myeloma hardest and efficacy is key in refractory myeloma."" He has an outperform rating and 135 price target on Celgene stock following Bluebird's phase 1 study announcement late Wednesday.In a nine-patient phase 1 study of patients who failed an average six rounds of treatment for blood cancer, bbb2121 showed a 100% overall response rate (ORR) at mid- and high-doses. Two patients on the highest dose — 450 million cells — showed a complete response.The key to bbb2121, Yee notes, is high efficacy and no side effects.RELATEDBluebird Bio, Celgene Multiple Myeloma Therapy Strong In 9-Patient StudyAmgen, Biogen, Celgene Eye M&A In Trump's 'Pro-Biotech' WorldCelgene, Kite, Spark Look To Sidestep Lilly Alzheimer's Flop

Shares of Bluebird Bio shares skyrocketed Thursday morning, while larger partner Celgene (CELG) also rose.The phase 1 study had just nine patients, who had failed an average six rounds of other treatments for the blood cancer. Among the three patients getting the lowest dose — 50 million cells — one showed a 50% reduction in signs of cancer. Meanwhile all three patients getting a medium dose — 150 million cells — and all three getting the largest dose — 450 million cells — showed at least a 50% cut, with two showing virtually no cancer in their system.""We are pleased that these early data from our ongoing Phase 1 study of bb2121 demonstrate objective anti-tumor responses in heavily pre-treated patients with multiple myeloma, with all patients in the 15.0 x 107 and 45.0 x 107 CAR+ T cell dose cohorts achieving responses, including among them, patients with stringent complete responses and elimination of minimal residual disease,"" said David Davidson, M.D., chief medical officer for Bluebird Bio in a statement.The treatment is called bb2121, going after the BCMA protein found in cancerous plasma cells.Bluebird Bio shares shot up 25.3% to 75.61 shortly after the opening bell on the stock market today, the highest since Dec. 4, 2015. Bluebird closed Wednesday down 6.3% at 60.35.Celgene rose 0.7% intraday.Bluebird's bbb2121 is one of numerous promising as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapies. In addition to the positive benefits, the lack of major side effects is huge.Earlier this month, Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) halted a CAR T cancer drug trial after two patients died, sending shares crashing 24.5% on Nov. 23.Kite Pharma (KITE), another CAR T player, reported bullish results for its aggressive Non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment in late September. Kite has an alliance with biotech giant Amgen (AMGN).Kite edged higher intraday while Juno fell a fraction.Bluebird, Kite and Juno are suffering deep losses and not much revenue, which is not unusual for small biotechs without an approved treatment.

IBB debuted on IBD Leaderboard March 9, making it the first ETF to be added as a short-sale idea. Shorting the ETF would allow investors to profit if its holdings continue to decline.The $6.04 billion exchange traded fund's downward-sloping relative strength line reflects the weakness found in the charts of most major biotechs. Investors can also use ProShares UltraShort Nasdaq Biotech (BIS) to achieve the same goal. It's an ETF leader in the current market with a Relative Strength Rating of 98. That means its recent price performance is in the top two percentile of all stocks and ETFs tracked by IBD.BIS seeks daily investment results that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index.An ETF investor might legitimately ask: Is it better to short the largest biotech ETF or to take a long position in its inverse counterpart?The inverse ETF is probably best left alone by all except sophisticated ETF investors and day traders.""If an investor is looking for dollar-for-dollar gain for falling ETF price, then it would be appropriate to short the specific ETF,"" Monish Shah, head of ETF trading at Mizuho Securities, recently told IBD. ""For instance, if you short 1,000 shares of a particular ETF and then the price drops by $1, your unrealized profit would be $1,000. However, the major risk of short selling is that while the profit is capped, risk is unlimited. Because in a short position, the ETF price could rise indefinitely, and this would force the investor to cover at a higher price.""With an inverse ETF, the loss is capped, i.e. the amount you have invested. But inverse ETFs may bring risks or challenges for the average investor.""It is critical to understand that an inverse return on the underlying index is expected to match only on a daily basis,"" Shah added, ""but over a longer term, a significant disconnect will likely arise between the return on an inverse ETF and the return on its underlying index due to the compounding effect.""Both types of investing strategies have the potential to amp up your portfolio returns in a restrained investing climate. However, they require more molly-coddling to ensure any losses don't run away from you. That will be key to successful investing.How's the overall picture for IBB and other biotech ETFs?The major holdings of IBB include Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD).""While those stocks are in deep corrections, the industry fundamentals aren't so bad,"" according to the IBD markets team. ""The heath care sector has the best EPS and sales growth estimates for 2016, and analyst revisions in biotech are the best for any part of the sector. Drug pipelines remain well-stocked. Plus, licensing deals remain hot. But no question, sales growth has slowed sharply from a 2014 peak.""IBB was falling 3% on the stock market today, while BIS added 6% intraday.Year to date, IBB plunged 23% through March 14.

Another big deal was the $7.2 billion that Celgene (CELG) this month announced it would pay to acquire Receptos (RCPT). Receptos came public in May 2013.

957,CELG,"Drug stocks fell Wednesday as Wall Street sorted through the impact of proposed changes to Medicare Part B reimbursement designed to drive down the prices of some expensive hospital drugs.Late Tuesday, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed a pilot program testing a new reimbursement scheme for Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in hospitals or doctors' offices. Currently, CMS will pay back the price of the drug plus 6% for the health care provider, which critics say encourages doctors to prescribe more expensive drugs. Under the proposed rule, doctors would get just a 2.5% premium plus a flat fee of $16.80 per drug per day, which would somewhat reduce the disparity between different-priced drugs.CMS also proposed reducing or eliminating the portion that the patient has to pay for the drug, and tying the reimbursement level to the effectiveness of a drug for a given indication. Thus, if the same drug works well for one condition but only so-so for another, CMS would reimburse it at different levels for each condition.The agency also wants to create online ""decision support tools"" to help physicians determine the most effective drug to use in a given situation. Another test would let CMS enter voluntary risk-sharing agreements with drug makers linking price adjustments with patient outcomes.There will be a comment period on the CMS proposal until May 9. At that point, CMS plans to place providers into two different groups, one using the old reimbursement method and one the new one, and study the differences between the groups over the course of five years. It plans to start testing its other ideas starting January 2017.The reimbursement proposal drew the most attention from Wall Street. The covered drugs would be mostly infused or injected treatments for serious conditions, as opposed to pills that the patient can take on her or his own, and so, potentially affects some of the drug industry's biggest cash cows.""For the big biotechs, the most notable drugs that would fall under this theoretical test would be drugs that include Amgen (AMGN) (U.S. Neupogen, Neulasta ... also Kyprolis, Xgeva/Prolia, Vectibix, about 35%+ of total sales), Celgene (CELG) (U.S. Abraxane is 6% of revenue -- the other notable drugs are orals),"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan agreed about Amgen, adding that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Biogen (BIIB) also depend on drugs under the Medicare Part B umbrella.The new immunotherapy drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Merck (MRK), such as Opdivo, Keytruda and Yervoy, also are covered by Part B, but Yee argued that they aren't chosen for price reasons.""Consensus understands these drugs are chosen for high efficacy or where there aren't equivalent drugs that aren't also infused, not because of the 6% reimbursement,"" Yee wrote.Amgen stock hit a five-month low and ended the day down 2.6%, at 140.90. Regeneron tumbled 5.1% to 374.75. Celgene fell 1.1% and Biogen was off 2.2%. Bristol-Myers stock fell 1.1%, while Merck slipped a fraction.

958,CELG,"What's the hardest thing for a champion to do? Win again. And again. And again. Just ask repeat Super Bowl titlists, or baseball and horse racing's Triple Crown winners, or tennis Grand Slam champs. And it's just as hard for the best mutual funds too.The relatively few funds that are able to pull off the feat deserve recognition. And they deserve consideration as additions to or replacements in your retirement accounts, like 401(k)s and IRAs, as well as your taxable accounts.To help you identify those special mutual funds, IBD is introducing its Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards. Stock mutual funds qualify for this exclusive recognition only if they have beaten the broad market over the past one, three, five and 10 years -- all four of those periods, not just one or two or three.  Awards were earned in 12 mutual fund categories. The top five ranked by 10-year performance (the top six in the case of sector funds) are highlighted as the best of the best, deserving special recognition.Being a four-time winner was no easy task. Of 2,702 mutual funds that met the criteria of having at least $100 million in assets and 10 years of operation, only 308 beat their benchmark in each period. Of 1,091 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in business for the entire decade tracked by Morningstar Inc., only 101 pulled off the feat.Among 474 growth mutual funds, only 95 emerged as award winners.In some categories, it was much harder. Only three value mutual funds out of 292 beat their benchmark in all four time periods. Just four small-cap funds got awards.The winning stock mutual funds  -- including the categories of U.S. growth, blend and value, as well as large- mid- and small-cap -- were compared to the S&P 500 index in each of the four periods through Dec. 31, 2015.The international stock funds had to beat the MSCI EAFE index. The best U.S. taxable bond funds trumped the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index. Tax-exempt funds conquered the Barclays Municipal index. Foreign taxable bond funds outperformed the Barclays Global Aggregate.Click Here To View Table With The Top Funds By CategoryWhether you are looking for mutual funds to strengthen your current portfolio or just starting out, the IBD awards list is a great place to start. Here you'll find top-performing funds run by the smartest portfolio managers. The award winners are arrayed in categories of stock and bond funds that are most often used in building core positions in diversified portfolios -- from large-, mid- and small- cap to growth blend and value U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, equity sectors and bonds.Whether you're in the market for a large-cap growth or foreign bond fund, check out those categories' award winners. Is it available in your 401(k) plan? Get the funds' prospectuses and quarterly reports and manager commentaries to see which choices make the best fit in terms of your investment horizon and risk tolerance.Start with the top five, but take some time to consider all the award winners in the categories you're interested in. You might already be familiar with a fund company that has a fund among the top mutual funds. This can add confidence to your selection.If a fund you own is not one of the award winners, you won't want to rush out and dump it. It might be a perfectly good fund run by competent portfolio managers and fit a unique need of your portfolio. You might consider whether it outperformed its benchmark in most periods but narrowly missed in one or two.How, exactly, did these funds outperform so consistently? After all, to achieve award status a fund has shown its ability to survive market corrections and bear markets without racking up losses that ruin long-term returns.Several managers claim their secret involves an ability to ignore the short-term zigs and zags of the market.""An individual who expects short-term performance would not be the type of person to invest in our fund,"" says Keith Lee, a manager of $2.5 billion Brown Capital Management Small Company Fund (BCSIX), in explaining his team's preference for stocks that provide their fund with consistently superior growth over the long run -- and which have also outperformed over the past one year, despite aiming for strong long-term returns.But what it really means is an ability to put together a portfolio that's built to weather market storms. For many funds, that means a focus on companies that are not in highly cyclical businesses -- such as those involving commodities. For many, it also means sticking to businesses with strong balance sheets and little if any debt.And for many it means looking for sustainable earnings, not short-term flashes in the pan. Gavin Baker, manager of $11.7 billion Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX), has a similar view. “We have a long-term time horizon where we are looking out over five, 10 and 15 years, which I think is a big advantage,"" Baker told reporter Billy Fisher for a profile of Gavin's fund, which is also among the best of the U.S. stock mutual funds and large-cap stock mutual funds.Many award-winning managers take it a step further: Not only do they ignore what some of them call short-term ""noise"" in the market, they also stick to their own long-term game plans.Tim Parton, manager of $5.7 billion JPMorgan Growth Advantage (VHIAX), one of the top five funds in the large-cap category, helms a team that looks for leading stocks regardless of market capitalization.Working closely with colleagues who run small- and large-cap funds, Parton's team mixes those names with the midcap stocks he himself focuses on.""The other beauty of this strategy is that we're never forced to sell a good stock just because it gets too big, which is a perennial problem for small- and midcap managers,"" Parton said.In the past, his fund has had bigger weightings of small and midcap stocks when his team was finding more growth opportunities at attractive valuations among those market caps.And while Parton thinks long-term, his team does not ignore the here and now. ""In tough periods we focus on fundamentals of companies,"" he said. ""We make sure our names are not too affected by the environment they're in. We may trim size of positions to reduce risk.""And when a volatile market, like the one we've been experiencing, makes names his team likes even more attractively priced? Parton nibbles, but only very cautiously. ""Only on the margins,"" he said, explaining his caution toward stocks that have been knocked down in price for any reason. ""We already have a slightly higher-risk portfolio than a value fund manager.""Parton invests stock by stock. Still, sector weights show where he expects to find leaders. His biggest sector was information technology, with a 35.5% weighting as of Feb. 29, nearly double his second-largest sector, consumer discretionary.Tech holdings range from small caps like medical-software maker Veeva Systems (VEEV), to midcap database software maker Splunk (SPLK), large-cap gaming software maker Electronic Arts (EA) and giant-cap Microsoft (MSFT).Winning managers in many diversified U.S. stock fund categories make a point of thinking long-term and basing investment decisions on individual stocks much more than on hot sectors. Sector-fund managers plumb their respective ponds to fish for hot trends and land the dominant sharks in those waters.As IBD's Nancy Gondo explains in her diagnosis of top-performing sector funds, biotech and and health sciences have been clear outperformers over the past 10 years.Stocks like Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) pop up in recent portfolio disclosures of the top-ranked sector funds.Another trait shared by the best of the best: a focus on well-managed companies able to maintain pricing power even during the toughest times, reports Scott Stoddard in his examination of the best of the best international stock funds.Like sector funds, success among bond funds often hinges on the ability to play the hottest part of the fixed-income market -- and to avoid segments that are out of favor.As Marie Beerens reports in this special report, TCW Total Return Bond (TGLMX) was a 10-year outperformer thanks in large part to surfing the recovery in mortgages since the credit crisis.TCW manager Bryan Whalen told Beerens that his fund also avoided a headwind in 2015 by having ""almost no exposure to the corporate credit market,"" which dramatically lagged similar-duration Treasuries.So, are these best-of-the-best mutual funds all that you need in your portfolio? ""It's not a stand-alone fund,"" Parton said about his portfolio. ""This is a growth fund. It does not give you holistic exposure"" -- that is, exposure to all parts -- ""to the market. For that, it should be used with others.""And for those others, what better choices to consider than the IBD award winners, which have proven their mettle over the years, in various market segments, again and again.

959,CELG,"Cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA), coffee king Starbucks (SBUX),  “innovative” drug companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and a few biotechs make Morgan Stanley’s list of companies with pricing power.Amid a low-inflation environment and worries over a global recession, stocks with pricing power should get a serious look, says the Morgan Stanley report.Its list also includes American Tower (AMT), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Constellation Brands (STZ), Equinix (EQIX), L Brands (LB), Mindbody (MB), Phillip Morris (PM), Reynolds American (RAI), Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).Here’s Morgan Stanley’s take on why some of these companies have pricing power.1) American Tower. “Towers effectively offer local monopolies, and there is little alternative for wireless carriers wishing to add capacity to improve network quality.”2) Amgen. “While drug pricing has been a topic of debate since U.S. presidential candidates raised focus on the topic in the late summer of 2015, we continue to see pricing power among large cap biotech.”3) Biogen. “In 2015, management took around 11% to 12% gross price increases across its portfolio.”4) Celgene. “Management in 2015 took 7-10% gross price increases across its portfolio and we would expect a similar net price trend in 2016.”5) Comcast. “We are positive on CMCSA’s broadband growth story and see improved results in video given X1 (set-top box deployment).”6) Sherwin-Williams. “(Its) pricing power relates to its control of its own distribution, as well as its outsized leverage to professional painting contractors.7) Starbucks. “SBUX remains the category leader in the high-margin, premium coffee segment and benefits from selling an often-craved, habitual product.”

960,CELG,"Stocks have been moving in line with the price of oil this year, and Wednesday was no different, as the major averages ended higher.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each rose 0.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today fell 12% on the NYSE and 9% on the Nasdaq compared to Tuesday, according to preliminary data.Investors have used oil prices as a barometer for the global economy, selling when oil prices fall and then buying when crude rises. U.S. crude prices jumped more than 4% Wednesday, rising back above $38 a barrel.As might be expected, oil stocks led the gains. Chevron (CVX) paced the Dow industrials, rising more than 4%. Outside the Dow, Tesoro (TSO), a refiner, rose more than 5%.But there were pockets of success elsewhere. LGI Homes (LGIH) popped nearly 10% in huge volume after the homebuilder posted a 121% gain in Q4 profit to 75 cents a share, beating Wall Street forecasts. Sales rose 63% to $176.8 million, slightly below views.Meanwhile, biotech stocks took a hit after the government announced a test program to lower Medicare drug costs. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) plunged 5%, Amgen (AMGN) dropped nearly 3%, and Celgene (CELG) lost more than 1%.Dollar General (DG), El Pollo Loco (LOCO) and Children's Place (PLCE) are due to report quarterly results Thursday.Economic data scheduled for Thursday include initial jobless claims for the week ended March 5 and the Treasury budget for February.

962,CELG,"Celgene (CELG), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) are looking to sidestep Eli Lilly's (LLY) recent Alzheimer's flop ahead of the annual American Society of Hematology conference Saturday through Tuesday in San Diego, RBC and Evercore analysts said Wednesday.IBD's biotech group is down markedly since Nov. 23, when Eli Lilly announced that its solanezumab had failed to show a statistically significant effect on cognition in Alzheimer's patients, a failure that surprised analysts and investors. But on Nov. 23 itself, the group actually rebounded to the plus side after first falling.""Investors are trying to look at things with a more glass-half-full optimism,"" RBC analysts wrote in a research report ahead of the ASH conference. "" ... there are buyers looking to accumulate biotech given where we've come from over the past year.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is ranked fourth in IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group with a Composite Rating of 97, meaning it performs in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It also checks in at No. 44 on the IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks. Get the Stock Checkup for your best bets in biotech.RBC likes Celgene, Kite, Spark, Prothena (PRTA), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Evercore analyst John Scotti is keeping track of CAR T-cell therapies from Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Kite, and combination data from Celgene.Celgene is expected to unveil phase-three data on Revlimid in post-stem-cell-transplant multiple-myeloma patients. The expanded use could drive an additional $500 million to $1 billion in annual revenue and help Revlimid become the standard of care, RBC says.Celgene stock dropped 3% by the closing bell on the stock market today, to 118.51, after touching a one-year high of 127 on Nov. 9. IBD's 422-company Biomed/Biotech group was down 2.5% at the close Wednesday, and it's fallen 3.9% since Lilly's Alzheimer's trial announcement.Evercore's Scotti looks for Celgene to discuss early clinical data on a next-generation drugs using the chemical cereblon. CC-122 is aimed at diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and CC-220 could treat sarcoidosis — growths of inflammatory cells on different body parts.In other areas, Celgene has partnered with Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) on luspatercept for anemia in patients with rare blood disorders and Agios Pharma (AGIO) for AG-221, which could treat mutated proteins that are tied to certain cancers. Scotti expects updates on those partnerships.Both look for CAR T-cell data from Kite in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, after Juno last week placed its JCAR15 trial on clinical hold following the deaths of two patients. Kite also has phase-two DLBCL data. Previous data show 80% and 76% overall response rates in transplant and chemo relapsed patients.This ""will likely support a broad label assuming in presentation the CR (complete response) remains strong,"" RBC analysts wrote. Six-month durability data is also important, but that won't be available until Q1, they noted.Other key reports include amyloidosis data from Prothena, hemophilia data from Spark, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) data from Alexion, graft vs. host data from Incyte (INCY) and Hodgkin lymphoma data from Seattle Genetics, RBC wrote.RELATED:Kite Pharma Soars As Cancer Drug Trial Supportive of FDA ApprovalEli Lilly's Alzheimer's Drug Fails Key Trial; Lilly, Biogen DiveAmgen, Biogen, Celgene Eye M&A In Trump's 'Pro-Biotech' World

963,CELG,"U.S. stock indexes pushed to fresh all-time highs Thursday afternoon, as volume continued to rise.The Nasdaq popped 0.5%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4% and 0.55%, respectively. Small caps led as the Russell 2000 jumped 1.5%. Volume in the stock market today was up across the board.Turnover has trended mostly upward in recent sessions. Over the past five sessions, the winning groups include: steel makers, up 9%; consumer loans, up 8%; chip stocks, up 7%; and retail apparel and shoes, up 7%.Retail is a bit of a surprise. The retail sector is a laggard (No. 22 among 33 sectors) but scored 30 new highs Wednesday, a tally surpassed only by the red-hot banking sector.Apparel and shoes featured some big gainers Thursday. Tailored Brands (TLRD) — formerly Men's Wearhouse and since 2014 the owner of Jos. A. Bank — gapped up 40%. The small-cap company reported surprisingly strong quarterly results after Wednesday's close.Lululemon Athletica (LULU) leapt 15.6% on unexpectedly strong quarterly results reported late Wednesday.A rotation into retail and apparel would be healthy for the stock market. Strength in retail stocks would suggest an increase in consumer spending is ahead. A recent IBD/TIPP survey found economic optimism in the U.S. has surged to a 10-year high.Stocks that moved early in the Trump rally have done well. For example, 15 stocks in the IBD 50 broke out in the week of the presidential election. Fourteen went onto double-digit gains and these were sometimes from breakaway gaps. The only stock that didn't pay off was biotech Celgene (CELG), which is now about 5% below its buy point. And that downward move was largely fallout from President-elect Donald Trump's critical comments on drug prices.The successful breakouts elsewhere confirm the wisdom of an old IBD rule: When the stock market goes to uptrend (as it did Nov. 9), an individual investor should try to buy at least one breakout, and buy additional breakouts if the first stock works.Since then, the uptrend came under pressure Dec. 1 but then signaled a resumed uptrend Wednesday. Individual investors should again be shopping for breakouts to buy.RELATED:Are Apple And FANG Stocks Ready To Join Trump Rally?

964,CELG,"Shares of rivals Kite Pharma (KITE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) tanked Tuesday following presentations at the annual American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference, but Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) stock enjoyed its third day in the black on ""compelling"" gene therapy data.Kite and Juno are both investigating chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy therapies to treat a variety of cancers. They compete against the likes of Celgene (CELG), Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Amgen (AMGN). CAR T-cell therapies engineer patients' immune cells to treat cancer.On Monday and Tuesday at ASH, Juno and Kite presented results of CAR T-cell therapies to battle aggressive non-Hodgkins lymphoma. On the face of those results, Juno's treatment is stronger, showing an 80% overall response and 60% complete response vs. Kite's 76% objective response and 47% complete response.But RBC analyst Michael Yee is skeptical.""Competitive-wise coming away from ASH, Juno's JCAR-017 does not look significantly better than Kite's lead KTE-C19, and Kite is at least one year ahead, in our view,"" he wrote in a research report. ""Juno is saying on market 'as early as 2018' but we believe this will be a stretch and think 2019-plus.""IBD'S TAKE: Allergan recently bought into the gene therapy world with its acquisition of RetroSense Therapeutics. But analysts say the two companies' approaches differ. Meanwhile, Allergan's CEO has pledged to abstain from ""predatory"" pricing in gene therapy.Yee is awaiting six-month data from Kite. Juno saw complete response drop to 42% at month three and another CR fall at the six-month mark, he wrote in a research report. This suggests there could be some ""erosion"" for Kite six months out, ""but anything above 25%-30% is still very good.""Juno's strong Non-Hodgkin lymphoma results follow the deaths of two patients in a CAR T-cell trial for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Juno temporarily placed that trial on clinical hold and shares toppled 24.5% on Nov. 23 as a result.Despite the strong results, Kite and Juno stocks fell on the stock market today. Kite stock fell 4.7% to 51.10, after earlier plunging as much as 7.2%. Yee blamed short-sellers taking profits for the deluge.Juno stock toppled as much as 8.3% to a record low, ending the day down 4%, at 19.60.Spark stock, on the other hand, continued to gain Tuesday. Shares rose 14% to 57.56, up for a third day following Spark and Pfizer's (PFE) hemophilia B gene therapy presentation on Sunday. Spark made its IPO in 2015, with shares priced at 23.Hemophilia B patients have missing or defective factor IX, a clotting protein. Seven patients infused with Spark and Pfizer's gene therapy, SPK-9001, showed a mean factor IX activity level greater than 28%, 12 weeks post infusion.The first patient to reach one year post treatment showed factor IX levels at 33% of normal, Spark said.Key opinion leaders (KOLs) in a lunch with Yee called Spark and Pfizer's therapy ""compelling."" If phase 3 data shows factor IX above 30%, ""then KOLs will absolutely consider this for patients,"" he wrote.RELATED:Celgene, Kite, Spark Look To Sidestep Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's Flop

965,CELG,"Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) could look to M&A following Donald Trump's election as 2017 sets up with fewer regulatory hurdles and a likely biotech resurgence, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Monday.Biotech stocks have surged since Trump's election, largely on the notion that he will be less likely to pressure drug prices than Hillary Clinton and likely to push business-friendly legislation, including tax incentives to repatriate cash to the U.S.With the election uncertainty over, Yee expects the big four biotechs to make good on M&A plans as capital remains inexpensive and organic growth slows. Trump appears poised to embrace innovation within his administration, Yee wrote in a research report Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs aren't alone in experiencing a Trump effect. Defensive stocks are on a furious upswing following the election. Should you get in on these five defensive stocks now? Get IBD's Industry Themes for the answer.To that end, Trump met with Patrick Soon-Shiong over the weekend. Soon-Shiong is a biotech exec and the former CEO of Abraxis BioScience, which Celgene acquired in 2010 for $3 billion. There's no telling what will come of Trump's meeting with Soon-Shiong, Yee noted.Regardless, investors are starting to key in on the pro-biz environment. Since the election, shares of IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group and the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) are nearly 15%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF (IBB) is up more than 9%.""Barring any big policy surprises out of Trump, there is an increased feeling of pro-business including pro-biotech within the GOP,"" Yee wrote. ""So we see it as unlikely that any major legislation should derail innovation.""Those increases are merely the beginning, Yee wrote, noting, ""If good things happen, we believe stocks can go much higher."" Alzheimer's data in late 2017 or early 2018 from Eli Lilly (LLY) could be a catalyst. Biotechs will also likely update 2017 guidance in January, potentially pushing stocks higher.No. 3 biotech Celgene is most de-risked in the postelection world, with no near-term catalysts and no ""fear of any big disappointments,"" Yee wrote. Celgene has multiple sclerosis data due in the first half of 2017, but likely won't raise 2020 guidance in January.But Celgene stock could dip on a dilutive deal, he noted.""We'd view any pullback as a buying opportunity because the long-term tail question is sufficient pipeline — and that's what long-term investors want to see (near-term earnings variance is less important than tail questions),"" he wrote.Meanwhile, Amgen and Biogen will likely ""be OK,"" but uncertainty remains on shares of BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Yee wrote.Biogen stock could bound on strong Alzheimer's results from Eli Lilly. Amgen stock is still suffering the fallout of Q3 commentary on Enbrel pricing in 2017.On the stock market today, Celgene stock lifted 1.8% to 124.14. Shares of Amgen, Biogen and Gilead were all up a fraction. Vertex stock was down 0.4%, with BioMarin shares down 1.7% to 87.50.RELATED:Can This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

970,CELG,"Stocks rebounded in early afternoon trading Thursday amid strong earnings reports and a rebound in oil prices.The Nasdaq was up 0.9%, the S&P 500 climbed 0.6% and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%. Volume was running higher on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq compared with the same time Wednesday.Oil was up 3%, climbing above $33 a barrel, after Russia's energy minister reportedly said Saudi Arabia proposed that oil-producing countries cut output by 5% to bolster plunging crude prices.The reports boosted oil stocks such as Devon Energy (DVN), which jumped 9%, and oil and gas transporter Kinder Morgan (KMI), which rose more than 8%. Yet both stocks remain battered, down more than 60% off their 52-week highs.Elsewhere in the stock market today, social media giant Facebook (FB) and athleticwear maker Under Armour (UA) soared after their quarterly earnings reports.Under Armour rocketed 20% after reporting that Q4 profit rose a better-than-expected 20% from the same period last year on a 31% gain in sales. Chief Financial Officer Brad Dickerson also dismissed concerns about a possible decline in market share. Volume was huge as the stock retook its downward-sloping 50-week line.Facebook soared more than 15%, leading the IBD 50.

972,CELG,"In times of increased market volatility, it pays to have two managers run slightly complementary investment strategies in one fund. You could say it’s just one more way to diversify.USAA Aggressive Growth Fund (USAUX) has been around since 1981. As the name suggest, this aggressive growth mutual fund invests in large-cap companies with a strong growth trajectory. The mutual fund focuses primarily on U.S. equities, but can also invest up to 20% in foreign stocks.The $1.2 billion fund charges a 0.88% fee and requires a minimum investment of $3,000. Top 10 holdings represent nearly 30% of the fund and include companies such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Visa (V), Facebook (FB), Home Depot (HD) and Celgene (CELG).The fund carries an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it has outperformed 95% off all other mutual funds in that period.The fund has returned an average 9.16%, 7.33% and 4.85% over the past three, five and 10 years. It is off 12.81% so far this year vs. declines of 13.03% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 9.17% for the S&P 500.While the fund’s advisor is USAA Asset Management, two subadvisors are actually making the day-to-day investment decisions for the fund: Wellington Management, led by  Paul Marrkand, and Winslow Capital Management, led by Clark Winslow. The fund's long-term allocation tends to remain around 50-50 for both managers, with slight deviations of a couple percent during major market swings.""It has two managers that approach investing in growth companies in a slightly different way,"" said Wasif Latif, head of global multi assets at USAA Investments. ""So, while investment results are not 100% complementary, they do have complementary features that over time offset each other to some degree from an excess return standpoint.""Winslow takes the path of a very aggressive growth manager, seeking out really high-growth companies and buying them up aggressively, he explained. ""Their style I would say is more typical of the aggressive growth space.""Wellington, on the other hand, even though working in the same universe of companies and using the same Russell 1000 Growth index as their benchmark, is ""not as aggressive (as Winslow) because their style and their process has an additional dimension of looking at the quality of the company and paying a little bit of attention to valuation.""Wellington selects growth companies while also looking at the stability of their earnings, their growth rate and valuation. ""What ends up happening is you have two managers that complement each other in a way that if the market is very strong, high momentum, really focused at nothing but growth ... then you should expect Winslow to do really well and Wellington to do OK and continue to match or try to keep up with the market.”On the flip side, a choppier environment, where growth begins to get questioned and high-growth companies don't get rewarded by the stock market, Wellington will do somewhat better than Winslow. Both companies use a bottom-up approach to select stocks and can hold the same names in their part of the portfolio.""When you have a skilled manager that can actively manage within their space, you should expect that over the long course of time, their performance will add value on its own,"" said Latif.The fund has an annual turnover rate of 55%, on the low side for growth funds, which typically hit 100%. But though the fund has fallen with the stock market, its manager haven't been sitting idle. In the period ended Dec. 31, the trimmed back on several positions, including Apple and Celgene.

If market laggards are selling off, could that activity rotate money into stronger groups?Still, the bulls would like to see this situation change. In a normal uptrend, new highs hold the upper hand. New-low tallies fade to two digits. Peculiar has no place at the table.One niche of normalcy is found among top-rated stocks. They continue to make new highs.On Tuesday, Google (GOOGL) bounded to a new intraday high in strong volume but reversed to a modest gain.Facebook (FB) added 0.5%, scoring a new high for the sixth time in seven sessions. Volume was heavy.Celgene (CELG) popped to a new high, though volume was only moderately higher.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) also poked to a new high. Volume, though, was a fifth slower than usual.Total System Services (TSS) thrust more than 1% to a new high in strong volume. The midcap company is a payment systems provider.While the tally of new highs and lows might engender some concern, it is a secondary gauge. For more certain guidance, stay focused on the market itself.Click here to view the full list of 52-Week New Highs & Lows.

1022,CELG,"This week's list of leading stocks near buy points includes a healthy dose of medical names, from biotechs to managed care providers. The biotech revival began prior to Celgene's (CELG) 7% jump Wednesday on its $7.2 billion buy of Receptos (RCPT). Celgene is extended past a 121.57 cup-with-handle buy point.But Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still in play from a 116.93 entry after finding support at its 10-week moving average. The move didn't create a new buy opportunity, since it occurred below the buy point. But the stock is within the 5% buy zone.Also in buy range is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), trading just above a 554.10 flat-base buy point. The pattern is late stage, which is not surprising given the eye drug maker's 76% advance the past year.United Therapeutics (UTHR) hasn't yet broken out, but it's nearing a 190.39 buy point of a late-stage flat base. The IBD 50 stock, whose lead drugs are Orenitram and Remodulin, gets a 98 Composite Rating.Biotechs moved up to No. 2 among IBD's 197 industry groups, up from No. 5 six weeks ago. Hospitals claim the top spot vs. No. 10 six weeks back.Representing the No. 9-ranked generic-drug group, Allergan (AGN) is just above a 315.10 handle buy point cleared Monday. Formerly known as Actavis, the Botox makeradded double-chin injection Kybella with its June buy of Kythera.Mallinckrodt (MNK), also a generic-drug maker, is working on a four-month consolidation with a 132.70 buy point. The stock looks poised for a third straight weekly gain to close above its 10-week line.Among other medical stocks, ethical-drug maker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is building a flat base with a 246.11 entry. The Canadian company is the leader in the No. 11-ranked group, with the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating.Molina Healthcare (MOH), a provider of managed health care services to low-income families, is nearing a 74.08 flat-base buy point.

1023,CELG,"Are you a savvy equities portfolio manager?Let's get more specific. Do you consistently practice sound techniques and follow smart rules that, over time, enable you to boost your wealth and outperform the market itself?IBD is the only major news organization in the country that regularly presents readers with a set of proven buy and sell rules via the Investor's Corner educational column to enter stocks in the timeliest way possible; to capture as much gains on the upside in the best merchandise in the market; and to minimize drawdowns by raising cash, selling losers quickly, and taking gains on the way up when the market is topping.Buy and sell rules, however, are just two facets of the practice of smart portfolio management.What else should you learn and know?One of the biggest debates in investment history is how much, or how little, should one invest in any one particular stock — let alone how much should be devoted to equities in the first place.Investors are often advised to diversify their stock portfolios to minimize risk. But IBD research shows that it's actually less risky and more rewarding to own just several carefully chosen stocks and to monitor them carefully.Watch A Free IBD Webinar On Portfolio Management: Nov. 16""The best results are achieved through concentration, by putting your eggs in a few baskets that you know well and watching them very carefully,"" IBD founder and Chairman William J. O'Neil wrote in ""How To Make Money In Stocks.""To be sure, diversification can lower risk by reducing an investor's exposure to any one stock. But a big portfolio of 20 or 40 names can be unwieldy, leading to confusion and weak returns.""Keep things manageable. The more stocks you own, the harder it is to keep track of all of them,"" O'Neil wrote.And what if you enter a full blown bear market and just sit, thinking that some of your stocks will be fine?That strategy proved disastrous during the 2008-09 Wall Street debacle. No industry group within the market was spared. Even the Dow utilities average fell more than 48%. The correlation risk among all sectors in the equity market was too high to ignore. Remember, the market had galloped higher for years after stocks bottomed in 2002.Choose a limited number of stocks that can be followed easily. This involves first creating a watch list focused on industry-leading companies with top-notch fundamentals. And no matter if you are an individual trader or a financial advisor, always conduct thorough research before buying any stock.People with $20,000 to $200,000 to invest should limit their holdings to four or five stocks. Those with $5,000 to $20,000 should consider buying at most three stocks, and those with around $3,000 should limit their holdings to two stocks, O'Neil writes.Once a watch list has been created, the investor's job is to make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend and that the chosen stocks are hitting their buy points after forming sound bases.The Big Picture column and accompanying Market Pulse table, plus the Stock Checkup tool, found in the Research section of Investors.com, are excellent places to research current market conditions and individual stocks.The research doesn't end after the stocks have been bought.It's important to keep an eye on the fundamentals of each and developments in their chart patterns, a difficult task with a big portfolio.Often, stocks that have broken out will go on to form three-weeks-tight patterns or other structures that offer secondary buy points that allow investors to add shares.If you concentrate more money into such winners, you are in effect giving the portfolio a chance to compound gains in your very best decisions.Now, that's called giving your portfolio the fuel to power a big total return.In other cases, further research may reveal a new stock that looks poised for a strong run. As a result, it may be best to sell a lagging stock and move the cash into the new one, or into a better-performing stock within the portfolio.""The winning investor's objective should be to have one or two big winners rather than dozens of very small profits,"" O'Neil said.Diversification, he added, is ""plainly and simply often a hedge for ignorance.""In 2012, the S&P 500 gained as much as 13% from Jan. 1 through a high on April 2. The accompanying table of stocks that broke out after the Dec. 20 market follow-through shows how it's possible to beat the market.Priceline Group (PCLN), InvenSense (INVN) and others were able to enrich an investor's portfolio faster.Priceline moved from a 549.10 buy point to as high as 774.96, up 41%. When it cut through its 50-day line near 680 on May 10, an investor could sell and still reap a 24% profit.Celgene (CELG) went on to become a big winner on IBD Leaderboard, breaking out again in January 2013 en route to big gains the next two years.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the June 26, 2012, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Will It Arrive?

1025,CELG,"President-elect Donald Trump is likely to take on the Affordable Care Act, meaning biotech and drug stocks aren't in the clear following Hillary Clinton's defeat, analysts said Wednesday, after a year of political pressure on the industry.Though Clinton was seen more likely to wage bureaucratic battle against ""excessive"" drug prices than Trump, the Republican and his allies have repeatedly blasted the ACA -- known as ObamaCare -- with the president-elect promising he would ""repeal it, replace it and get something great.""""This legislation ... has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don't work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices,"" Trump says on his website. ""ObamaCare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country.""Trump proposes a system based on ""free-market principles,"" but hasn't delved into specifics. On Tuesday, Republicans also retained a majority in the House and Senate, making Trump's path to repeal the ACA easier. How any such repeal would hurt drug stocks is unknown, but it adds uncertainty to the industry and could weigh.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen could be heading for a breakout on an experimental spinal muscular atrophy drug in partnership with Ionis. How close is Biogen stock? Check out Industry Themes for the skinny.Hospital stocks tanked Wednesday on the trump win, but biotech and drug stocks rode the anti-Clinton wave, rising on the likelihood Trump won't go after excessive drug prices and, with a Republican Congress, probably won't touch Medicare reform.IBD's 421-company Biomed/Biotech industry group jumped 9.7% in midday trading on the stock market today, while the 44-company Ethical Drugs climbed 5.7% and 18-company Generic Drugs group surged 7%. As of Tuesday's close, the groups had been down 26%, 27% and 29%, respectively, for the year.But their lift will likely be short-lived, RBC analyst Michael Yee said, advising that investors buy on the Brexit-like dip. The broader market will likely assume ""a risk-off environment and sell-off in the short term with 'Trump uncertainty' emotion,"" he said.But ""biotechs should bounce since we don't see anything that fundamentally was negative for biotech,"" Yee wrote in a research report.He recommends Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), BioMarin (BMRN) and Prothena (PRTA) stocks.Of those, BioMarin and Vertex led the way midday Wednesday, with Vertex soaring by 11.9% and BioMarin surging 10.1%. Celgene stock skipped to a 10.7% gain%, Prothena catapulted 18% and Biogen climbed 8.2%.Tuesday's election resulted in a ""best case scenario"" for biotechs, Yee said. Besides a president and a Congress less likely to meddle in drug pricing, Proposition 61 in California failed 54%-46%. Prop 61 would have limited state agency spending on prescriptions to what the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays.Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost to Clinton in the primary, was a major proponent of Prop 61. But in the Republican Senate, Sanders' name is likely to lose some of its power. Yee sees it's unlikely he'll be tapped to chair the Health, Labor, Education, Pension (HELP) committee.RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseClean-Energy Stocks Plunge On Trump WinApple, Microsoft Eye Trump's Overseas Cash Tax Plan

1026,CELG,"Small-cap biotech Axovant Sciences (AXON) could pull in $2 billion to $4 billion in sales on an Alzheimer's drug, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Tuesday — pitting it against big players like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Eli Lilly (LLY).Early Tuesday, Axovant reported Q3 losses and told investors that it expects to wrap up a key phase-three trial for its Alzheimer's drug intepirdine by year's end. Yee expects data by mid-2017.""We see 60% probability of success for phase 3 (intepirdine), on a $2 billion to $4 billion Alzheimer's drug, which could result in five to 10 times potential upside,"" Yee wrote in a research report. He has an outperform rating and 40 price target on Axovant stock.But Axovant stock toppled on the stock market today. Shares were down 7.2% to 11.15, at a five-month low, following the Q3 earnings report. Losses per share ex items widened to 43 cents from 12 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts expected a 37-cent loss.Axovant made its initial public offering in June 2015, pricing shares at 15. The company hasn't yet reported sales.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are trading positively for the third consecutive day. Biogen could be among the leaders in that pack on early efficacy in a phase three trial of a spinal muscular atrophy drug in conjunction with Ionis. Get the full scope in Industry Themes.The Alzheimer's market is huge, with big players Gilead, Celgene, Biogen and Eli Lilly all looking to take a chunk. Axovant most closely rivals Danish drugmaker Lundbeck, which has two phase-three trials due in 2017 on its drug idalopirdine.Intepirdine and idalopirdine have similar mechanisms. Both are 5HT6 antagonists that aim to assist cognition and memory. But Lundbeck's idalopirdine has safety issues and Yee gives it only a 20% probability of success.Lundbeck's idalopirdine ""is using doses below the levels needed due to safety issues for that drug, and thus we would not overly read into it if it were negative,"" Yee wrote in a research report.Axovant is also testing nelotanserin to treat the ""visual hallucination"" symptom of Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia. Data are expected in February from a phase two trial of 20 patients. But, Yee notes, the consensus has no expectation for that trial, considering the size.""If data were great (strong numerical reduction in hallucinations), we believe we could see a 20%-25% move for Axovant vs. minor downside if negative,"" he wrote, noting that Alzheimer's data later in the year is more important for the stock.RELATED:Eli Lilly Q3 Revenue, EPS Miss; CEO Praises Drug Pipeline

He has a 164 price target on the stock, down a fraction to 138.45 on Tuesday.""Before Amgen's most recent Q3 call, we thought of Amgen largely as a 'ho-hum' steady stock, a jogger if you will,"" he wrote. ""However, since Amgen's Q3 call (about 1.5 weeks ago), the stock has come down about 12%.""Enbrel commentary during the Q3 call spooked investors, he says. Sales of the immunosuppressant were flat at $1.45 billion and, given contract negotiations, Amgen expects ""relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017"" for Enbrel.Wall Street has been predicting a decline in Amgen's legacy businesses for some time. But Syed sees a silver lining in new drugs, like Amgen's Repatha, a cholesterol-busting PCSK9si rival of Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron's (REGN) Praluent.Repatha already has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but sales have suffered on restricted access, Syed wrote. Repatha is currently in phase 3 testing to treat cardiovascular outcomes and, in September, met primary and secondary endpoints in a phase 3 test for coronary artery disease.CV data are expected in Q1. Syed calls this ""the most important data event for Amgen."" A positive event could pull Amgen stock out of the dumps. Shares hit a two-year low Friday, though they managed to close up fractionally for the day.Gilead managed the impossible in 2013-14 after it launched Hepatitis C (HCV) drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni and tripled its revenue to become a $30 billion company, Syed wrote in a separate report. But the duo are cures for HCV and, therefore, won't last forever.""The flip side of developing a cure is eventually the disease will be eradicated,"" he wrote. ""While great for patients, this means declining revenues over time. This has been weighing on Gilead's stock as the answer of slope of decline isn't exactly clear.""For Q3, Gilead's hep C trio -- Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa -- brought in $3.3 billion in sales, down 31% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Epclusa, which launched in June and July in the U.S. and Europe helped to offset declines in Sovaldi and Harvoni.Syed models 10% year-over-year declines in HCV sales for Gilead.But Gilead is working on its next leg of growth, Syed says. He has an 88 price target on Gilead stock. Its nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Hepatitis B (HBV) drugs are still too early in their pipelines. Plus, Gilead is facing NASH competition from Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Allergan (AGN).Gilead isn't ""a table-pounding buy,"" but the stock is undervalued and the company will likely perform over time, rewarding patient investors, Syed wrote.Gilead stock rose 4 cents Tuesday to 74.04.If Celgene is a castle, chemotherapy drug Revlimid is its moat, Syed says. During Q3, Revlimid sales grew 30% vs. last year to $1.89 billion, driven by new market share gains and increased duration. Revlimid is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).Revlimid ""allows Celgene to grow its next sources of revenue,"" Syed wrote in a separate report. ""(Revlimid is) still a growing part of the business and a value add to Celgene, but this part of the business is fairly well established and mature.""Inside its moat, Celgene has cancer drugs durvalumab and CAR-T in conjunction with AstraZeneca (AZN) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), respectively. Celgene is also working on its next-generation replacement for Revlimid, which is expected to go generic in 2022 and be fully generic in 2026.At its core, Celgene has ozanimod, currently in phase 3 testing for multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis, and GED-301, an investigational Crohn's disease drug. These are central to Celgene's investment thesis, says Syed. He has a 130 price target on Celgene stock, which rose 0.89% Tuesday to 108.45.RELATED:Which Four Biotechs Are Derisked And Buyable Ahead Of Election Day?Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: AnalystGilead NASH Drug 'Active And Promising,' But Lagging InterceptAllergan Challenges Intercept With Tobira NASH Drug

1028,CELG,"Leading tech stocks tumbled last week as mutual funds sold shares in the likes of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google. But the manager of $3 billion Franklin DynaTech Fund, an IBD Best Mutual Fund 2016 Award winner, isn't panicking.Judging by DynaTech's (FKDNX) lowly portfolio turnover rate of 31% and comments by lead manager Matthew Moberg on the power driving growth in several key holdings, the fund remains hitched in a big way to the market's leading stocks.DynaTech has an outsized bet on technology, with a 48% weighting as of June 30, according to Franklin Templeton.That sort of megabet on a single sector could make a fund volatile. But this fund's performance is consistent as well as strong. The fund was up 3.15% so far this year as of Oct. 31. The S&P 500 was up 5.87%. DynaTech's return topped 78% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged a 0.91% gain.The fund generated average annual returns of 8.42%, 13.2% and 9.26% the past three, five and 10 years.The fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner for having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard. It was in the top 100 in three categories: all U.S. equity, all large caps and all growth funds.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersMoberg, 45 years old, has been shepherding DynaTech since 2004. He talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in San Mateo, Calif.IBD: Matthew, why does the fund have such a large technology weighting?Moberg: The fund focuses on innovation and growth.Our name, ""DynaTech,"" stands for dynamic technologies. We define dynamic as a force that stimulates change or progress. Innovation is where the bulk of wealth creation occurs. But we view this as a broad mandate. We're able to look for innovation anywhere.And we believe you need active management to invest in innovation. It's a part of the market that is often misunderstood. Some people believe it is too expensive, or too unknown. So that's an area we look through because those misunderstandings mean opportunities get overlooked.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance LeadersIBD: Is your current tech weighting typical for the fund?Moberg: It's been as high as 50%. But sector classifications change. Amazon (AMZN) is now classified as a consumer discretionary stock. Early on, it was tech.Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are holdings. They're still considered information technology companies. But one could argue that they are financials.We look for innovation, which can be found in a lot of places.IBD: Health care was your second largest sector, with a 27% weighting. That's another hotbed of innovation, right?Moberg: It's not a great year for health care because of the election (and some candidates talking about price controls). But, yes, there's a lot of innovation there. You see it in possibly emerging treatments for diseases like hepatitis C, cystic fibrosis, even cancer.IBD: What are some names you like in that space?Moberg: Celgene (CELG) and Incyte (INCY).Click Here To See A List Of Biggest Mutual Funds Ranked By PerformanceIBD: Is the fund's performance consistent because it is diversified? Because it's exposed to other sectors, not just tech and health care? Why else?Moberg: Yes, we are diversified. And consistency is also due to our fundamental research. Sometimes we find stocks that the market doesn't appreciate how quickly they will come to market. The best example is Facebook (FB). They launched their mobile ads in Q2 2012. In the first quarter they only did $13 million in revenue. That was 1.3% of their total revenue. Two years and three months later, mobile was doing $1.659 billion. That's more advertising revenue than CBS' $1.63 billion in the similar quarter.Technology adoption is accelerating. The world is more global. Investors often don't appreciate how fast a new technology rises. So we try to think long-term. Our short-term performance is just a byproduct of how we think long-term.IBD'S TAKE: See how near Facebook and other highly rated stocks are to proper buy points. Visit IBD's Leaderboard.IBD: What part of Facebook's story do you like the most now?Moberg: First, mobile usage. Mobile ads will be more effective than other ads, one could argue. Facebook probably has the best set of mobile applications. And there's a runway for growth there.Second, they're starting to monetize Instagram, where people share pictures. The next step is to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. Usage on them has been explosive. And there's a good chance that this goes into commerce (rather than remain solely a social activity).Finally, when you're thinking about what they could monetize five or 10 years out, Oculus (which makes a virtual reality headset) is another interesting acquisition. Facebook didn't pay much for it. And they can probably monetize it in five to 10 years. It has a long runway, like Messenger and WhatsApp.IBD: Edwards Lifesciences (EW) seems to be benefiting from a new management fiscal discipline and from a key new product, their transcatheter aortic value replacement (TAVR).Moberg: Yes, right now they're going through a very nice product cycle with TAVR. It had a rough start. But now TAVR is an example of a sensational innovation. It enables patients to avoid the need for open-heart surgery, cracking open your rib cage, making a giant incision. Instead, they put the TAVR in through an artery with a small incision. Patients spend less time in the hospital, go through less pain. And with each iteration, the valve gets smaller and easier to insert.That product cycle will last another five-plus years.They're also working on something for mitral valves, which are harder to reach. We hope and expect them to be the leader in that field as well. If they can do it, it would double their addressable market.IBD: Edwards had disappointing sales in Q3 and its stock plummeted. How has this changed your outlook for the company and stock?Moberg: We remain positive on Edwards Lifesciences. Edwards is still in the early stages of capturing the transcatheter aortic valve replacement opportunity (65% share of a $2.5 billion or so market that is only about one-third penetrated).  Its stock also fails to account for any potential for the transcatheter mitral valve replacement opportunity, and mitral valve disease is twice as prevalent as aortic valve disease.  It has faced missteps in new products before — again the world doesn't work as linearly as we would like — but we believe this is an excellent business.IBD: I'll make a wild guess that you are not one of those investors who finds Amazon's product experiments wasteful.Moberg: They're incredibly innovative. They're continually investing in new things. They've had three big successes. The first was Prime. They get money upfront (from consumers). And it drove up usage of Amazon significantly. The second was letting third parties sell on the website, with fulfillment by Amazon. It required no investment in inventory, and generated higher margins.In addition, they have Amazon Web Services, which is increasingly important. It's one of the fastest growing software-as-a-service companies ever.Amazon continues to invest, find new ideas. They've had quite a few failures along the way, but I understand you need to take risk to succeed. That attitude gives us confidence in their continued growth.IBD: Any concerns about Amazon's miss on Q3 results? Any sign of more weakness to come?Moberg: They have gone through many investment cycles in the past. Step-ups in investments don't always, in fact rarely, work within a quarterly reporting cycle. We understand that.  Over the long term Amazon has had very good returns on invested capital, prefers to grow organically and has a culture of innovation.  We didn't see anything in the quarter that suggests that is no longer the case.IBD: Pioneer Natural Resource (PXD) is somewhat new to the portfolio. But it has seven straight quarters of slowing earnings. What's your thesis?Moberg: We like to invest in small positions, see how they do and try to hold on for the long-term. If anything fundamental changes and it's right, we add to it.Pioneer is one of the best positions in oil services. They are one of the lowest priced producers. We think oil will stabilize in the 50 to 60 per barrel range.IBD: Why do you like Chinese online gaming company NetEase (NTES)?Moberg: We believe the gaming space is a secular winner. NetEase has some games that have done well. And the secular trends on gaming are better in China than in the U.S., and it is very strong in the U.S. We will see more virtual reality and different kinds of games and ways for people to spend leisure time playing games.IBD: Do you still like Broadcom (AVGO) as much as you used to?Moberg: We don't believe it is as innovative as it used to be. Most of their accelerating earnings per share is due to consolidation. We prefer companies with innovation, which this was at first.Still, they are doing a great job buying companies, rationalizing costs, raising prices. Their CEO is incredibly well thought of in the (chipmaking) industry. He's executing on strategy extremely well. We're pleased that someone is taking the lead and starting consolidation in that industry.IBD: Nvidia (NVDA) is another relative newcomer to your portfolio. What do you like about their chipmaking?Moberg: They were viewed as a provider of graphics chips inside PCs. Then they expanded, making chips inside game consoles. Now they're broken free of that prison and making central processing units for virtual reality. They're also needed in cars, for autonomous driving. Also in hyperscale servers, they're used as co-processors. CAD-CAM, artificial intelligence — their total addressable market is exploding.We think there's a lot of sustainability to the company and a long trajectory for earnings growth.IBD: You have exposure to the pet care industry. What do you like there?Moberg: It's shocking how well we treat animals now vs. 20 or 30 years ago. Cancer treatment, CT scans — they were unavailable years ago. So we like the secular trend. The company we like most and have owned longer and have the largest position in is Idexx Labs (IDXX). Idexx is a particularly well-positioned business competitively, given its unique ability to single-handedly bundle both outsourced diagnostics and in-practice diagnostic instruments.  Idexx also offers superior information management capabilities regarding animal diagnostic reporting and record-keeping relative to competitors.IBD: What's special about Aspen Technology (AZPN), the software firm?Moberg: They do supply-chain management for process industries. This software is so important that even when companies go bankrupt, they pay their Aspen bill. It is the backbone for many companies.They have tremendous operating margin and profitability. There's some competition, but if you are a serious and large company, you need their technology. And customers are incredibly sticky.IBD: Tell me about your co-manager.Moberg: I am lead manager. The fund was founded in 1968. Rupert Johnson, my co-manager, was the fund's first manager. And as you may know he is also vice chairman of Franklin Resources.IBD: Matthew, people often wonder what portfolio managers do in their off hours. How about you?Moberg: I used to run 25 miles a week. I used to have hobbies. Now I have a 7-, 5- and a 1-year-old. They're my hobbies.And I forgot to mention that I'm an avid reader of history. I was a history major in college. I find that useful in looking at micro trends, adoption rates, periods of major and minor innovation, and pattern recognition of new technologies, as well as macro trends like low interest rates, Federal Reserve actions, periods and government responses.RELATED:Top Mutual Fund Manager Captures Solid Returns Without Messy EmotionsThis Top Mutual Fund Manager Wins With 3 Flavors Of Growth StocksHow Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund Targets Stocks With GiddyapHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The Downturn

1029,CELG,"SAN FRANCISCO — Big biotechs Celgene and Vertex Pharmaceuticals disappointed investors with their 2016 guidance, while gene-sequencing giant Illumina previewed a variety of futuristic products, at a major investor conference Monday.
"
1030,CELG,"The news at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, sent Celgene (CELG) and Vertex (VRTX) stocks falling Monday, while Illumina (ILMN) shares rose a fraction.
"
1031,CELG,"Celgene said Q4 EPS totaled $1.18 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter but missing by 9 cents the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Product sales (which cover not quite all of revenue) were $2.54 billion, in line with Wall Street's revenue estimate.
"
1032,CELG,"Celgene is scheduled to report final Q4 earnings on Jan. 28.
"
1033,CELG,"For 2016, Celgene guided EPS of $5.50 to $5.70, up 19% from the expected final 2015 number but on the low side of analysts' $5.68 projection. Product sales were guided at $10.5 billion to $11 billion, while analysts forecast revenue of $11.1 billion.
"
1034,CELG,"Nonetheless, Celgene added 5 cents to its 2020 EPS guidance, which it had already raised last summer, to $13 from $12.50.
"
1035,CELG,"Celgene also said that in March, Bob Hugin, who's led the company for 17 years, will become executive chairman and hand the CEO job over to Mark Alles, currently the president and COO. Alles, in turn, will hand his position to Jacqualyn Fouse, now the president of Celgene's hematology and oncology franchise, which makes up the majority of its business.
"
1036,CELG,"Scott Smith, who heads the inflammation and immunology business, will add the role of chair of the Global Management Committee.
"
1037,CELG,"Regarding Q4, Celgene said it included a 7-cent charge due to a $70 million milestone payment to OncoMed (OMED) stemming from positive data of demcizumab, a cancer drug that Celgene has licensed. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a research note that it was ""unclear"" whether the consensus forecast had factored that in, but he wrote that both the other numbers were basically in-line.
"
1038,CELG,"Speaking at the conference, Hugin said that in Q4, Celgene had to absorb a 17-cent hit from closing its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos, which brought potential blockbuster immunology drug ozanimod. He was highly optimistic about Celgene's budding immunology franchise in general; psoriasis drug Otezla launched in 2014 and brought $472 million in 2015, which Hugin called ""the most successful launch of any therapeutic in the history of this therapeutic area in terms of its progress in this first full year of launch.""
"
1039,CELG,"Analysts were divided about the management changes. Schoenebaum wrote that the changes had generally been expected, but RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote that the CEO transition seemed early.
"
1040,CELG,"""We believe investors will debate the changes and what could result or what Alles may do going forward,"" Yee said in a research note.
"
1041,CELG,"Celgene stock slid 5.5% Monday, to 103.03.
"
1042,CELG,"Illumina Teams With Bill Gates
"
1043,CELG,"Illumina stock, meanwhile, seesawed Monday before closing up a fraction at 165.71, after a battery of announcements from the company. On Sunday, it said that it was launching a new business called Grail, with several partners including Microsof t (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Bezos Expeditions, the family foundation of Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. The aim of the company is to develop a new genetic test for early-stage cancers that can be derived from a simple blood sample.
"
1044,CELG,"On Monday, it announced the MiniSeq System, the simplest, cheapest gene sequencer that it has yet produced. The MiniSeq, expected launch this quarter, is priced at $49,500, with each sample costing about $200 to $300 to process, CEO Jay Flatley said at the conference.
"
1045,CELG,"Also Monday, Illumina unveiled a new partnership with Bio-Rad (BIO) to develop a next-generation sequencing solution to analyze a single cell. Single-cell analyses are useful in understanding cell variations in cancer and other diseases, Flatley said, but normally they are analyzed only from a small batch. Illumina and Bio-Rad aim for a high-throughput solution combining their technologies, which they expect to launch late this year or early next year.
"
1046,CELG,"Flatley also previewed a handheld sequencing device Illumina is working on called Firefly, based on CMOS technology the company acquired a couple years ago. That will be a ways down the road, however.
"
1047,CELG,"Flatley also said he expects revenue to grow 16% this year, in line with consensus, while EPS guidance of $3.55 to $3.65 a share was below the Street's $3.72 estimate.
"
1048,CELG,"Vertex Key Drug Beats
"
1049,CELG,"Vertex stock fell 6.1% to 103.95 after its preliminary Q4 results and 2016 guidance Sunday disappointed investors. But Vertex said its flagship cystic fibrosis (CF) drug Kalydeco sold about $180 million, beating consensus of $165 million, according to Evercore.
"
1050,CELG,"New CF drug Orkambi, which launched in the summer, sold $220 million, a hair above consensus.
"
1051,CELG,"For this year, the company forecast $670 million to $690 million in Kalydeco sales and $1.18 billion to $1.23 billion in operating expenses but didn't forecast Orkambi sales.
"
1052,CELG,"The Kalydeco guidance appears to be 10% below Street views, analyst Schoenebaum wrote in an email, but he said the company's guidance has been conservative the past two years.
"
1053,CELG,"He says Vertex is waiting on additional information from its launch before giving Orkambi guidance. Analysts expect Orkambi to sell $1.5 billion this year.SAN FRANCISCO — Big biotechs Celgene and Vertex Pharmaceuticals disappointed investors with their 2016 guidance, while gene-sequencing giant Illumina previewed a variety of futuristic products, at a major investor conference Monday.The news at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, sent Celgene (CELG) and Vertex (VRTX) stocks falling Monday, while Illumina (ILMN) shares rose a fraction.Celgene said Q4 EPS totaled $1.18 a share, up 17% from the year-earlier quarter but missing by 9 cents the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.

1054,CELG,"After six months or so of talks, Big Pharmas Shire and Baxalta early Monday announced a merger, valued near $32 billion, that they said would create the No. 1 company in drugs to treat rare diseases.
"
1055,CELG,"Ireland-based Shire (SHPG) will pay Baxalta (BXLT) shareholders $18 in cash and 0.1482 of a Shire ADS (American Depositary Share) per share owned. They said that comes to $45.57 per Baxalta share, based on Friday's closing price.
"
1056,CELG,"But Shire stock fell 8.9%, to 169.37,, Monday, and is down 37% from its July 29 peak above 270. Baxalta stock fell 2.3% Monday, to 39.10. Baxalta stock hit its all-time high of 41.65 on Thursday, gaining 2.5% last week on expectations of a takeover, despite it being the market's worst first week of trading ever. Shire stock fell 9.1% last week.
"
1057,CELG,"The companies expect the deal to close midyear, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. They said the transaction values Bannockburn, Ill.-based Baxalta at a 37.5% premium to its stock price on Aug. 3. They had disclosed Aug. 6 that negotiations had been ongoing since at least July 10, when Shire made an unsolicited offer for Baxalta, at $45.23 per Baxalta share.
"
1058,CELG,"Baxter International (BAX) spun off Baxalta on July 1 in a bid to unlock some shareholder value in its biopharma operations while holding on to its medical product business. Baxalta retained the franchise of bloodderived treatment for diseases, such as hemophilia and primary immunodeficiency.

Apple gained 1.9%.The Season For StarbucksMany compulsive coffee drinkers probably got gift cards this holiday season from Starbucks, the ubiquitous coffee chain.On Tuesday, Starbucks predicted that sales of its gift cards would set a record on Christmas Eve as people rush to buy last-minute presents.The Seattle-based company has cultivated a loyal fan base not only through coffee but also through newer food offerings, loyalty programs and advancements in mobile payments.Starbucks shares climbed 2.9% for the week and have been grinding their way through a flat base begun in November.Home For Christmas Via Alaska AirAirlines will be busy through the holidays and are set to reap strong profits in 2016 as cheap oil keeps fuel costs down. Alaska Air Group, the company that runs Alaska Airlines, was among the strongest IBD airline stocks this week, finishing up 2.7% this week.The stock cleared a flat base on Dec. 2, but shares have settled lower since. Still, the stock has found support at its 50-day line.Nike Struggles Despite Strong OrdersAthletic-wear giant Nike on Tuesday reported fiscal Q2 earnings that beat views and sales that missed, but it reported strong growth in futures orders — that is, orders that are set to be delivered over the next several months and are a key indicator of demand.Shares jumped initially on the news, but concerns about high inventory and future gross margins later sank the stock.The stock dipped 1.7% for the week.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

1130,CELG,"This week's IBD 50 list of top-rated growth stocks adds business social network LinkedIn (LNKD) and computer networking company Arista Networks (ANET). Also joining is Paycom Software (PAYC), a cloud-based payroll-and-HR company, and a raft of biotech and medical technology firms.With strong growth, all three also make IBD's tough Sector Leaders screen, where Arista is the new kid on the block. It sports the best EPS Rating and the best three-year sales growth in IBD's 29-company computer networking industry, with the cloud computing trend putting its network switches to work in data centers. Paycom is in the enterprise software industry group. ranked No. 11 out of the 197 groups that IBD tracks. Meanwhile, LinkedIn, also a Leaderboard stock, is sporting double-digit EPS and revenue growth. It's in the No. 1 rated Internet-Content group.Besides these three, five more tech companies clambered onto the IBD 50 this week: biotech Celgene (CELG) and United Therapeutics (UTHR), musculoskeletal implant maker Globus Medical (GMED), robotic surgery system maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and laser manufacturer IPG Photonics (IPGP).Monday's biggest movers out of the new IBD 50 tech stocks were Arista Networks, which gapped up 4% in its fifth-straight trading day of rises, and Celgene, which gave back 2.5% from last week's rally related to resolution of a patent dispute over its blood-cancer blockbuster drug, Revlimid.Of all these stocks, Paycom is up the most so far this year, 46%. Cumulative performance for the IBD 50 itself is a 7% gain so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is about flat for 2015.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.RELATED: IBD 50 Tech Stocks: Alibaba Added, Web Shopping Jumps.

1132,CELG,"A good stock idea isn't much use if you don't understand what you're looking at. Is it an institutional-quality stock? Is it a cyclical play that probably will only profit from its industry cycle? Is it a turnaround story that involves the fixing of a company problem? Is it a fad stock that will run hot until people tire of the novelty?
"
1133,CELG,"The strategy and target will differ for each of these situations, and it will vary by the kind of uptrend the market is in.Peg the stock wrong or the market wrong, and you will probably lose money or at least make less than you should.If an investor is going to make big money, institutional-quality stocks, operating in a strong uptrend, will most often be the investor's best choice. However, there are times when a cyclical stock, turnaround or fad stock can deliver good gains.Where can an investor find or identify great stock ideas? Your Weekly Review (YWR), also known as the 85-85 list, is a good place to look in Friday's IBD.In this screen, stocks must score an 85 in EPS Rating and in Relative Price Strength Rating. The 85 means that the stocks must be in the top 15 percentile among stocks in IBD's database. Stocks also must be within 15% of a 12-month high.Charts are listed by industry group, but charts aren't printed for every stock. Additional stocks are listed in the fine-print listing on the last page of YWR, today on A8.The big net makes the 85-85 a good place to look for stock ideas. A low-hurdle screen will pick up more cyclicals, turnarounds and fad stocks than a high-hurdle screen.Some people sneer at ""fad stocks."" They argue that such stocks are dangerous, won't last and aren't for serious investors.Well, all stocks are dangerous. While fad stocks might have a shorter life, sometimes all we're talking about is a solid company indirectly benefiting from a fad.For example, egg producer and distributor Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) rode the Atkins diet to big stock gains in 2003.In other cases, fads develop into longer-lasting trends.For instance, Deckers Outdoor (DECK) bought UGG Holdings in August 1995 and eventually turned the Ugg boots — once popular mostly with surfers — into a broader fashion trend.From October 2002 to October 2011, Deckers Outdoors shares rose 9,193%, with Uggs deserving much of the credit.How might the 85-85 be used?Let's look at the 85-85 screen that was published in IBD on Oct. 24, 2014, not long after a market low and the Oct. 21 follow-through day. A follow-through day soon after a market low is often the best time to scout for breakouts, retaking of buy points and bounces off the 10-week moving average, as seen in the minicharts.An investor could've found five institutional-quality stocks in the 85-85 that soon set valid entries: Apple (AAPL), Celgene (CELG), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Illumina (ILMN) and Skyworks (SWKS). Gains varied from 15% to 79%.Four cyclicals in the 85-85 eventually offered entries: Landstar System (LSTR), Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), FedEx (FDX) and Lennar (LEN). Gains ran from 11% to 15%.Turnarounds and fads were scarce.The market itself was and had been choppy, which is why taking a 10% to 15% profit in Apple was prudent.

1134,CELG,"The stock market often does what's least expected, and that certainly has been the case lately. Consider these four recent occurrences: A heavy distribution-day count for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in recent weeks didn't do much damage to the market. In fact, the market uptrend resumed Thursday when the Nasdaq marked an all-time closing high, rising 1.3% in higher volume.After showing signs of a climax top last month, Ambarella (AMBA) found support at its 10-week moving average again, rising nearly 12% for the week.Regeneron (REGN) is holding near highs despite a series of breakouts from late-stage bases.And right when it looked like Centene (CNC) was going to roll over after a massive price run, it's back above its 50-day moving averageSo it goes in today's market.The good news is that the action in several other IBD 50 names has been far from confusing. The IBD 50 rose 3.6% for the week, ahead of the S&P 500's 2.4% gain but below a 4.25% gain for the Nasdaq.Celgene (CELG) gapped out of an 18-week, cup-shaped base Wednesday, rising 7% in strong volume, after it announced plans to acquire Receptos (RCPT) for just over $7 billion. One of Receptos' key drugs is multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis treatment ozanimod. It's not approved yet, but early trials have been promising.Celgene's weekly chart looks solid. It's still in a buy range, just over 3% above a 129.16 buy point.Small-cap Fleetmatics (FLTX), a member of Wednesday's list, is at the high end of a buy range from a 48.06 cup-with-handle buy point.Monster Beverage (MNST) is in a similar boat as it trades near a 139.75 buy point.Meanwhile, several IBD 50 names are reporting earnings this week.Illumina (ILMN) and Blackhawk Network (HAWK) report Tuesday after the close. Celgene and Valeant (VRX) report Thursday after the close.Valeant is working on a late-stage, flat base with a 246.11 buy point. The base is strengthened by several tight weekly closes.Valeant has pursued an aggressive growth-through-acquisition strategy in recent years. Earlier this year, it bought Salix Pharmaceuticals for around $14.5 billion. In 2013, it scooped up Bausch & Lomb for nearly $9 billion.Q2 profit at Valeant is seen rising 29% from a year ago to $2.46 a share.

1135,CELG,"Three top-20 industry groups from the Medical sector showed nice price action Monday. All three groups have been long-time market leaders and a number of stocks within the groups are shaping late-stage bases.
"
1136,CELG,"Shares of generic-drug giant Allergan (AGN), formerly know as Actavis, cleared a 315.10 cup-with-handle entry Monday. Volume was modestly above average.

1137,CELG,"Allergan will report Q2 earnings before the open on Aug. 6. Analysts are looking for per-share earnings to climb 28% to $4.39 on sales of $5.72 billion, up 117%. Sales estimates are boosted by the recent Allergan acquisition.

1138,CELG,"Also from the generic-drug camp, Mallinckrodt (MNK) is tracking sideways in a consolidation that dates back to March. In May the stock cleared a short handle buy point at 130.35, but reversed lower and triggered an 8% loss sell signal a few weeks later. The handle can only be seen on a daily chart. For now, Mallinckrodt faces a test of resistance at its 50-day moving average.
"
1139,CELG,"From the biotech group, Celgene (CELG) briefly cleared a 121.57 handle buy point intraday, but retreated by the close. Volume was light.

Celgene will report Q2 earnings results before the market open on July 23.

1140,CELG,"Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) is approaching a 544.10 buy point in a late-stage flat base. The stock is finding support at its 10-week line, but has already made a huge run, which makes it a riskier buy if the stock breaks out.

1141,CELG,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) jumped Monday and is trying for a sixth straight weekly advance as it climbs the right side of a consolidation pattern. The stock is back near an all-time high it set in December after months of sideways action and a sharp drop in the spring.

1146,CELG,"American Century Ultra (TWCUX), a marquee name in the mutual fund industry, had a dynamite third quarter. Its 6.49% gain popped past the 5.59% average surge of its large-cap growth rivals as tracked by Morningstar. And the fund soared above the S&P 500, which tacked on a relatively modest 3.85% advance.So far in Q4 the $8.2 billion mutual fund is down 1.93%, going into Thursday. A lot of that is due to a slide by technology and tech-related names that dominate the fund's top holdings. They have been out of investors' favor in recent weeks. Until this past week, that is.A sustained rebound by those names could give a nice boost to the fund — Tuesday and Wednesday those names showed signs of doing that.Four tech or tech-related names are top-10 holdings that have IBD Composite Ratings of 80 or higher. So does top new buy Xilinx (XLNX).IBD'S TAKE: The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.Apple (AAPL), the top holding as of Aug. 31, was down 7% since Oct. 24. Alphabet (GOOGL) was down 7%. Amazon.com (AMZN) was down 11%. Facebook (FB) was down 17%. All had portfolio weightings of 8% to 4% as of Aug. 31Three gained ground Tuesday and Wednesday. Facebook and Xilinx rose on Tuesday.They had sold off amid investors' worries that multinational companies like those are high-profile targets for retaliation by foreign governments if President-elect Donald Trump sparks a trade war.One big change for the fund since IBD last profiled it in May: While information technology remains its largest sector, now with a weighting of 33%, consumer discretionary has replaced health care in the second slot with a 22% weighting. Health care still has a 17% weighting but has fallen to the sixth position.Amazon — which combines online retailing with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-services platform — is the biggest consumer discretionary name. Starbucks (SBUX) is another. The coffee-shop chain has a modest 70 Comp Rating. Shares recently retook their 10-week moving average, a sign its recent downtrend may be ending.Meanwhile, some health care holdings have already provided lift for American Century Ultra, with runs that began in the days before the election.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and biotech Celgene (CELG) are among the fund's top 10 holdings and have Comp Ratings of 88 and 97 respectively. They benefited as investors rotated into health care stocks amid expectations that a Republican Congress and White House will ease pressure for new pricing rules for drugs. Investors also expect ObamaCare to be reformed.In addition, the market reacted favorably to UnitedHealth's profitable third quarter reported last month — earnings per share rose 23% — and to its raised guidance for 2016.Celgene's Q3 revenue jumped 28% as EPS grew 28%. In addition to productive products Revlimid, Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane, Celgene got multiple sclerosis treatment ozanimod in its 2015 acquisition of Receptos. It's also being tested for treating ulcerative colitis. And mongersen is being studied for treatment of Crohn's disease.Wall Street analysts are forecasting 22% earnings growth over the next five years.Donaldson (DCI) also got a postelection boost. The maker of air and liquid filtration systems is up on expectations that a Trump administration will seek infrastructure improvements. EPS grew 16% and 2% the past two quarters after four stanzas of slowing growth.Scripps Networks (SNI), which runs six national media networks and has an 86 Comp Rating, broke out above a flat-base buy point of 68.54 Monday. AT&T's (T) pursuit of Time Warner (TWX) — whether a Trump administration would green-light the deal or not — shows the value of media content.IBD's TAKE: Take a look at IBD's Stock Checkup to learn how four consecutive years of EPS growth and annual return on equity of 44.3% help make Scripps the No. 1 stock in IBD's diversified-media industry group.Xilinx in October pulled back 12% after setting a 52-week high, but has since regained most of the loss. The chip designer, which has a 90 Comp Rating, had EPS growth of 8%, 11% and 27% the past three quarters. Those steps up followed five frames of declining EPS growth. The most recent results, for Q2, beat many analysts expectations. The stock also has a 2.5% dividend yield.The California-based chipmaker's industrial-defense division — whose sales rose 11% in Q2 — could benefit from a boost in defense spending under Trump.RELATED:How A Top Mutual Fund Plays This Volatile MarketAmerican Century Ultra Stays Focused On Leaders

1147,CELG,"President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Congress will likely seek faster drug pipelines, buoying Medidata Solutions (MDSO) and other medical software firms, KeyBanc analyst Donald Hooker said Monday, as drugs stocks rose again.The emphasis on faster pipelines will come amid reduced drug pricing scrutiny and Trump's plan to incentivize repudiating cash to the U.S., Credit Suisse analyst Kennen MacKay wrote in a separate research report. He predicts a Trump presidency will likely keenly boost the biotech sector.On the stock market today, Medidata stock helped lead IBD's 17-company Computer Software-Medical industry group, which was up 1%. Medidata stock was up 4.2% to 55.53, its seventh straight gain. Hooker has an overweight rating and 65 price target on shares, and he says the macro backdrop has improved for Medidata following Trump's election.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and drug stocks have flown on Trump's win, but uncertainty exists in his intentions for the Affordable Care Act. Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full skinny.""Rising drug prices have become a major political issue this year,"" Hooker wrote in a research report Monday. ""Instead of price controls, we suspect that Republican solutions will more likely involve regulatory reforms that speed up approvals on new drugs and create greater competition.""Trump could ""make drug development great again,"" he quipped.Hooker sees 20% organic growth for Medidata in 2017 given the likely improving regulatory and legislative landscape for information technology in drug development. Medidata has enterprise deals with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Boehringer Ingelheim.IBD's biotech industry group rose 6% the day after the election, though it fell Thursday and Friday.

Investors are more bullish on the sector given Trump's proposals to incentivize returning cash to the U.S.Still, ""we caution that health care/pricing could be one of the areas where Mr. Trump makes concessions with Democrats,"" he wrote in his research report. Seattle Genetics (SGEN) stock reacted richly to Trump's election, he noted.RELATED:Incyte Recoups Losses After Price-Fixing Fracas On Strong Chemo ResultsMylan Third-Quarter Earnings Fall Short But Stock Steady

Biogen stock rose.The USPTO declined to hold a trial in response to Bass's request for inter partes review (IPR) on Tecfidera's patent with a number ending in 514, which expires in 2028. The office cited a ""failure to establish a likelihood of success as to any challenged claim"" as the reason. Another challenge on a shorter-lived patent, '393, is still pending. That patent expires in 2019.The IPR filing was made by the Coalition for Affordable Drugs, a group created by Bass as part of a ""short activist strategy"" that he claimed would also reduce drug prices. The group has also filed IPRs against Jazz Pharmaceuticals' (JAZZ) Xyrem, AbbVie's (ABBV) Imbruvica, Celgene's (CELG) Revlimid, and Shire 's (SHPG) Lialda and Gattex, among others.Last month, however, the USPTO also denied an IPR against Acorda Therapeutics ' (ACOR) Amypra. The Biogen ruling may be further evidence that the strategy won't work, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note.""Today's win was an unexpected positive as we expected a decision by mid-Nov. based on filing dates, and this comes on the heels of Acorda's win, despite consensus of 60-70% IPR institutions,"" Yee wrote. ""Street could view this as a further positive derivative and give less credit to other IPRs filed by similar anti-patent groups.""Yee noted, however, that drug startup Forward Pharma (FWP) is also challenging the '514 patent, as it has developed its own similar drug.Biogen stock has been severely battered since its massive guidance cut back in July, with its IBD Relative Strength Rating down to just 25 despite an EPS Rank of 96.

""2015 should still be a good year for the industry, once we pass through this latest round of selling.""Schimmer wrote that profitable big caps such as Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) are ""attractively valued relative to peers.""On the other hand, he said money-losing big caps such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) are more difficult to value.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, in his report, wrote that ""it's reasonable and makes sense to us that some correction and profit taking has been possible given the significant outperformance in the first 3 months of 2015.""Yee noted that there were some ""over-exaggerated"" moves by some of the smaller biotechs last week, such as the CAR-T stocks (Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) jumped 24% and Kite Pharma (KITE) rose 14%), which in turn revived long-running concerns about a biotech bubble.Kite stock was down 10% in midday trading in the stock market today, while Juno stock was down 2% after falling more than 7% Wednesday.Yee added, however, that real bear markets are driven by poor fundamentals, which he says aren't evident yet in biotech.""We're watching our '3 pillars of risk': biosimilars (in flux), pricing/rebating, and IP risks, but these seem to be risks to individual companies but not to the whole sector,"" he wrote.Thursday marks the fifth straight trading-day decline for IBD's 368-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech group, which has slumped nearly 12% in that span. For now, though, it still ranks No. 1 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.RELATED:Biotechs On Track For Worst Week In A Year.

1233,CELG,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

1234,CELG,"Biotech Gilead Sciences handily beat first-quarter expectations and raised its revenue guidance Thursday, capping off a busy day for big-cap drugmaker earnings. Gilead (GILD) reported earnings minus one-time items of $2.94 a share, up 99% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 62 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue jumped 52% to $7.59 billion, more than $600 million above Wall Street's estimate.
"
1235,CELG,"Gilead doesn't give EPS guidance, but it added $2 billion to its full-year product-sales target, now $28 billion to $29 billion. That's up 14% to 18% from 2014.
"
1236,CELG,"Essentially the entire revenue beat came from the hepatitis C drug Harvoni. In its first full quarter on the market, Harvoni notched $3.5 billion, well above analysts' $2.2 billion estimate. Its predecessor Sovaldi, however, missed expectations at $972 million. Gilead's HIV franchise, once the mainstay but now a minority of revenue, also came in below forecasts.

1256,CELG,"Novo's stock rose 1.2% to 56.27.Biotech Gilead Sciences handily beat first-quarter expectations and raised its revenue guidance Thursday, capping off a busy day for big-cap drugmaker earnings. Gilead (GILD) reported earnings minus one-time items of $2.94 a share, up 99% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 62 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue jumped 52% to $7.59 billion, more than $600 million above Wall Street's estimate.Gilead doesn't give EPS guidance, but it added $2 billion to its full-year product-sales target, now $28 billion to $29 billion. That's up 14% to 18% from 2014.Essentially the entire revenue beat came from the hepatitis C drug Harvoni. In its first full quarter on the market, Harvoni notched $3.5 billion, well above analysts' $2.2 billion estimate. Its predecessor Sovaldi, however, missed expectations at $972 million. Gilead's HIV franchise, once the mainstay but now a minority of revenue, also came in below forecasts.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the guidance raise is especially significant.""This company tends to be conservative, so for them to raise revenue guidance this early in the year speaks volumes,"" he wrote in an email to clients.On the conference call with analysts, commercial-operations chief Paul Carter said that the U.S. HCV patient base seemed to be ""somewhere north"" of the 250,000 that Gilead had predicted last year. He added that Q1 was the first in which the franchise has picked up significant numbers of patients in Europe, which reached about 20,000.Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges, who last week said that Gilead ought to buy fellow big-cap biotech Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), delicately brought up what it might be doing with all its cash.CFO Robin Washington said that Gilead does keep an eye out for M&A; opportunities, but said it prefers ""phase-two or earlier-stage assets."" That would seem to cut against Vertex, which already has commercial products.Gilead's stock rose about 2% in after-hours trading. Shares had closed down 1.8% at 100.51.AbbVie (ABBV), which has a rival hepatitis C treatment, Viekira Pak, was steady late. It beat EPS estimates last week.Earlier Thursday, Israeli generic-drug giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) reported adjusted EPS of $1.36, up 11.5% and beating views by 11 cents.Sales dipped to $4.98 billion but beat estimates by $150 million. Excluding currency headwinds and divestments, sales rose 8%.Teva raised its EPS guidance for the year by 5 cents to $5.05 to $5.35, implying the profit upside is not going to be sustained. The biggest threat on the horizon is the U.S. launch of generic versions of its best-seller Copaxone, whose date is uncertain but likely to take place by September.Teva's stock slid 2.7% to 60.42.Celgene Sales MissCelgene (CELG) reported a mixed quarter. EPS rose 27% to $1.07, a penny above views. Sales grew 20% to $2.08 billion, missing consensus by more than $30 million.The big biotech affirmed full-year guidance for $9 billion to $9.5 billion in product sales and EPS of $4.60-$4.75. Last year it made $3.71 a share on $7.67 billion in revenue.U.S. sales of flagship blood-cancer drug Revlimid beat esti mates, but foreign Revlimid sales and all other individually reported drug sales missed consensus.Celgene stock dived 4.5% to close at 108.06.Danish diabetes specialist Novo Nordisk (NVO) reported earnings of 3.79 kroner (50 cents) per share, up 56% and beating consensus of 3.31. Revenue rose 24% to 25.2 billion kroner ($3.3 billion), about 80 million kroner ($10.5 million) above consensus.Novo Nordisk hiked its 2015 profit growth guidance to 17% from 10% and added a percentage point to the low end of its sales growth guidance, to 7%-9%.President Kaare Schultz said he is leaving Novo, following a management reorganization that eliminated his other job, chief operating officer.

1341,CELG,"It's old hat that biotech ETFs are beating the stock market. But three are new launches flying under the radar of many investors. BioShares Biotechnology Products (BBP) holds stocks such as Celgene (CELG) and Anacor Pharmaceuticals (ANAC) that have shone of late. Two others focus on businesses in the clinical trial stage.""These are very innovative ETFs investing in companies at the cutting edge of medical research,"" says Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research. She thinks they can keep beating their peers, as they have since their December 2014 launch.ALPS Medical Breakthroughs (SBIO), which invests in companies with at least one drug in clinical trials, tops health care sector ETFs with a 55% spike this year. BBP scored 40.3% stock market gains and BioShares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC) 38.5%. By comparison, the more established iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) is up 28.8% year to date.Biotechs have led the stock market for several years. The still-steep ascent is drawing some caution. Some analysts worry about lofty valuations. Not Mishra.""There are still many reasons to be positive on the industry,"" she said, citing a merger uptick, positive drug-trial results and more industry-friendly FDA approvals.What the three debutante ETFs share in common is a skew toward small- and midcap biotech players.An equally weighted ETF, BBP invests in 39 stocks with an average market cap of $3.5 billion. Anacor, an outperformer in the past year, made headlines this week on positive data for an experimental skin ointment. Other holdings with triple-digit gains in the last year include Momenta (MNTA), Dyax (DYAX), Biomarin (BMRN) and Retrophin (RTRX).The cap-size skew is paying off. Bigger, more well-known biotech companies rely on new therapies from smaller firms that they acquire, given the time-consuming nature of drug development and the ""alarming rate of failure"" involved, Mishra said.On the flip side, smaller companies tend to be more volatile in price. And for companies in clinical trial stages, chances of failure are high. That makes ETFs holding these companies high-risk, high-reward bets for investing success.Still, strong inflow for these ETFs reflects investors' hopes for gains. They absorbed roughly $146 million combined in new money in the first six months of the year.Assets have grown at a rapid clip, especially for SBIO. It started 2015 with roughly $2.5 million. It now holds $161.5 million.New ETF strategies involve inherent risks. Funds sponsors could shut down the product if it fails to gather sizable assets. Investors may face higher trading costs in the form of wide bid-ask spreads.""Investors with lower risk tolerance should focus on broader biotech ETFs,"" Mishra said.

1403,CELG,"Alexion stock soared 7% to 185.92. It broke out of an eight-month base, trading just below February's record high.
"
1404,CELG,"As usual, all revenue came from Soliris, which Alexion launched for the rare disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in 2007, and for the equally rare hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in 2011. On the conference call to discuss results, CEO Leonard Bell remarked that Soliris is still acquiring newly diagnosed PNH patients at about the same rate as it did at its launch, while aHUS ultimately looks to be an even larger market.
"
1405,CELG,"Bell also said Alexion has completed the last component in its rolling FDA submission for approval of its second drug, asfotase alfa. It started the process earlier this year, but needed to complete its study of the natural history of hypophosphatasia, the genetic bone disease that asfotase alfa treats. Like the other diseases Alexion targets, it's very rare, so the FDA wanted data on the disease's normal progress to contrast with the patients in asfotase alfa's clinical trial.
"
1406,CELG,"Alexion didn't release study results, but Martin Mackay, head of research and development, said they were consistent with what the company expected. He said the drug should launch in the U.S. and Europe early next year, and in Japan later in 2015.Celgene and Alexion Pharmaceuticals stocks jumped Thursday after both big-cap biotechs beat third-quarter estimates and raised their guidance.Celgene earnings rose 24% vs. a year earlier to 97 cents a share excluding one-time items, beating analysts' estimates by 2 cents. Sales grew 18% to $1.98 billion, about $20 million more than Wall Street's forecast.The biotech guided full-year revenue at $7.6 billion, up 17% and in line with consensus. It added a nickel to its EPS guidance, now $3.65 to $3.70, also in line and up from $2.98 last year.But Celgene did trim its 2014 outlook for its cancer drug Abraxane to $850 million, up 31%. It had expected $850 million to $900 million. Abraxane's Q3 sales missed consensus, as did sales of newly launched psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla.No Worry Over Misses Yet""Investors have been asking if Abraxane ($212 million vs. consensus $232 million) and Otezla, which missed ($18 million vs. consensus $28 million and RBC $18 million), are cause for concern,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a note Thursday. ""We don't think so — yet — especially as Otezla is very early in launch.""Celgene also announced a collaboration with Sutro Biopharma to develop antibodies and antibody drug conjugates to create immuno-oncology drugs. The new deal expands a December 2012 pact, with Celgene increasing its stake in Sutro to 15% and Sutro receiving $95 million upfront.Celgene stock hit a record 100.92 intraday, closing up 6% at 100.40. The stock has risen 14% this week, helped by upbeat data on a new Crohn's disease drug.Alexion earnings rose 53% to $1.27 a share before one-time items, 11 cents beyond estimates. Sales climbed 31% to $555 million, about $13 million more than consensus.The biotech raised and narrowed its full-year sales guidance, to a range of $2.22 billion to $2.225 billion vs. $1.55 billion last year. It added more than 15 cents to its EPS guidance, now $5.15 to $5.20 vs. $3.08 last year.Soliris Still Attracts PatientsAlexion stock soared 7% to 185.92.

1425,CELG,"Lagging biotech stock Epizyme (EPZM) suddenly came to life Monday, jumping more than 30% in the wake of positive weekend data on its lymphoma drug.
"
1426,CELG,"On Saturday at the annual International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma, Epizyme said that nine out of 15 advanced non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) patients in a phase one study responded to tazemetostat (EPZ-6438), a first-in-class drug called an EZH2 inhbitor. Five of nine patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma responded, as did three of five patients with follicular lymphoma.

1443,CELG,"Flemming Ornskov has been at Shire for only 18 months, but his term has been quite an adventure already.
"
1444,CELG,"In January, he closed the Anglo-Irish drugmaker's biggest acquisition, buying U.S. biotech ViroPharma for $4.2 billion.
"
1445,CELG,"That brought Shire (SHPG) deeper into the growing field of rare-disease drugs, helping it diversify from its core business in attention-deficit treatments. It has also made a number of smaller buyouts.
"
1446,CELG,"This year, Shire's biggest drama was its role in what would have been the biggest tax-inversion deal in the drug industry.
"
1447,CELG,"North Chicago-based big pharma AbbVie (ABBV) successfully wooed Shire back in July with a nearly $55 billion offer, with which AbbVie planned to cut its taxes by relocating its headquarters to Britain.
"
1448,CELG,"After the Treasury Department proposed new rules in September that would limit the benefits of such deals — and since AbbVie was legally unable to renegotiate terms — the big pharma backed out, leaving Shire with a $1.63 billion breakup fee.
"
1449,CELG,"Undaunted, on Oct. 24, Shire reported Q3 results that beat expectations.
"
1450,CELG,"Ornskov recently spoke with IBD about the AbbVie adventure and Shire's strategy.
"
1451,CELG,"IBD: When AbbVie first made its bid, you initially resisted. Apart from the issue of price, was becoming part of a big pharma ever in your plans? Is it now?
"
1452,CELG,"Ornskov: No, the situation (when AbbVie made its bid) was that we went out and put a strong case to the investors for us staying independent. We laid out the plan called 10-by-20 — achieving $10 billion in (annual) sales by 2020. AbbVie increased their offer a number of times, and eventually I think the board of Shire felt that the number they were offering was of such a magnitude that they had to recommend it. That's also the feedback they got from the investors.
"
1453,CELG,"The deal did not happen, and there can be a lot of speculation about tax deals and the importance of that. I think for us right now, the most important thing is we have a strong opportunity as an independent company.
"
1454,CELG,"We have very strong growth — we grew 33% in the third quarter compared with the similar quarter in 2013 — and I think we progressed profitability very strongly, and we progressed the pipeline. I think we now have to focus on being an independent company.
"
1455,CELG,"For the long term, I think we've made really good progress on business development. We've made at least three deals during this period of time — Lumena, Fibrotech and a company called Bikam, in the ophthalmic area. I quickly put the AbbVie situation behind me, and I think so will the team.
"
1456,CELG,"IBD: Speaking of the tax issue, Shire is domiciled in Dublin even though a lot of your operations are elsewhere. Do you see any of the proposed changes in Irish laws, or the political pressure it's been under, as affecting your business?
"
1457,CELG,"Ornskov: No, Shire's been based in Ireland for quite some time. I think we've seen that tax is a complex issue, and now for U.S. companies with the Treasury notice, people are interpreting and trying to figure out what that means for them.
"
1458,CELG,"I think at the end, tax is one of the things you have to manage in a complex environment with high demand for growth and efficiency. But for us, really, the key thing is to focus on innovation and growth, and our people and pipeline.
"
1459,CELG,"IBD: You've been diversifying away from your core ADD business. How did you wind up with the mix of therapeutic areas you're in, and what are you most focused on at this point?
"
1460,CELG,"Ornskov: Since I've come on board, we've shifted the strategy to be more focused on becoming a biotech company. We have aspirational peers, like Celgene (CELG), like Gilead (GILD), like Biogen Idec (BIIB). We find that these companies are characterized by innovative pipelines, high growth, high profitability, and very strong research focus and patient focus.
"
1461,CELG,"We like that, and we put out a strategy to take us in that direction. We have a plan to achieve 10-by-20, which is an ambitious but, I think, achievable goal, even if you exclude business development.
"
1462,CELG,"More and more of our business is in rare diseases. It is now our largest and fastest-growing business. It's true that historically we've been more ADHD, but now rare disease is a focal point going forward with investments and business development and acquisitions.
"
1463,CELG,"IBD: What size of acquisitions might we expect?
"
1464,CELG,"Ornskov: Well, Shire has always been an acquisitive company. We've made quite a number of them since I came on board. The largest we made was the $4.2 billion acquisition of ViroPharma, and I think that's been incredibly successful.
"
1465,CELG,"Not only did we acquire a product, Cinryze (used to prevent attacks of angioedema, or swelling of the face and body), with excellent growth, but also we've significantly increased the growth since we've taken it over. A product in the same disease area, Firazyr, which we already had, picked up in growth significantly. That's a good pattern for us: building on domain expertise we have, making a targeted acquisition, the performing very well with the acquired asset and the spillover effect on our existing asset.

We find that these companies are characterized by innovative pipelines, high growth, high profitability, and very strong research focus and patient focus.We like that, and we put out a strategy to take us in that direction. We have a plan to achieve 10-by-20, which is an ambitious but, I think, achievable goal, even if you exclude business development.More and more of our business is in rare diseases. It is now our largest and fastest-growing business. It's true that historically we've been more ADHD, but now rare disease is a focal point going forward with investments and business development and acquisitions.IBD: What size of acquisitions might we expect?Ornskov: Well, Shire has always been an acquisitive company. We've made quite a number of them since I came on board. The largest we made was the $4.2 billion acquisition of ViroPharma, and I think that's been incredibly successful.Not only did we acquire a product, Cinryze (used to prevent attacks of angioedema, or swelling of the face and body), with excellent growth, but also we've significantly increased the growth since we've taken it over. A product in the same disease area, Firazyr, which we already had, picked up in growth significantly. That's a good pattern for us: building on domain expertise we have, making a targeted acquisition, the performing very well with the acquired asset and the spillover effect on our existing asset.We'll look for opportunities to do that in other areas.

1533,CELG,"Biotech Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO) continued its selloff Monday as Canaccord Genuity lowered its price target based on skepticism about one of its cancer drugs.
"
1534,CELG,"Agios stock dropped 10% Friday on AG-221 clinical-trial results, though investment bank Cowen & Co. said in a research report that the numbers were misinterpreted.
"
1535,CELG,"In his report Monday, Canaccord analyst John Newman agreed with that, but focused his concern on a different project reported at the European Hematology Association conference last week: AG-120. It's another drug that Agios is co-developing with Celgene (CELG).
"
1536,CELG,"Newman noted that AG-120's effect on blood cancer seems to be moderating over time, but what really worries him is the phase-one data in solid tumors (i.e. most cancers other than blood) that are due in the second half of this year.

"
1547,CELG,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) continues to grow at a steady clip on its blockbuster drug Soliris, a so-called orphan drug used to treat a rare blood disease. At $400 a dose, it's pricey but effective and widely used. Alexion's stock jumped more than 7% on Oct. 23 to 185.92 as it broke out of an eight-month base on strong third-quarter results.
"
1548,CELG,"On an earnings call, CEO Leonard Bell said that Alexion had completed the last phase of its rolling FDA submission for approval of a second drug, asfotase alfa, a treatment for genetic bone disease. Alexion rose fractionally in Tuesday trading on the stock market today.
"
1549,CELG,"Biogen Idec (BIIB) said a day earlier that Q3 EPS rose 61% to $3.80, crushing estimates by 34 cents. Sales rose 37% to $2.5 billion, in line with views.
"
1550,CELG,"Biogen lifted its full-year earnings guidance to $13.45-$13.55, but sales of its best-selling treatment, multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, fell about $14 million short of consensus at $787 million, and shares fell 5% for the day. The stock has since recovered all of the drop and was trading above its 200-day average and just at its 50-day average Tuesday.
"
1551,CELG,"Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) said Tuesday after the market closed that iyd EPS rose 31% to $2.33, beating consensus by 11 cents. Sales climbed 32% to $306.6 million, about $4 million more than analysts expected.
"
1552,CELG,"The company lifted its full-year profit outlook above consensus views. The beat and the raised forecast came largely from strong performance of Defitelio, a specialty drug that treats a rare condition afflicting people undergoing stem-cell transplantation.

1554,CELG,"Celgene (CELG) on Oct. 23 said that its Q3 EPS climbed 24% to 97 cents, beating analyst estimates by 2 cents a share. Sales grew 18% to $1.98 billion, about $20 million more than Wall Street expected.
"
1555,CELG,"The biotech guided full-year revenue at $7.6 billion, up 17% from the prior year and in line with analyst views. But it trimmed its 2014 outlook for its flagship cancer drug Abraxane to $850 million, up 31%. Investors weren't worried and took Celgene's stock up 6% for the day. Celgene, whose stock is on the IBD Leaderboard list of top-rated stocks, fell 1.6% Tuesday.

"
1564,CELG,"Tuesday's announcement that Celgene (CELG) agreed to acquire Receptos (RCPT) pleased investors in those two stocks, but for investors in Gilead Sciences (GILD), which was rumored to be interested in Receptos, it means waiting on the edges of their seats.""Literally the only question I'm getting on Gilead is, 'When and who are they going to buy?'"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum Monday in a video recorded for clients. ""The stock has moved because of broker meetings a month or two ago where they said, 'We're ready to do a deal.'""It's a crucial question for Gilead's future, because signs are that its blockbuster hepatitis C franchise is already hitting the ceiling in the U.S. after a record launch 18 months ago. However, that launch did give Gilead an enormous pile of cash to buy its next major drug line, which has set Wall Street's collective imagination into overdrive about what the target could be.Here are some of the most prominent suggestions that have come out in the last few months: Incyte (INCY): This was suggested on Tuesday by Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya in a note mainly about the Celgene-Receptos deal. Incyte's drug Jakafi treats a rare form of bone-marrow cancer as well as a blood disease called polycythemia vera. Gilead recently entered the blood-cancer market with Zydelig, which launched just shy of a year ago for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two kinds of lymphoma. Somaiya noted that Incyte also has a promising pipeline that includes drugs for solid tumors.Incyte's 12-month revenue totaled $581 million, mostly from Jakafi, but the company has had inconsistent quarters on the bottom line. Analysts expect it to record its first annual profit next year, however, and grow rapidly after that. The stock has reflected these bullish expectations, with a Relative Strength Rating of 98 and an accumulation/distribution grade of B+. Incyte stock hit a new high of 121.70 early on the stock market today before retreating back near yesterday's close. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges caused a minor commotion when he endorsed this combination back in April. Vertex, whose own hepatitis C blockbuster was stomped out of existence by Gilead, is positioning itself as the dominant player in cystic fibrosis, as it's the only company that's proven to have a disease-altering treatment for the devastating condition. Porges pointed out that Gilead already sells a product to this market called Cayston, so it has its foot in the door.Gilead ""needs the promise or high probability of an incremental $5 billion to $7 billion of revenue to reassure investors about their future outlook,"" Porges wrote at the time, and in fact $5 billion a year is what many predict Vertex's CF drugs are going to do eventually. However, some other analysts doubted whether such a deal would happen, on the grounds that Vertex is expensive (market cap is hovering near $33 billion, and Porges' suggested price was $45 billion) and Gilead prefers to buy development-stage assets that it can then launch itself.Vertex's stock has been in a flat base since Porges floated his idea. Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN): Buying Achillion would be going in the opposite direction in terms of size, as Achillion is a startup whose market cap is just over $1 billion. However, it has been the subject of speculation, given that it has a promising hepatitis C drug candidate of its own, which could potentially help Gilead extend its franchise through the coming next generation of treatments.In November, after Achillion's candidate ACH-3102 yielded excellent six-week results in a clinical trial when combined with Gilead's Sovaldi, FBR Capital analyst Andrew Berens argued that buying Achillion could get Gilead onto ""(the) expected trend in HCV intervention towards shortened treatment durations from the currently available eight-week and 12-week courses."" Then in May, a Twitter-storm of speculation erupted when Achillion abruptly pulled out of an investor conference, suggesting that it was about to announce something big. As it turned out, it was: Achillion had actually signed a licensing deal with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which diminished the chances of a Gilead buyout. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): What, a biotech buying a big pharma? Well, actually Gilead is bigger than Bristol now — it did almost $25 billion in sales last year, vs. Bristol's $16 billion — and Bristol's hottest new drugs are biologics, like its cancer drug Opdivo. Which was what TheStreet.com's Adam Feuerstein was thinking when he proposed the idea back in January: ""I'm not sure exactly which company Gilead will buy, but the acquisition focus will be oncology, and it will be transformative, just as Pharmasset was for its hepatitis C business.""The potential is certainly vast, given that Opdivo alone is expected to pass $6.5 billion in annual sales by 2020. However, the price would be even more staggering than Vertex's, and Bristol's market value has continued to go up since Feuerstein's prediction; it's now over $115 billion. The stock hit a new 14-year high of 70.42 Wednesday before closing down more than 1%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

1595,CELG,"Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.IBD's Big Cap Leaders screen filters through highly liquid, large-cap stocks with a strong record of earnings growth. Eight top-notch medical stocks that made the screen's cut are Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Actavis (ACT), Biogen (BIIB), Regeneron (REGN), Shire (SHPG) and Illumina (ILMN). Valeant Pharmaceuticals has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning its shares outperform 99% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors. Some of those factors are earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.Valeant completed its $11.1 billion acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals on April 1. Salix and partner Pharming Group came out Monday with good interim data on the phase-two clinical trial of their conestat alfa drug, Ruconest, developed for the treatment of angioedema attacks. (That's allergy-related swelling.)Valeant shares, which eased 0.6% Tuesday, are 61% extended past a cup-with-handle base buy point of 147.39, initially cleared last December. Actavis, along with its partner Perrigo (PRGO), announced on Tuesday that its new drug application for guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine tablets, a Mucinex D alternative, was given FDA approval.Last week its eluxadoline drug, Viberzi, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, also received FDA approval.Actavis is trying to stay above a cup-with-handle base buy point of 305.87, initially cleared last Wednesday. It closed off 1% Tuesday to 305.66. Actavis has a 99 Composite Rating, the best. Gilead has an IBD Composite Rating of 98. The biotech announced on Sunday that the phase-three trial results for its idelalisib drug, Zydelig, in combination with ofatumumab, showed the improvement of progression-free survival in previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).Last week, the European Medicines Agency validated Gilead's marketing application for its emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide combination for HIV treatment. The investigational combination is now under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.Shares, which barely closed off 0.1% Tuesday at 113.94, are 2% below a 116.93 buy point from a 7-month-long price consolidation. Celgene is another biotech with a 98 Composite Rating.

"
1709,CELG,"Big-cap biotech Celgene made its name as a cancer fighter, but now it's branching out into diseases of the immune system. And one of the biggest tests of this new strategy comes this weekend.At the United European Gastroenterology Week in Vienna, which runs Saturday to Oct. 22, Celgene (CELG) is set to present phase-two data on GED-0301, a treatment for Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disease of the GI tract. Celgene licensed the drug in April from privately held Nogra Pharma for an upfront payment of $710 million, with up to $815 million in regulatory and development milestone payments and up to $1.05 billion in sales milestone payments, should the drug launch.The price raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Few had heard of Nogra Pharma, and $710 million was the most that Celgene had ever paid upfront in a licensing deal. And the only information that had been publicly released was from a phase-one trial, which had only 15 subjects and was not placebo-controlled.Celgene, however, said that it already knew the phase-two data and that it was worth the price.""GED-0301 is a potentially transformative therapy that demonstrated striking clinical activity in a phase-two trial for Crohn's disease,"" Scott Smith, Celgene's global head of inflammation and immunology, said in a press release at the time.As the date of GED-0301's release nears, Wall Street's curiosity — and optimism — has been building.According to RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, about 20% to 30% of the combined $17 billion in sales of the world's two leading immunology drugs — AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade — comes from the treatment of Crohn's disease.The cause of the disease is still mysterious, and treatment is more about management than cure. According to Yee, about a third of patients don't respond to the drugs, and for those that do relapses are frequent.So it's a potentially huge opportunity if Celgene's drug works.Still, the drug has taken a while to get much attention. As recently as Aug. 26, Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas could assert that GED-0301 was not modeled into Wall Street's consensus numbers and therefore brought a huge potential for upside.Since then, the bandwagon has gotten more crowded.On Sept. 22, Nomura Securities analyst Ian Somaiya reported on an interview with an investigator who participated in the clinical trial. Although the study was doubled-blinded so he didn't know which patients got GED-0301 and which got the placebo, the investigator reported that three out of seven patients went into clinical remission, and the response time was less than half the usual two weeks that Humira takes. Somaiya also observed no safety problems.'Strong Efficacy' Expected""We believe the full phase-two data will reflect this clinical site's findings, confirming strong efficacy seen in phase-one trial, with rapid benefit and durable remission and a clean safety profile,"" Somaiya wrote in his research note. ""We estimate GED-0301 could reach $2.2 billion in peak worldwide sales and drive upside of $7 to CELG shares.""Anticipation of the drug may have boosted Celgene's stock, which was trading near record highs before this week's market crash.Evidence that GED-0301 might be driving Celgene's rise came on Sept. 11, when the stock dropped 5% over three trading days. There wasn't any apparent reason except a short note put out late on Sept. 10 by ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum, who reported from a meeting that he'd had with Celgene's management.""New Crohn's disease drug is unlikely to be 'once daily' product,"" Schoenebaum wrote. ""This is due to theoretical risk of fibrotic changes with long-term exposure. However, company very interested in studying re-treatment and/or intermittent dosing (e.g., 3 months on/3 months off).""Fibrosis, or a hardening and thickening of the bowel wall, is a common symptom of Crohn's disease. The idea that long-term exposure to GED-0301 might make it worse seems to have spooked investors.Schoenebaum apparently blamed himself for the stock's drop, because the next day he put out a clarification emphasizing the word ""theoretical"" in his note and noted that no such problems had been reported from the trials.If all goes well, GED-0301 is expected to launch around 2017.It would be Celgene's second immunology drug after its first, Otezla, hit the market in March for psoriatic arthritis. On Sept. 23, it was also approved for psoriasis, a larger market. The Street estimates that peak annual sales of Otezla could pass $2 billion.

The trial started in March; Agios had said data will first come out next year.""Agios likes to present data only when reasonable conclusions can be drawn about a compound's activity,"" wrote Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt in a research note Friday. ""Hence ... we are optimistic that the early data release will be associated with a strong efficacy signal.""Agios is developing AG-120 in collaboration with Celgene (CELG), currently one of the biggest players in blood cancer. Also backed by Celgene is Agios' lead product AG-221, which is somewhat further along in phase one, with positive data reported earlier this year. Last month, the FDA granted it fast-track designation as a treatment for leukemia, though even with expedited review it's still years from the market.Agios has turned out to be one of the most successful of the recent glut of biotech IPOs.

1850,CELG,"Remember that new issue you bought awhile back this year when it was breaking out of a first-stage IPO base? Up 7% in heavy volume with solid fundamentals?A thing of beauty. But instead of rising even more, the stock reversed in higher volume. Then it fell again. And again. Before you knew it, you were sitting on an 8% loss just a few days after the breakout. What went wrong?It was the market.To boost your portfolio's performance immediately, invest only when the trend is upward and rising, not downward and falling.Major averages can show signs of distribution any time during a confirmed uptrend. When the selling intensifies, IBD's current outlook (see the Market Pulse today on B8) can quickly switch to ""Uptrend under pressure"" or even ""Market in correction,"" the time to be cautious, sell stocks and wait for better conditions.Never underestimate the 'M' in CAN SLIM. Just because it's the last letter in the acronym doesn't mean it carries the least importance. In fact, it's arguably the most important.You might be great at identifying names that have potential to be big market leaders, but if institutional investors are selling and major averages are going down, great stocks will have a difficult time making headway.How should you monitor the health of the broad market?Along the top of A1, you'll find a quick summary of the day's action. In the B section, the What's The Market Trend? page shows big daily charts of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq with key data. Keep tabs on the market's leading industry groups over the past six months and the day's top movers.The Big Picture, also on B8 today, guides investors through day-to-day market action, providing unique market commentary with a three-tiered market outlook scale: market in confirmed uptrend, uptrend under pressure, and market in correction. Money should be put to work in stocks during confirmed uptrends, while cash should be favored during market corrections.It can be scary when heavy selling starts to hit the major averages and the market enters into a corrective phase. Growth stocks tend to fall at least twice as much as the broad market, so it's important to keep them on a tight leash when selling starts to intensify.At the same time, it's also important to be ready when the market confirms a new uptrend with a follow-through day. Your confidence may not be high, but try to buy at least one stock. Get the vehicle in motion. If the follow-through day is strong, you'll gain more confidence and will be totally ready to scoop up more breakout opportunities.The market's latest follow-through day caught some market pros off guard, but it was a viable one on Oct. 21 when the Nasdaq soared 2.4% in higher volume on the fourth day of its rally attempt.Plenty of individual growth names were ready to participate. IBD 50 name NetEase (NTES) cleared a 91.16 buy point on the same day the Nasdaq followed through. It's been hitting new highs since then as shares remain under accumulation.Other names that started to move around the follow-through day include Lennar (LEN), Celgene (CELG), Apple (AAPL) and Boise Cascade (BCC) and SolarWinds (SWI).Lennar has proved itself the leader in IBD's home-building group. It's still holding comfortably above a 42.07 cup-with-handle buy point cleared last month.

"
1937,CELG,"Both the SPY and QQQ ETFs have a large-cap stock bent. But QQQ offers a much stronger tech stock tilt — 56% vs. SPY's 17.7%. It also allocates far more to its top 10 stock holdings, such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) — 46.9% vs. SPY's 17.2%.

It priced Tuesday night at 12 and closed at 12.57 on its first day of trading. The company operates 250 grocery and food service stores in six Western states, 13 in northern Mexico and 52 Cash & Carry stores.Inside the IBD 50, selling pressure was scant in names like Ulta Beauty (ULTA), TAL Education (XRS) and Polaris (PII).In economic news, weekly jobless claims rose 12,000 to 293,000.

Meanwhile, durable goods orders plunged 18.2% in August, a bit worse than the consensus estimate for 17.1% drop. The weakness was attributed to a 74.3% plunge in aircraft orders.

Economists expect growth of 4.6%, up from the last estimate of 4.2%.
"
2008,CELG,"The $1.8 billion Putnam Investors Fund is an old geezer. Its Dec. 1, 1925, inception date makes it the industry's second oldest stock fund.
"
2009,CELG,"But it's acting like a spry spring chicken lately.
"
2010,CELG,"Since Jerry Sullivan took over in mid-2008, the fund's average annual gain is 10.84% through Sept. 30. It tops the S&P 500's 10.02%. And it beats 91% of large-cap blend funds tracked by Morningstar.
"
2011,CELG,"In the same-length period prior to Sullivan's taking charge, the fund's 5.32% average annual gain lagged the S&P 500 and 88% of its large-cap blend peers.
"
2012,CELG,"Sullivan credits his outperformance to an appetite for both growth and value stocks. Also, he targets three types of stocks: ones he's followed for years, those pushed up and down by smart money, and special situations. And he focuses on valuation.
"
2013,CELG,"In addition, he applies lessons learned from his mentor and former boss, former Fidelity Investments superstar Peter Lynch, who ran the now-$16.7 billion Magellan Fund when it sat atop the fund world with strong performance and rapid growth.
"
2014,CELG,"Putnam Investors Fund assets peaked at $16.2 billion in August 2000 and shrank to a low of $1.2 billion by September 2011. Assets have been rising since then.
"
2015,CELG,"Sullivan, who is 54 years old, spoke with IBD from his office in Boston's financial district about how he invests.
"
2016,CELG,"IBD: Is it OK if I mention that you have a distinct Brooklyn accent?
"
2017,CELG,"Sullivan: I was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Long Island. My dad grew up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. I grew up a New York Mets fan because the Dodgers had just moved to L.A. We hate the Yankees. I would relish your mentioning my accent.
"
2018,CELG,"IBD: You have a flexible style, right? You invest in both growth and value stocks.
"
2019,CELG,"Sullivan: I'm the core manager here at Putnam. Investors Fund is a mix of value and growth. So is my Multi-Cap Core Fund (with $109 million in assets), which is four years old. It's the same style, but even more flexible, because it can go up and down the market-cap spectrum. Investors Fund must have at least 75% of its securities in large caps. Multi-Cap cannot have more than 75% in any one category — large, mid or small cap. Stylewise, they're the same.
"
2020,CELG,"IBD: And what are the three types of stocks that Investors Fund buys?
"
2021,CELG,"Sullivan: I call the first bucket my legacy stocks. They're large caps that I researched earlier in my career or even recently. It was in-depth research. Then I gave each one three minutes of research every week for five, 10, 30 years. I refined my understanding of what factors move each stock up or down. That helps me understand when to make a move. It's my most boring bucket but the most important to me.
"
2022,CELG,"The second bucket has to do with smart money. The main factor is insider buying. I follow that closely and have for many years.
"
2023,CELG,"In the early to mid-1980s, when I worked for Peter Lynch, it was the No. 1 factor that he deferred to when looking for the right timing to buy a stock.
"
2024,CELG,"IBD: What was your role at Fidelity?
"
2025,CELG,"Sullivan: In 1985, I was doing research on European chemical stocks like BASF, Imperial Chemical and (Holland's) Akzo Nobel. Big stocks. It was important for Magellan to look for big, liquid stocks.
"
2026,CELG,"It was also much harder to follow insider transactions. You had to check SEC filings on paper. And they could be six to eight weeks old. The rules were looser about when insiders had to file.
"
2027,CELG,"Sarbanes-Oxley moved it to a 48-hour rule. And now you can watch the information flow in on the Internet in real time.
"
2028,CELG,"It doesn't tell me what to buy, but it gives me ideas.
"
2029,CELG,"The third bucket is special situations. One of the most common are follow-on stock offerings. They used to be called secondary offerings. It might be filed at 4 o'clock on a typical day. XYZ company is doing a follow-on. And you've got 45 minutes to decide if you want to play it or not. They'd file at 4:15 and close their books at 5 p.m.
"
2030,CELG,"IBD: What's a recent one you did?
"
2031,CELG,"Sullivan: The latest was HD Supply (HDS), which was part of Home Depot (HD). (Former CEO) Bob Nardelli started building a distributor of big equipment. They IPO'd it after he left. I bought on the IPO, and they did a secondary offering. I put in offers below the asking price.
"
2032,CELG,"IBD: How often does that work?
"
2033,CELG,"Sullivan: CDW (CDW) is a technology distributor. They sell to midsize companies that don't have big IT departments. They went public last year. Please specify that I still own it but I sold a lot of it.
"
2034,CELG,"I was maybe the first institutional investor to meet with them. They were never fast-growing. The underwriter was asking 22, maybe 24. I said, ""I want to buy a lot at 18."" The underwriter said, ""Maybe you missed the (detail) that we're selling at 24."" I said, ""No, I didn't miss it. I like it at 18, not 24."" At 18 it was trading at 12 times earnings. At 18 times earnings it's not warranted.
"
2035,CELG,"Anyway, they went on a road show, had difficulty getting an audience because a lot of guys thought it was overpriced. After two weeks, they came back and said 18 would work. I said, ""OK, but now I only want it at 17."" They went public at 17. Since then, they've met their meager expectations. As they did, they grabbed a larger audience (of investors). The stock has slowly migrated to 30-ish. That's a great special situation.
"
2036,CELG,"IBD: You like to buy stocks on price weakness. Give me an example, please.
"
2037,CELG,"Sullivan: Buying on weakness was an old Peter Lynch rule.
"
2038,CELG,"I bought Southwest Airlines (LUV) two, 2-1/2 years ago, when it was (trading around 8 or 9).
"
2039,CELG,"The rest of the airlines were doing well. They charge for everything. But Southwest didn't, so it got depressed. It was selling below the replacement costs of all their airplanes. I figured it had to climb. And they could always start charging (for individual services like baggage). I loaded up as much as I could. It's gone to around 34.
"
2040,CELG,"IBD: You've added to your Apple (AAPL) stake. Why?
"
2041,CELG,"Sullivan: I started buying Apple again in the June quarter. It had pulled back from its highs. I took it to my biggest position.
"
2042,CELG,"A year and a half or two years ago, both Apple and Google (GOOGL) went to 700. Then they separated. Apple pulled back. Google shot up. When everyone fell in love with Google, I used it as a source of funds. Apple had hair on it because it hadn't come out with anything new. Now it's coming through again. But it's not expensive on earnings. It's a quasi-value name with meaningful growth.
"
2043,CELG,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is trending up again. Did investors decide this biotech was oversold?
"
2044,CELG,"Sullivan: This was one of several large biotechs that I started positioning in more than three years ago. They looked like value names with growth. Now their pipelines are still meaningful. They've got good top- and bottom-line growth. Big pharmaceutical firms don't have that. And on a P-E-to-growth basis, it's still attractive. It's been stronger since the (Q1) sell-off than some biotechs like Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). I added to Celgene during the weakness (earlier in) the year.
"
2045,CELG,"IBD: Facebook (FB) has had a nice run-up since mid-2013. Is it still attractive?
"
2046,CELG,"Sullivan: I'm underweight now. (My weighting is) less than 50 basis points. It's had a good move. It's the place where the eyeballs are. They were slow to get their mobile application to work. But they've done that. It's still a growth story. But it's trading at 40 times next year's (estimated) earnings, so at this point I'm neutral. I don't want to (make my position) bigger unless the stock pulls back.
"
2047,CELG,"IBD: What's your thesis for CBRE Group (CBG)?
"
2048,CELG,"Sullivan: They're a play on a commercial real estate rebound. They're not expensive.
"
2049,CELG,"They're big brokers, maybe the biggest. They manage big office buildings. It's been a dead area, but it's coming back. Nonresidential construction is coming back, and occupancy rates are getting better. We've got them earning $1.70 (per share) this year and $1.80 next year. They're not a fancy name. They're a bit of a sleeper.
"
2050,CELG,"IBD: Gilead's earnings per share growth has exploded. Is Sovaldi, its hepatitis C treatment, the entire story?
"
2051,CELG,"Sullivan: The real attraction is more than that. They've got drugs for liver and heart disease. And a good platform for AIDS. But the real nice thing is that this stock is inexpensive on earnings. They're expected to earn $8 a share this year and $9.50 next year.
"
2052,CELG,"That's very attractive: 11-1/2 times next year's earnings on a company growing in the teens. And we're fans of their whole pipeline.
"
2053,CELG,"IBD: Is Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) driver its no-frills approach?
"
2054,CELG,"Sullivan: Yes, their no-frills approach is their key.
"
2055,CELG,"The interesting thing is that they're not targeted as competition by larger airlines, which is important. It avoids a price war.
"
2056,CELG,"The larger airlines see them as an ultralow-cost carrier. When they go into a new market, they actually expand the market. Big competitors see that. They get people to fly who don't normally: college students, people on tight budgets, people who don't mind flying at midnight, people who don't mind being charged for extra bags or maybe overhead compartments.
"
2057,CELG,"When will the airlines go after each other to get market share? They're not doing it now. The old managements (that engaged in price wars) have disappeared. Airline bankruptcies are fresh in (airlines managers') heads.
"
2058,CELG,"IBD: Where is railcar-maker Trinity Industries (TRN) in its economic cycle?
"
2059,CELG,"Sullivan: Its cycle still continues to work. We're only halfway through.
"
2060,CELG,"They make all kinds of railroad cars. One of the most interesting on margin is cars that carry sand for fracking. The typical well takes 75 to 80 rail cars of this stuff.
"
2061,CELG,"Trinity is one of the few players in this business. The stock is not expensive.The $1.8 billion Putnam Investors Fund is an old geezer.

2078,CELG,"Halozyme Therapeutics has been one of 2015's hotter biotech stocks, but it's not exactly because of developing a drug. Halozyme's (HALO) one marketed product, Hylenex, aids in the delivery of injectable drugs.
"
2079,CELG,"Halozyme has also licensed Enhanze for the same purpose to such drug companies as Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen division, AbbVie (ABBV) and Baxalta (BXLT) for the development of injectable products.
"
2080,CELG,"San Diego-based Halozyme is also testing a product called PEGPH20 in combination with other drugs as a treatment for various cancers.
"
2081,CELG,"Analysts don't expect these efforts to yield steady annual earnings until 2017, but even after the recent biotech stock selloff, Halozyme is trading at double where it was at the start of the year.
"
2082,CELG,"In a recent interview with IBD, Halozyme CEO Helen Torley explained the company's business model and why it's catching Wall Street's attention.
"
2083,CELG,"IBD: You have two drug-delivery products, Hylenex and Enhanze, that seem similar. What is the difference between them?
"
2084,CELG,"Torley: Our one marketed product is Hylenex, and that is the basic rHuPH20 enzyme which degrades hyaluronan, which is a sugar that is present under your skin. If you've ever had a subcutaneous injection, as they're injecting it you probably get sore because they're coming up against some resistance. That resistance is caused by the hyaluronan that's under the skin.
"
2085,CELG,"Our product, which is rHuPH20, in Hylenex and also in Enhanze, temporarily breaks down the hyaluronan, which releases the water molecules that are attached to the hyaluronan, and allows the creation of passages underneath the skin that allow whatever you're injecting there to have a bigger surface area for absorption into the bloodstream or the lymphatics.
"
2086,CELG,"Hylenex is the product that Halozyme went and got approved, and it's promoted by a small field force that we have in the U.S.
"
2087,CELG,"It basically is the rHuPH20 that is used for the dispersion of fluids that can be given under the skin and also with some drugs as well. That is a modest part of our business in terms of generating some revenue.
"
2088,CELG,"Now we also have the part of the business that we call the Enhanze platform. And that's where we allow partners like Pfizer, Roche, Janssen, AbbVie and Baxalta to license the use of our enzyme, which, in most of those cases, they combine with their molecule.
"
2089,CELG,"I'll use Roche's Herceptin and MabThera (Rituxan in the U.S.) as two examples. They created a new product that was a mixture of Herceptin and our enzyme, and went through a different regulatory path to get approved. So when that new product, which is called Herceptin SC, is injected, our enzyme works to allow the herceptin to be absorbed underneath the skin because it's breaking down that hyaluronan barrier and allowing there to be a bigger surface area for absorption. So instead of Herceptin having to be given into the vein, as an IV, when it's co-administered with our drug you can give it as a subcutaneous injection.
"
2090,CELG,"It's the same base sugar. It's just that when it's licensed, it's called Enhanze, and when it's our product, it's called Hylenex.
"
2091,CELG,"IBD: And the drug you're developing for cancer treatment is also based on the same substance?
"
2092,CELG,"Torley: When we give Hylenex in the marketplace today, we give it subcutaneously. If we were to give it into the vein, it would be digested in the liver very rapidly. So it wouldn't have a big effect if it were given into the vein.
"
2093,CELG,"(So) we pegylated it. (Pegylating) is a not-uncommon approach taken to have drugs have a longer time that they can circulate in your body before they get digested and degraded by the liver. The PEGPH20 is basically a pegylated version of the rHuPH20 enzyme. We can give it into the vein and it will last in the body for several days, so it can exert its effects for several days.
"
2094,CELG,"Some examples would be Amgen's (AMGN) Neupogen, which is given pretty frequently for patients who have low white (blood) cells from receiving chemotherapy. They peglyated it and created Neulasta, which only had to be injected every couple of weeks, which was obviously a better convenience for patients.
"
2095,CELG,"That's exactly what we're trying to do here: have the drug last longer so it doesn't have to be given as frequently.
"
2096,CELG,"IBD: So is it necessarily combined with another drug, or does it do anything by itself?
"
2097,CELG,"Torley: PEGPH20 has some modest anti-cancer effect. But for the type of effects that we believe are important for patients, it needs to be used with another therapy.
"
2098,CELG,"I'll give an example of the data we just presented in late May, a study of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. These are patients who generally have a life expectancy of about six months after they're diagnosed.
"
2099,CELG,"We are looking at PEGPH20 in addition to one of the current best-available therapies, which is a combination of Abraxane, Celgene's (CELG) drug, and gemcitabine, which is a generic drug. What we did was look at PEGPH20 on top of Abraxane and gemcitabine vs. Abraxane and gemcitabine alone.
"
2100,CELG,"The theory as to why PEGPH20 is working is that for patients who are at a high level of this sugar hyaluronan in and around their tumor, it acts as a barrier to the cancer therapies' ability to get to the tumor where they need to work. And it does that by binding water molecules, creating high pressure in and around the tumor that compresses the blood vessels, so that when you get an injection of Abraxane, for example, the theory is the Abraxane cannot get into the tumor where it needs to work because there's low blood flow in the tumor.
"
2101,CELG,"We administer our PEG0H20, it breaks down the hyaluronan, opens up the blood vessels, opens up the blood flow. And so if after you give PEGPH20 you give Abraxane and gemcitabine, there's a much higher concentration of the chemotherapies that get into the tumor where they need to work.
"
2102,CELG,"Early data from our phase two study (showed) patients who received PEGPH20 before they got the gemcitabine and Abraxane had a doubling of their progression-free survival (and) a doubling of their response rate, and we saw an interesting early trend toward an improvement in survival — in the patients who had high levels of hyaluronan. (We) estimate that about 40% to 60% of pancreatic-cancer patients have high levels of this sugar.
"
2103,CELG,"Today with Abraxane and gemcitabine, which is one of the best standards of care, the median survival is just about eight months. What we're hoping to do for these patients of high levels of hyaluronan is to get a good improvement over and above that.

2106,CELG,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance Report
"
2107,CELG,"Sophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
2108,CELG,"This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.
"
2109,CELG,"Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.
"
2110,CELG,"The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.
"
2111,CELG,"Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.
"
2112,CELG,"IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?
"
2113,CELG,"Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.
"
2114,CELG,"IBD: How does each segment differ?
"
2115,CELG,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.
"
2116,CELG,"The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.
"
2117,CELG,"The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:
"
2118,CELG,"First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.
"
2119,CELG,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
2120,CELG,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
2121,CELG,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
2122,CELG,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
2123,CELG,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
2124,CELG,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
2125,CELG,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
2126,CELG,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
2127,CELG,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
2128,CELG,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
2129,CELG,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
2130,CELG,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
2131,CELG,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
2132,CELG,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
2133,CELG,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
2134,CELG,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
2135,CELG,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
2136,CELG,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
2137,CELG,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
2138,CELG,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
2139,CELG,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
2140,CELG,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.
"
2141,CELG,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.
"
2142,CELG,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.
"
2143,CELG,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
2144,CELG,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
2145,CELG,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
2146,CELG,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
2147,CELG,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
2148,CELG,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
2149,CELG,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
2150,CELG,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
2151,CELG,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
2152,CELG,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
2153,CELG,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
2154,CELG,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
2155,CELG,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
2156,CELG,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
2157,CELG,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
2158,CELG,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
2159,CELG,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.
"
2160,CELG,"A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.
"
2161,CELG,"Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.
"
2162,CELG,"IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?
"
2163,CELG,"Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.
"
2164,CELG,"Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.
"
2165,CELG,"Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).
"
2166,CELG,"They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).
"
2167,CELG,"Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.
"
2168,CELG,"There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.
"
2169,CELG,"And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.
"
2170,CELG,"IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?
"
2171,CELG,"Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.
"
2172,CELG,"Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.
"
2173,CELG,"IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?
"
2174,CELG,"Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.
"
2175,CELG,"They've got a powerful pipeline.
"
2176,CELG,"IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?
"
2177,CELG,"Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.
"
2178,CELG,"They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.
"
2179,CELG,"Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance ReportSophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T.

The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.IBD: What's your Visa thesis?Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.They've got a powerful pipeline.IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.

First developed in academic labs, CAR-T therapies have been picked up by big pharma Novartis (NVS) as well as a number of small startups.
"
2309,CELG,"Kite Pharma (KITE), Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Bellicum Pharmaceuticals (BLCM) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) are CAR-T stocks that have come public in the last two years.

"
2310,CELG,"Kite Partners With Amgen
"
2311,CELG,"Bluebird partnered with Celgene (CELG) to develop CAR-T therapies before it went public. Kite this month made a deal with Amgen (AMGN) worth as much as $585 million, sending the stock to a new high.
"
2312,CELG,"So what is this technology that's got everyone so excited? As with other forms of immunotherapy, it aims to overcome the ways that cancer cells fool the immune system into passing them by without realizing they're threats.
"
2313,CELG,"The T cells are immune cells in the blood that normally attack intruders. They can be genetically engineered to produce receptors to an antigen specific to tumor cells, allowing them to recognize the enemy.
"
2314,CELG,"What makes this different from other immunotherapies such as PD-1 inhibitors is the method of producing the treatment. It's actually a form of cell therapy, which involves harvesting the patient's own cells — T cells, in this case — engineering them with CARs, multiplying them in the lab, and then injecting them back into the patient. Thus what the company develops isn't a drug per se, but the specific type of CAR.
"
2315,CELG,"There are a number of different possible antigens to target, but the one getting the most attention these days is CD19. That's an antigen that appears on B-cell malignancies, which cause several different kinds of blood cancer. While research is still in the early stages, some very intriguing results started coming out last year.
"
2316,CELG,"Novartis CAR-T Advances
"
2317,CELG,"In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October, Novartis and its partner, the University of Pennsylvania, reported that 27 out of 30 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) showed complete remission after treatment with their CAR-T cells, CTL019.
"
2318,CELG,"At the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference in early December, a different CTL019 study reported that 36 of 39 children had been rid of ALL. Even tinier studies also pointed to promise in other blood cancers, follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma.
"
2319,CELG,"At the same conference, researchers at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center presented data from phase one studies on two CD19-targeting candidates they developed with Juno. Again, ALL stood out as the target disease: it disappeared from more than 80% of patients in both adult and pedatric studies.
"
2320,CELG,"""People have described (the results) as stunning and remarkable,"" Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville told IBD. ""They're just phenomenal results in very tough hematological cancers.""
"
2321,CELG,"Quenneville added that another reason for the upturn in optimism is greater confidence that doctors can manage CAR-T therapy's most alarming side effect, cytokine-release syndrome. Cytokines are chemical messengers produced by T cells which, when suddenly released en masse via a big T-cell infusion, can bring on high fever and a drop in blood pressure. In fact, in an earlier study two patients died of this syndrome. However, since then physicians have figured out that they can manage this problem with strong anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Amgen's Enbrel.
"
2322,CELG,"Can CAR-T Work On Tumors?
"
2323,CELG,"Still, there are a great many unknowns given the early stages of testing going on — Novartis is farthest along with phase two studies, while others range from phase one to preclinical. This is especially important because what really matters in cancer is the duration of the response — especially if the companies go beyond blood and into solid tumors, which make up the majority of cancers.
"
2324,CELG,"""In solid tumors, metastases often reside in different tissues and at different sites,"" wrote Leerink analyst Howard Liang in his Jan. 13 initiation report on Juno. ""CAR-T cells will have to engage the initial tumor, expand, and circulate throughout the body to find these metastases. Without adequate persistence, these cells may not live long enough to accomplish this.""
"
2325,CELG,"Another great unknown hanging over the industry is price. This is basically what sank the only cell therapy so far to hit the market: Dendreon's Provenge. These personalized therapies are expensive to produce, and Provenge's degree of superiority to other treatments was deemed by many to be too low to justify its $93,000 price tag.
"
2326,CELG,"Normally drug companies don't talk about price this early in the game, so many were surprised when Kite CFO Cynthia Butitta said at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference this month that she expects the treatment to cost $150,000. She said the company plans to start talking with insurers about reimbursement this year.
"
2327,CELG,"However, if and when Kite's product comes to market, it might well not be Kite anymore. Quenneville says another factor driving these stocks is that CAR-T may well provide the next hunting ground for big acquirers.

2474,CELG,"Selecting stocks that have superior profit and sales growth is not the sole key to success in the market. Neither is simply buying stocks with outstanding price strength.Before you invest in a stock, make sure that it also is a favorite among the biggest investors in the market: mutual funds, investment advisors, banks and the like. This critical component is known as institutional sponsorship.Proof of heavy institutional buying is one way to confirm sponsorship, but is time-consuming to find — except at IBD.The paper's Mutual Funds and ETFs section provides instruments to help. Many of the features do double duty. They reveal top-performing funds for long-term investors and help you zero in on stocks that these strong buyers have targeted.Mutual funds are, by design, a more passive investing tool than stocks. Professional fund managers and research crews pick and time the purchases of stocks so that fund clients don't have to sweat the details.IBD narrows down the field to a list of 40 leading funds whose stock holdings carry a high average IBD Composite Rating and which have tended to outperform the S&P 500 since the index's 2009 low.The Growth Funds Leading The Market feature on the mutual funds page spotlights two of those funds each day. As is often the case in IBD, the feature makes it worth pulling out the reading glasses and diving into the fine print. The box provides a basic bio on the funds, a volatility rating and the average EPS and Relative Price Strength ratings of its stock holdings.Perhaps even more importantly, the box provides the fund's 10 largest holdings, as well as its top new buys and top sells. The daily section also provides lists of other top-performing funds, screened according to various criteria.You can delve even deeper with IBD's Mutual Fund Monthly and Quarterly Reports, usually published in the first week of each month. These features slice and dice the top-performing funds according to size, sector and type of investment. Such vital signs point to warming or cooling movement across the global economy and offer clues for whether you might want to tinker with your fund portfolio.From a stock-buying perspective, the monthly and quarterly data on stock buys and sells are pure gold mines. These data tables put a radio collar on smart money over the prior three months. Which stocks were the top funds buying, and how much?The ""Top Funds' Latest Sells"" table provides the number of funds buying vs. those selling, with a net total of sellers. If you spot one of your stocks on this list, closely monitor its chart for any key sell signals.On the buy side, some stock names will be familiar from the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 or Your Weekly Review. The table lists the industry group name and several key IBD ratings. It details how many funds are buying and the total amount invested.The IBD Mutual Fund Monthly special published on May 7 listed Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) and Zebra Techologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) as ones into which top funds poured the most dollars in the most recent three months.

He added that the new revenue guidance agrees with analysts' estimates.Perhaps for that reason, Gilead stock fell fractionally late, largely erasing a 1% regular-session gain.Gilead's other major drugs — HIV medicines Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Complera and Stribild — modestly topped consensus, except for Atripla.In its budding field of cancer medicine, Gilead also said the FDA approved its drug idelalisib, now branded Zydelig, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Analysts expect this to be a blockbuster of more modest proportions than Sovaldi, with sales peaking at $1.5 billion in 2020.Two other major biotechs report on Thursday: Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene (CELG).
"
2576,CELG,"Big-cap biotech Biogen Idec (BIIB) soundly beat analysts' Q2 expectations and substantially raised its guidance early Wednesday, sending shares up more than 11% in midday trading in the stock market today to near 338, a four-month high.Biogen's Q2 earnings rose 52% over the year-earlier quarter to $3.49 a share, topping analysts' consensus by 66 cents. Sales increased 40% to $2.4 billion vs. the Street's $2.16 billion.The company increased its full-year guidance for revenue growth to 38%-41%, up from its earlier guide of 26%-28% and analysts' average of 28.5%. Its EPS guidance is now $12.90-$13.10, more than $1.50 above its previous guidance. Analysts were expecting $11.53.The upside came largely from Tecfidera, the oral multiple-sclerosis drug approved in the U.S. last year and in Europe in early February. Management and analysts had expected the European launch to be slow because Novartis (NVS) had gotten into the market first with its MS pill Gilenya. However, on the conference call to discuss results, executives said the uptake in the European countries where it has gained reimbursement (mainly Germany at this point) is proceeding at a similar pace to the U.S.Total sales of Tecfidera outside the U.S. in the quarter were $115 million vs. consensus of $75 million. Domestic sales also outperformed, with a take of $585 million topping estimates by $100 million.Q2 also benefited from a one-time event. During the quarter, Biogen came to an agreement with the Italian National Medicines Agency that eliminated that country's reimbursement limit on Tysabri, an older MS drug, retroactive to February 2013. The recognition of this revenue added 15 cents to Q2 EPS.Amid all the good news, two items disappointed analysts. One was that sales, general and administrative spending was guided higher than expected, at 22%-23% of revenue. On the call, CFO Paul Clancy said this was necessary because of the unprecedented amount of drug launching underway. Not only is Tecfidera still rolling out, but also in Q2 Biogen launched its long-acting hemophilia drug Alprolix (which also beat expectations, with $10 million in sales vs. analysts' $4 million estimate) and just last week launched its hemophilia A counterpart Eloctate. The company is also preparing to launch a new interferon-based MS drug, Plegridy. On the call, Biogen CEO George Scangos said he'd just gotten word that Plegridy has been approved in the EU.The other disappointment was a delay in reporting results from a key clinical trial. For months, the Street has been buzzing about a Biogen pipeline product called anti-LINGO, which could be the first disease-altering treatment for MS. Analysts had expected 12-month results from a phase two trial to be out next year, but management said it will wait until 2016 to report 18-month results.Nonetheless, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum was generally impressed, pointing out that this was the largest beat that Biogen had reported in 10 years.""Overall a really good call with no new disclosures that diluted the quality of the EPS/sales beat on the quarter,"" he wrote in an email to clients after the conference call.Biogen kicks off earnings for several top-rated biotechs. After Tuesday's market close, Gilead Sciences (GILD) is expected to report a 258% earnings per share on sales of its blockbuster Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene (CELG) are on tap for Thursday.In other biotech news, Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) shot up 287% to 228.10 after the company reported surprisingly strong Phase 3 trial results for its breast cancer drug.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.RELATED:Biogen Shares Rebound As Street Has A Change Of Heart.

"
2590,CELG,"How do you follow a legend?
"
2591,CELG,"That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.
"
2592,CELG,"Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.
"
2593,CELG,"Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.
"
2594,CELG,"Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.
"
2595,CELG,"The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.
"
2596,CELG,"Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.
"
2597,CELG,"IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?
"
2598,CELG,"Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.
"
2599,CELG,"IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.
"
2600,CELG,"Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.
"
2601,CELG,"IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?
"
2602,CELG,"Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.
"
2603,CELG,"IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?
"
2604,CELG,"Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.
"
2605,CELG,"We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.
"
2606,CELG,"IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?
"
2607,CELG,"Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.
"
2608,CELG,"IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?
"
2609,CELG,"Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.
"
2610,CELG,"IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?
"
2611,CELG,"Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.
"
2612,CELG,"IBD: What's your biggest bet?
"
2613,CELG,"Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.
"
2614,CELG,"IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?
"
2615,CELG,"Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.
"
2616,CELG,"He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.
"
2617,CELG,"We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.
"
2618,CELG,"Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.
"
2619,CELG,"IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?
"
2620,CELG,"Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.
"
2621,CELG,"IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?
"
2622,CELG,"Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.
"
2623,CELG,"I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)
"
2624,CELG,"People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.
"
2625,CELG,"But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.
"
2626,CELG,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?
"
2627,CELG,"Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.
"
2628,CELG,"I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).
"
2629,CELG,"IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?
"
2630,CELG,"Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.
"
2631,CELG,"What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.
"
2632,CELG,"IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?
"
2633,CELG,"Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.
"
2634,CELG,"They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.
"
2635,CELG,"And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.
"
2636,CELG,"We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.
"
2637,CELG,"IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?
"
2638,CELG,"Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.
"
2639,CELG,"We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.
"
2640,CELG,"IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?
"
2641,CELG,"Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.
"
2642,CELG,"IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?
"
2643,CELG,"Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.
"
2644,CELG,"I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.
"
2645,CELG,"And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.
"
2646,CELG,"IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?
"
2647,CELG,"Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.
"
2648,CELG,"IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?
"
2649,CELG,"Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.
"
2650,CELG,"They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.
"
2651,CELG,"IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?
"
2652,CELG,"Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.
"
2653,CELG,"IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?
"
2654,CELG,"Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.How do you follow a legend?That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012.

It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach.

We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see profit rising 27% to 75 cents a share.

Shares of the auto dealer tumbled 8% and sliced the line Thursday on a disappointing earnings report.Seagate Technology (STX) shaved early losses, but was still off by 1%.

2745,CELG,"Odd things sometimes happen, but odd things can't change the odds.In the 1946 World Series, Boston's future Hall of Famer Ted Williams batted a miserable .200, while Cardinals' journeyman Joe Garagiola batted a dazzling .316.Yet, based on that, no one would've bet that Garagiola would outperform Williams the following season. And he didn't: Garagiola hit .257 vs. Williams' .343.Quality doesn't lag for long.Investing is no different. You want to buy the breakouts of Ted Williams-quality stocks because they are likeliest to work.Certainly, some thinly traded stocks with middle-of-the-pack ratings can break out of bases and advance smartly. But you don't want to play those odds.There are many factors that tilt the odds for a stock, but today we'll look at just one — the Accumulation/Distribution Rating.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating appears on the IBD minichart and in the stock tables. The rating reflects a stock's institutional footprint.Accumulation points to institutional buying. Distribution suggests institutional selling.The formula that defines the rating is proprietary. It involves a moving average of price-and-volume data. After about 60 days, a day's action becomes irrelevant.The A or B ratings mean the stock has been under accumulation. The C rating is neutral. The D or E ratings mean the stock has been under distribution.No gauge is perfect, and two words in the above paragraph point to the imperfection. The words are ""has been."" There is no way of knowing if a stock will continue to be under accumulation after the breakout.Still, the rating is a valuable clue, even if it doesn't guarantee a breakout's success.Let's look at some breakouts and what the rating was before the stock broke out.We'll look at stocks that broke out on or after the July 11 follow-through day.The Accumulation/Distribution ratings are from the close the day before the breakout. (Sometimes a breakout will lift the rating sharply, but an investor has no way of knowing in advance.)The figures are from IBD's database.The chart above shows 11 stocks and their ratings on the eve of the breakout.Almost every stock showed accumulation, or at least neutrality, before the breakout.The exception was Celgene (CELG). The D- rating on July 10 pointed to institutional selling, but the stock gapped up 8% in double volume July 11. The stock advanced only 11% from that day's close before consolidating.Netflix (NFLX) had an A- rating before its July 12 breakout. On July 25, the stock fell 3.5% below a 248.95 buy point, then found traction. The stock gained 34% in less than three months.

2746,CELG,"Stocks continued higher and were on pace to finish with gains Tuesday for the first time in three sessions.The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.6% gain. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 0.4% and 0.2% respectively. Turnover was again tracking lower across the board in the stock market today.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) rose 3% as it bounced back from its recent slide. On Friday, the stock sliced its 50-day line in huge volume, marking a sell signal.Other leading biotechs and drugmakers were also rebounding from recent weakness. Spanish drugmaker Grifols (GRFS) rallied 3% and regained its 50-day line. Celgene (CELG) rose 2%, while Actavis (ACT) edged up 1%.Elsewhere, Avnet (AVT) added 2% to a record high in fast trade. It's now 4% past a 44.10 buy point from a cup-with-handle base cleared March 18. Despite market volatility, the stock has seen strong accumulation in recent sessions. The electronics component maker's sales growth accelerated in the latest two quarters.On the downside, G-III Apparel Group (GIII) was off its session low, but still down 3% in heavy trading. Shares were off by as much as 9% intraday after the company gave disappointing guidance on Q1 earnings and sales.
"
2747,CELG,"Buying a stock that has been beaten down sounds like a good idea, but it's actually very risky.In fact, it's often better to buy high and sell higher.Here's why: Stocks that fall well below their previous highs face a difficult road back. That's because current shareholders who are sitting on big losses tend to sell shares to break even or cut their losses if the stock rallies. This creates stiff resistance to further price gains, a concept that's known as overhead supply.Some especially strong stocks can rebound fast from a deep correction, as Apple (AAPL) and Priceline.com (PCLN) showed coming out of the financial crisis of 2008-09. But most stocks take much longer to reach an old high.Celgene (CELG) lost half its value during the financial crisis. That created a large pool of investors who were underwater and looking to sell once the stock got back to or near break-even.The stock rose when a new bull market began in March 2009. But after getting as high as 65.79 in March 2010 (1), Celgene traded mostly sideways for nearly two years. Each time the stock tried to climb above resistance near 63 to 65, it ran into sellers.It finally reclaimed its post-crisis high of 77.39 in March 2012 (2), two months after breaking out of a cup base two months earlier.Celgene had always been among the leaders in the highly rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. But it took a long time to exhaust its overhead supply of shares coming onto the market every time the stock started to show strength.It usually takes 18 months for the overhead supply to diminish, at which point those who still own the stock are probably in it for the long term and not likely to bail out at the old highs.Celgene continued to get back on track. After a final correction of 27% (3) from the April 2012 high of 80.42 — much less of a decline than during the 2008 crash — Celgene jumped out of a base-on-base pattern to a new high in January 2013.Celgene was added to IBD Leaderboard on Nov. 23, 2012, as the market confirmed a new uptrend. It more than doubled over the next year to a peak of 174.66.Strong fundamentals justified the move. From 2008 to 2013, Celgene's earnings grew from $1.56 a share to $5.96. Sales leaped nearly threefold, from $2.26 billion to $6.49 billion. Its EPS Rating is now 94 and the SMR (sales growth, profit margins and return on equity) grade is a top-notch A.For more powerful IBD content, exclusive stock lists & actionable investing tools — Take a complimentary 4 week trial to eIBD.

2757,CELG,"As IBD stock screens go, the IBD Big Cap 20 is of a different stripe.A primary focus on large-capitalization stocks distinguishes it from the high-growth slant of the IBD 50 or Your Weekly Review. But that doesn't mean that the IBD Big Cap 20, which runs in Tuesday's paper, won't find its fair share of winning stocks before they start big price advances.The Big Cap 20 is also featured in the eTables online product.Some big companies can still produce robust gains in earnings and share prices. A look back at some of the stocks that made the Big Cap 20 aptly illustrate that point (more on that later).To find the winners in this weekly feature, investors should follow a systematic approach.Start by studying the mini weekly charts that are published for each of the 20 stocks. Separate the ones that are forming bases or in secondary buy areas.Not sure how to spot them? You've got help. The bottom of each chart shows a brief analysis, written by IBD market writers, that tells readers if the stock is near a buy point or too far extended in price to be of immediate interest. In many cases, this analysis gives the correct buy point. Do not buy until the stock hits this buy point.For more analysis, read the Big Cap 20 column. Here, you can learn more about the stocks setting up in attractive chart zones, as well as which industry sectors are showing leadership among big caps.In June of last year, the stock market was struggling, yet top-rated stocks Google (GOOGL) and Biogen Idec (BIIB) formed bases during that time. Both also made the June 11 Big Cap 20 list.Google was finding support at its 10-week moving average. The chart analysis noted the action. Google continued a long consolidation and broke out on Oct. 18 in a powerful gap-up sparked by a solid earnings report.Shares surged 36% until peaking in February. Google's 21% EPS gain was smaller than what investors had seen from the Internet giant in its halcyon days. Yet it was in line with other Big Cap 20 firms; double-digit growth for large, mature companies denotes market leadership and strength.Biogen had found support and eventually formed a cup-with-handle base. The stock broke out Sept. 11; after a few pullbacks, it gained 53% by March this year.In the June 4, 2013, edition of the Big Cap 20, fellow biotech Celgene (CELG) was forming a base. After a July 11 breakout, it shot up 32% to its Jan. 13 peak of 174.66.

Volume was tracking lower in the stock market today, more so on the New York Stock Exchange.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Under Armour (UA) paced the IBD 50 as each rocketed 22% and 21% respectively following blowout earnings reports.Facebook jumped 14% to a new high after mobile ad revenue fueled better-than-expected Q4 results. Google (GOOG), meanwhile, gained 4% after getting support at its 10-week line for the first time since its October breakout. Earlier today, Google sold its Motorola Mobility hardware business to Lenova for $2.9 billion. Two years ago, Google paid just over $12 billion for the business.On the downside, Celgene (CELG) was among the few losers in the IBD 50.

The stock is testing resistance at its 200-day line but remains 19% off its 52-week higher.HomeAway (AWAY) rocketed in post-session trading after Expedia (EXPE) agreed to buy the online marketplace for vacation rentals for $3.9 billion. The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year pending regulatory approval, is expected to help Expedia compete against home-rental businesses such as Airbnb.Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) rose in after-hours trading following its Q3 earnings report. Profit for the period rose 33% to 57 cents a share on a 41% gain in revenue to $4.5 billion.

2788,CELG,"SAN FRANCISCO — Biotechs Celgene (CELG), Alnylam (ALNY) and Jazz (JAZZ), along with big pharma Merck, were all on the move Monday as drugmakers poured out news at a major investor conference.
"
2789,CELG,"At the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Celgene issued pre liminary 2013 results and revised its guidance upward. Executives said revenue totaled $6.5 billion, a bit above analysts' consensus and up about $1 billion from 2012. Earnings of $3.96 a share were 4 cents short of estimates, but the company said Q4 was hit by ""collaboration-related payments to partners"" to the tune of 10 cents a share. Celgene didn't specify which of its many collaborations was responsible for that.
"
2790,CELG,"But the guidance was what the Street was buzzing about going in. At last year's JPMorgan conference, Celgene electrified the crowd with bullish guidance all the way out to 2017, and it was widely expected to raise that at this year's event. And indeed, it did. It added at least $1 billion to its 2017 sales guidance, now $13 billion to $14 billion. Its EPS is guided at $15 that year; the company previously guided $13-$14.
"
2791,CELG,"2014 Guidance Cautious
"
2792,CELG,"The Street was already there on the profit side, though the revenue guide was above analysts' consensus of $12.5 billion. In the nearer term, the 2014 sales guidance of $7.5 billion was slightly above views, but the EPS range of $7-$7.20 fell short of analysts' $7.29.
"
2793,CELG,"Celgene shares briefly hit a record high, but reversed to close down 3% at 164.90.
"
2794,CELG,"At the presentation, Celgene CEO Bob Hugin emphasized that the guidance raise was entirely due to the operating momentum on Celgene's hematology franchise and did not include any revised estimates related to its pipeline or its budding oncology business.
"
2795,CELG,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said Celgene has a history of conservative guidance.
"
2796,CELG,"""Short term, the stock has already run up a lot and thus the one-day move that so many investors are asking (us about) is likely just a short-term trading dynamic on high expectations into the event,"" Yee wrote in a research note. ""Longer term, we see the stock going higher because we think investors want to own solid growth stories this year with upside potential, and it's difficult to find strong 20%-25% growth stories in large-cap health care.""
"
2797,CELG,"Yee downplayed the nearer-term EPS shortfall, noting the collaboration payments as well as likely heavy spending to launch Otezla (apremilast), expected to be approved for psoriasis this quarter. Hugin affirmed Celgene's guidance of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in Otezla sales by 2017, though analysts have long been skeptical of that number.

Genzyme already had such rights for Japan and Asia-Pacific. Alnylam closed 41% higher.
"
2801,CELG,"Alnylam CEO John Maraganore called the deal a ""game-changer"" and said that his company, which has no product sales, now has a balance sheet of around $1 billion. That will come in handy as Alnylam also agreed Sunday to pay $175 million up front, along with $105 million in milestone payments, for Sirna Therapeutics, a subsidiary of Merck (MRK).
"
2802,CELG,"Both companies focus on RNA interference (RNAi) technology to treat diseases genetically. Patisiran treats a rare disease called TTR-mediated amyloidosis, but the firm is also developing versions of the product to treat hemophilia, cardiomyopathy and high cholesterol.
"
2803,CELG,"Meanwhile, Merck said it has started the submission process on its candidate MK-3475 for advanced melanoma. MK-3475 is an anti-PD-1 antibody, a new class of cancer fighters that has inspired lofty sales estimates on Wall Street, and Merck's move was earlier than expected.
"
2804,CELG,"""While the news today in advanced melanoma is encouraging, the larger market opportunity for PD1/PDL1 antibodies is in lung cancer and other tumors,"" cautioned Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group. ""Also, bear in mind that Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) has demonstrated that the combination of its PD-1 and Yervoy may lead to better efficacy than PD-1 alone in melanoma — and BMY is considerably ahead of MRK in developing this combination.""

2831,CELG,"A strong year for the market in 2013 resulted in plenty of big moves by high-quality growth stocks. It's no surprise that their moves started the way they often do — by breaking out of bases in heavy volume soon after a market follow-through.The Nasdaq confirmed a new market uptrend just after Thanksgiving in 2012. In the weeks that followed, several growth stocks with top fundamentals emerged. LinkedIn (LNKD), Netflix (NFLX) and Lumber Liquidators (LL), profiled in this space in recent days, were early movers. So was Celgene (CELG), a longtime leader in the biotech industry.Why feature these companies now? You can learn a lot by studying winners.Celgene cleared a cup-with-handle pattern in early January, passing a buy point of 82.88. At the time, it was a mainstay in the IBD Big Cap 20 list of leading large-cap stocks. On Jan. 8, it was No. 1 on the list with a Composite Rating of 98 and an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A-. Fundamentals were solid and the stock was showing relative strength — two key ingredients of an emerging leader.The month of January had no shortage of positive headline flow for Celgene.On Jan. 7, the company offered bullish revenue guidance for 2013. CEO Robert Hugin forecast total product sales of more than $6 billion. He said revenue would double by 2017 thanks to several news drugs in development.The stock broke out of an eight-week base on July 11, then from a flat base in September. Those breakouts helped Celgene continue its advance.Celgene is best known for its blood cancer drug Revlimid. In June, the drug received additional approval from the Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.In the third quarter, Revlimid generated sales of $1.09 billion, up 12% from a year ago. It made up nearly two-thirds of total revenue.Another key drug for Celgene is Abraxane, used to treat lung and breast cancers. In September, the FDA also approved the drug to treat patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Third-quarter sales of Abrazane jumped 60% to $170 million.Apremilast is doing well in late-stage trials as treatment for patients with psoriatic arthritis.

2843,CELG,"When leading stocks fall, you need to read the situation impartially.
"
2844,CELG,"However, if you have a position in a top stock from a top group, emotions can cloud judgment.
"
2845,CELG,"You might sell in fear, or you might hold firm in stubbornness.
"
2846,CELG,"A drill is the best way to avoid subjective decisions. The drill doesn't change because you own the stock. The questions are what they are, and the answers are what they are.
"
2847,CELG,"Let's look at a recent example.
"
2848,CELG,"The biotech group began rising briskly in 2012 with a 40% gain for the year. Biotech stepped up the pace to 75% in 2013. The biotech group was up 36% for the year in late February, but by mid-April the gain was virtually gone.
"
2849,CELG,"As the pullback began, the time for a drill arrived. Here are some checkpoints:
"
2850,CELG,"• Length of run: IBD research shows that in general a leading stock's bullish run lasts about 18 to 24 months. The Medical-Biomedical/Biotech group was up for more than two years, so age was working against it. However, the group had two significant pullbacks along the way: an 18% drop in the fall of 2012 and a 16% decline in the fall of 2013.
"
2851,CELG,"• Group chart action: If you have access to MarketSmith, plug in the ticker for the biomedical group. (The ticker is G8063.) The action was tight and smooth through most of the run. However, after a 17% weekly gain in January, action became less confident. And the group chart showed railroad-tracks action in the week-ending March 7.
"
2852,CELG,"While railroad tracks on a group chart might not carry the same meaning as it would on a specific stock chart, it does reveal retracing action, which is not ideal.
"
2853,CELG,"• The RS line: A leader has to lead. It's a bad sign when the leaders in a group start to show fading RS lines. Celgene's (CELG) RS line began to flatten in October (1) and began to slide in late February (2). Celgene was the first top-rated biotech to show weakness.
"
2854,CELG,"• Growth rate: Is growth quickening or slowing? On Oct. 24 (3), Celgene reported Q3 earnings-per-share growth of 21% — its slowest growth in almost three years. In Q4, growth slowed further to 14%.
"
2855,CELG,"• Drop from screen: Celgene dropped from the IBD 50 on Feb. 3, returned Feb. 18 and was gone Feb. 24 (4). Other biomeds held on longer.

2912,CELG,"When evaluating stocks on your watch list, there's one word you need to know: volume.Volume — the number of shares traded — tells you whether mutual funds, pension funds and other deep-pocketed investors are buying or selling with passion. That's important because those institutions have the power to send a stock soaring to the sky, or plunging into the abyss.You want to buy stocks that are breaking out above buy points in volume that's at least 40% above normal. That's a sure sign of institutional support. But a stock that breaks out in lower volume is suspect. And a stock that falls in heavy volume may signal that big funds are bailing out.IBD tracks the volume movements of each stock everyday. ""The Stocks On The Move"" table, located in the Making Money section of IBD and on the home page at Investors.com, flags stocks that are moving in unusually heavy turnover.""You don't want to miss this screen if you are searching for emerging leaders,"" wrote IBD founder William J. O'Neil in his best-selling book, ""How To Make Money In Stocks.""He added: ""It's a good way to spot the breakout of a stock as it is happening or shortly thereafter.""Stocks on The Move can help you find stocks breaking out of bases or clearing secondary buy points, and point you to ones under accumulation.To make the table, stocks must be priced $20 or higher for the NYSE and $16 or higher for the Nasdaq. Stocks must have a price change of at least plus or minus 50 cents. And a stock's 50-day average volume must be above 60,000 shares.The criteria for stocks rising in price get more restrictive. They must have Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength Ratings of at least 70 and their Accumulation-Distribution Ratings must be D+ or higher. Last, a stock's next-year EPS estimate must be 15% or higher than its prior year's earnings.Stocks with EPS and RS Ratings of 80 or higher as well as being up in price for the day are boldfaced so you can quickly identify the market's best stocks.Celgene (CELG) appeared in the IBD website's Stocks On the Move table on Dec. 11, 2012 — the same day it broke out of a flat base with an 81.34 buy point. Volume was 121% above average that day, and the stock has gone on to rise more than 40%.Celgene had also appeared in Stocks On The Move on Dec. 5, giving investors a chance to add it to their watch lists while the biotech was still building its base.Not all stocks on this screen will go on to be winners.

The control group of patients had a survival rate of 51%, but the rate was 56% among those on Revlimid for 18 months and 59% for those on it for four years. The 18-month treatment also brought an average of 4.8 months in progression-free survival.

"
2932,CELG,"Big-cap biotechs Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene  (CELG) both beat third-quarter estimates and raised guidance Thursday, but their stocks headed in opposite directions.
"
2933,CELG,"Alexion rose 6.4%, with its shares coming from a comparatively soft Relative Strength Rating of 56. The company also announced that the Food and Drug Administration granted ""breakthrough therapy"" designation for its drug candidate Alxn1101, which is in early-stage testing to treat a rare genetic disease called molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A.
"
2934,CELG,"The FDA created the designation last year to help speed the approval of drugs that could bring a major improvement upon existing treatments for serious conditions. So far 22 other drugs have received it, including Alexion's asfotase alfa for another rare condition called hypophosphatasia.
"
2935,CELG,"Currently, however, Alexion's only other approved drug is Soliris, and it raked in $400.4 million in the third quarter. That's up 36% from the year-earlier quarter and about $5 million more than analysts' consensus. Profit, excluding one-time items, rose 38% to 83 cents a share, beating estimates by 4 cents.
"
2936,CELG,"Alexion also added about $10 million to its full-year sales guidance, now $1.535 billion to $1.54 billion vs. $1.13 billion last year. It also added a few cents to its EPS guidance, now $3.02 to $3.04.
"
2937,CELG,"On the conference call discussing results, CEO Leonard Bell credited the continued rollout of Soliris for its second disease indication. Since 2007 it's been sold as a treatment for an ultra-rare condition called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), but over the last couple years it's been picking up approvals for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), another very rare but serious condition.
"
2938,CELG,"On the call, Bell said U.S. patient uptake for aHUS is ramping faster than it did during the PNH rollout. The new indication is gaining traction in Europe and recently won approval in Japan.
"
2939,CELG,"Bell also said the company expects to file for approval of asfotase alpha in mid-2014, potentially ending Alexion's single-drug dependence.
"
2940,CELG,"Celgene's shares slid 1.3% to 157.96. It ranks No. 13 on the latest IBD 50, and on Monday hit an all-time high above 161.
"
2941,CELG,"Celgene said revenue rose 18% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.67 billion, about $30 million above consensus estimates. Profit rose 21% to $1.56 a share, beating estimates by 2 cents.
"
2942,CELG,"The company said full-year product sales are now expected to exceed the previously guided $6.2 billion, but didn't say by how much. Last year's sales totaled $5.51 billion. Celgene lifted and tightened its 2013 EPS range to $5.90-$5.95, but that was still a bit shy of analyst consensus of $5.98.
"
2943,CELG,"On a conference call to discuss results, JMP Securities analyst Michael King said guidance seemed conservative, given that the fourth quarter has traditionally been strong for Celgene.
"
2944,CELG,"Company Chief Financial Officer Jacqualyn Fouse said this year's Q4 is going to suffer from the entrance of a generic version of its Vidaza drug, a treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes (a group of bone-marrow diseases). She also said the firm is ramping up spending ahead of the expected launch of apremilast, a psoriasis treatment awaiting an FDA decision by the end of the first quarter.
"
2945,CELG,"Investors might also be put out that Celgene is pushing till next quarter the much-anticipated refiling of its lead drug Revlimid for a new indication in Europe, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research note Thursday.

2946,CELG,"Yee said it ""is not really clear"" why the delay but says the firm's 2017 guidance of $12 billion in sales and $13-$14 in EPS is still ""highly achievable.""Big-cap biotechs Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Celgene  (CELG) both beat third-quarter estimates and raised guidance Thursday, but their stocks headed in opposite directions.Alexion rose 6.4%, with its shares coming from a comparatively soft Relative Strength Rating of 56. The company also announced that the Food and Drug Administration granted ""breakthrough therapy"" designation for its drug candidate Alxn1101, which is in early-stage testing to treat a rare genetic disease called molybdenum cofactor deficiency type A.The FDA created the designation last year to help speed the approval of drugs that could bring a major improvement upon existing treatments for serious conditions. So far 22 other drugs have received it, including Alexion's asfotase alfa for another rare condition called hypophosphatasia.Currently, however, Alexion's only other approved drug is Soliris, and it raked in $400.4 million in the third quarter. That's up 36% from the year-earlier quarter and about $5 million more than analysts' consensus. Profit, excluding one-time items, rose 38% to 83 cents a share, beating estimates by 4 cents.Alexion also added about $10 million to its full-year sales guidance, now $1.535 billion to $1.54 billion vs. $1.13 billion last year. It also added a few cents to its EPS guidance, now $3.02 to $3.04.On the conference call discussing results, CEO Leonard Bell credited the continued rollout of Soliris for its second disease indication. Since 2007 it's been sold as a treatment for an ultra-rare condition called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), but over the last couple years it's been picking up approvals for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), another very rare but serious condition.On the call, Bell said U.S. patient uptake for aHUS is ramping faster than it did during the PNH rollout. The new indication is gaining traction in Europe and recently won approval in Japan.Bell also said the company expects to file for approval of asfotase alpha in mid-2014, potentially ending Alexion's single-drug dependence.Celgene's shares slid 1.3% to 157.96. It ranks No. 13 on the latest IBD 50, and on Monday hit an all-time high above 161.Celgene said revenue rose 18% over the year-earlier quarter to $1.67 billion, about $30 million above consensus estimates. Profit rose 21% to $1.56 a share, beating estimates by 2 cents.The company said full-year product sales are now expected to exceed the previously guided $6.2 billion, but didn't say by how much. Last year's sales totaled $5.51 billion. Celgene lifted and tightened its 2013 EPS range to $5.90-$5.95, but that was still a bit shy of analyst consensus of $5.98.On a conference call to discuss results, JMP Securities analyst Michael King said guidance seemed conservative, given that the fourth quarter has traditionally been strong for Celgene.Company Chief Financial Officer Jacqualyn Fouse said this year's Q4 is going to suffer from the entrance of a generic version of its Vidaza drug, a treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes (a group of bone-marrow diseases). She also said the firm is ramping up spending ahead of the expected launch of apremilast, a psoriasis treatment awaiting an FDA decision by the end of the first quarter.Investors might also be put out that Celgene is pushing till next quarter the much-anticipated refiling of its lead drug Revlimid for a new indication in Europe, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research note Thursday. It's approved only as a relapse treatment for the blood cancer multiple myeloma, but the company aims to get it approved as a front-line treatment.Yee said it ""is not really clear"" why the delay but says the firm's 2017 guidance of $12 billion in sales and $13-$14 in EPS is still ""highly achievable.""

2959,CELG,"The 50-day line is shaping up as a battlefield for many Big Cap 20 stocks.Ideally, a stock's trip back to its 50-day line, or 10-week line as some prefer, should be in quiet volume. If the stock bounces off the line in fast trade, then a secondary buy zone can be established.In some instances, an entry at the 50-day line can be an early buy in what eventually becomes a base.For example, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which was No. 9 in the Big Cap 20 on Dec. 10, returned to its 50-day line in mid-December. Volume was quiet on the descent.On Dec. 20, the stock bounced off the line in twice its usual volume. Investors could have bought anywhere from 516 to 533 that day.Chipotle consolidated for about three weeks after its bounce off the line — completing a cup-with-handle base. The entry was 537.10.Although a Jan. 9 breakout came in volume 65% above average, the stock never found further traction. The breakout failed.Investors who bought on the 50-day bounce might have eventually exited the trade with a small profit. Those who bought at the breakout lost money.The point here isn't that the 50-day line is preferable to a breakout. But the case does illustrate that the key area can sometimes give the investor one more tool in how to play a stock.A number of stocks on Monday's preliminary list for the Big Cap 20 are battling at the 50-day line.Facebook (FB) retreated to its 50-day line over four sessions. The first three days involved losses in below-average volume. On Monday, volume picked up, and the stock bounced up after touching the line. At its nadir, the stock fell almost 6% below its 54.93 buy point.Priceline (PCLN) made a 52-week high last week and then pulled back. On Monday, Priceline sliced under the 50-day line in heavy volume.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) retreated to the 50-day line in above-average volume. However, on Monday the stock rebounded off the line in strong volume.Celgene (CELG) broke under its 50-day line in fast trade Friday and lost more ground Monday.Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) is back at the 50-day line, but hasn't made a decisive move above or below the line.Google (GOOG) made a decent move up off the 50-day line Monday, after briefly violating the line. Volume was strong.Netflix (NFLX) closed under its 50-day line for 11 straight sessions and then gapped above the line in big volume Thursday. The stock recrossed a 368.75 buy point and is in a buy zone up to 387.19.A softening market could define the outcome of these battles at the 50-day line. However, should the Federal Reserve deliver a surprise Wednesday when its two-day meeting concludes, that could become the deciding factor.

"
2981,CELG,"Despite the strong performance of biotech ETFs in the past three years and the recent market pullback, there may still be room to run for investors who can stomach the sector's high volatility.
"
2982,CELG,"Of course, a lot will depend on the stock market's general direction. Both it and the biotech ETFs continued selling off Monday. Further progress in biotech ETFs might have to wait for a market uptrend to return.
"
2983,CELG,"But Steven Silver, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, says the industry's success is based on three pillars.
"
2984,CELG,"First, ""there's been a very solid period of both late-stage data and new drugs coming to the market,"" he said. ""All put together, I think there are a lot of pockets of significant progress.""
"
2985,CELG,"The second pillar, as he states, is a much more accommodative Food and Drug Administration that is focusing on getting more drugs to the market. Last year, the FDA started the Breakthrough Therapy Designation, providing a fast track for the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.
"
2986,CELG,"There are 35 to 40 programs that have received this designation so far. ""The FDA is only granting one out of every three programs with this designation, so I think over the long term it will be a really big deal if a company is to receive that designation in terms of getting the drug to market faster.""
"
2987,CELG,"Finally, the sector has a prospect of increased M&A activity. While traditionally the big pharmas were the acquirers of smaller biotechs, some biotechs have grown so large that they are now in the market to buy out smaller firms. This creates more competition in the market for the acquisition of those firms.
"
2988,CELG,"The two biggest biotech ETFs are iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI). Both are very liquid and have reasonable expense ratios, 0.48% of assets for IBB and 0.35% for XBI.
"
2989,CELG,"But their compositions are somewhat different. IBB holds 123 Nasdaq-listed stocks and is a market-cap weighted ETF. It is more diversified, with biotech accounting for 76% of the fund, pharma 17% and life sciences 7%.
"
2990,CELG,"Because it is market-cap weighted, its top five holdings are large independent biotechs: Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen Idec (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), each at 6% or 7% of the fund.
"
2991,CELG,"By comparison, XBI is made up of 69 stocks, nearly all biotechs. Its top five holdings are Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX), Sangamo BioSciences (SGMO) and Novavax (NVAX). The fund is equal-weighted, resulting in a bias toward smaller names, meaning more volatility and higher turnover.
"
2992,CELG,"Old School Vs. New School
"
2993,CELG,"""They are very different funds,"" said Robert Goldsborough, ETF analyst at Morningstar. In XBI, ""you're going to have more early-stage biotech firms. A lot of these are publicly traded companies, but they have no drug on the market yet and have no profits.""
"
2994,CELG,"XBI is up more this year but IBB has performed better over longer periods, with an average annual 38% vs. 23% in the past three years and 29% vs. 23% for five years.
"
2995,CELG,"""IBB actually has better risk-adjusted returns over the long term,"" said Goldsborough.

2996,CELG,"""I think that these stocks have done very, very well based on improving growth potential, rather than investors bidding up these companies just because,"" said Silver. ""It's been an exciting time, but I do think that it will continue to be an exciting time.""Despite the strong performance of biotech ETFs in the past three years and the recent market pullback, there may still be room to run for investors who can stomach the sector's high volatility.Of course, a lot will depend on the stock market's general direction. Both it and the biotech ETFs continued selling off Monday. Further progress in biotech ETFs might have to wait for a market uptrend to return.But Steven Silver, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, says the industry's success is based on three pillars.First, ""there's been a very solid period of both late-stage data and new drugs coming to the market,"" he said. ""All put together, I think there are a lot of pockets of significant progress.""The second pillar, as he states, is a much more accommodative Food and Drug Administration that is focusing on getting more drugs to the market. Last year, the FDA started the Breakthrough Therapy Designation, providing a fast track for the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.There are 35 to 40 programs that have received this designation so far. ""The FDA is only granting one out of every three programs with this designation, so I think over the long term it will be a really big deal if a company is to receive that designation in terms of getting the drug to market faster.""Finally, the sector has a prospect of increased M&A activity. While traditionally the big pharmas were the acquirers of smaller biotechs, some biotechs have grown so large that they are now in the market to buy out smaller firms. This creates more competition in the market for the acquisition of those firms.The two biggest biotech ETFs are iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI). Both are very liquid and have reasonable expense ratios, 0.48% of assets for IBB and 0.35% for XBI.But their compositions are somewhat different. IBB holds 123 Nasdaq-listed stocks and is a market-cap weighted ETF. It is more diversified, with biotech accounting for 76% of the fund, pharma 17% and life sciences 7%.Because it is market-cap weighted, its top five holdings are large independent biotechs: Gilead Sciences (GILD), Biogen Idec (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), each at 6% or 7% of the fund.By comparison, XBI is made up of 69 stocks, nearly all biotechs. Its top five holdings are Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT), Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX), Sangamo BioSciences (SGMO) and Novavax (NVAX). The fund is equal-weighted, resulting in a bias toward smaller names, meaning more volatility and higher turnover.Old School Vs. New School""They are very different funds,"" said Robert Goldsborough, ETF analyst at Morningstar. In XBI, ""you're going to have more early-stage biotech firms. A lot of these are publicly traded companies, but they have no drug on the market yet and have no profits.""XBI is up more this year but IBB has performed better over longer periods, with an average annual 38% vs. 23% in the past three years and 29% vs. 23% for five years.""IBB actually has better risk-adjusted returns over the long term,"" said Goldsborough.""I think that these stocks have done very, very well based on improving growth potential, rather than investors bidding up these companies just because,"" said Silver. ""It's been an exciting time, but I do think that it will continue to be an exciting time.""

3004,CELG,"Amid a generally tame week for the major indexes and just three trading days ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, the IBD 50 continued to showcase some big movers, both on the upside and downside.Among the strongest gainers, it was clear the role of 'N' in CAN SLIM — IBD's paradigm for successful equity investing — is vital.Biogen Idec (BIIB) led the week's advancers, soaring 16.6% for the week on positive news Friday from Europe regarding Tecfidera, a new oral drug for multiple sclerosis.A European governing body announced that the new drug will receive additional data protection because it contains a new active substance. This decision gives Tecfidera longer patent protection against rival generic drugmakers and will pave the way for the long-awaited launch in European Union nations. (See related story on A1.)Biogen is already a global leader in medicines used to fight the debilitating disease. But analysts see Tecfidera becoming the firm's biggest revenue generator by 2015.Biogen's weekly share volume surged 71% above its 10-week average as the stock probed all-time highs, reaching as high as 289.97. The stock closed at 285.62, up 95% since Jan. 1. It's rallied 22% past a 234.84 early buy point in an unusual 3-1/2-month cup-with-deep-handle base.Its Composite Rating is 98 and Sales + Margins + Return-on-equity Rating is a highest-possible A.Celgene (CELG) (Composite 97), noted in the same A1 story on biotech winners in today's IBD, also made new highs on favorable drug news. The cancer therapies specialist cruised 8% higher for the week in active turnover. Its sales have grown 13% to 18% vs. year-earlier levels for seven quarters in a row.Note how the stock has tested its 10-week moving average multiple times since clearing a 150.02 buy point. Such action is normal, especially during a market that shows choppy action.Direct marketer Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS), up 10% last week to new highs, continues to thrive on its successful Asia rollout of a new weight-management product.But sharp declines among Noah Holdings (NOAH), Lumber Liquidators (LL) and 3D Systems (DDD), serve as reminders that solid sell rules must always be implemented. Noah, the Chinese wealth management firm, hasn't necessarily triggered a sell signal by falling 16% for the week. The stock swings wider than most. But investors shouldn't let a decent breakout gain turn into a loss.

3107,CELG,"Several major biotech stocks rallied on Friday after Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) reported positive results from a Phase 2 study of its Ban2401 therapy, which seeks to reduce toxic amyloid proteins associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.Shares of Biogen were up more than 17% through afternoon trading hours Thursday. Japan’s Eisai Co. (ESALY  -  Free Report), a partner in the Ban2401 development, saw gains of nearly 20%. This momentum was enough to lift the rest of the biotech space, evidenced by the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund (IBB  -  Free Report) adding about 3.2%.Biotech giants like Biogen, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), and Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) have all underperformed the broader Nasdaq index over the past year, and the industry likely needed positive news to spark some optimistic trading.Speaking to The Street’s “Real Money” column, Atlantic Equities analyst Steve Chesney said that investors might finally be noticing the value of R&D efforts from these companies.“This is all about believing innovation and when a company like Biogen comes and reports positive clinical results for a disease like Alzehimer's the implied probability for success for the rest of the industry's pipeline moves a little bit higher,” Chesney told The Street.Celgene shares added about 2.3% to touch an intraday and one-month high of $82.34. Meanwhile, Amgen moved about 2% higher, and Gilead gained more than 3.3%.Biogen’s latest test included 856 patients with early Alzheimer’s disease. The company shared positive results from this group over a period of 18 months. Nevertheless, the trial is still only in Phase 2, and the challenges of Phase 3 and its additional regulatory hurdles are still looming.Still, Biogen will hope that it can commercialize Ban2401 in a timely manner. A new product would likely inspire positive analyst sentiment and lift growth prospects for the coming years.Within the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Biogen’s 2018 earnings has dropped from $23.90 per share to $23.85 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 9.4%.Early estimates for 2019 have the company’s earnings pegged at $26.19 per share, which would represent a 9.8% increase from this year’s projected totals.BIIB is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3108,CELG,"It’s been a pretty low-key week for the biotech sector, with not too many major updates. Among the key news, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR-T therapy won CHMP positive opinion, while Keryx Biopharmaceuticals (KERX  -  Free Report) plunged on merger news.Recap of Important Stories:Gilead’s CAR-T Therapy Gets Positive CHMP Opinion: Gilead announced that European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (""CHMP"") has issued a positive opinion on the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (""MAA"") for CAR T therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel, as a treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (""DLBCL"") and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (""PMBCL""), after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Axicabtagene ciloleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy, modifies a patient’s own T cells to recognize and attack cancer cells.The agency had granted PRIME status to axicabtagene ciloleucel in May 2016. A tentative approval is in the cards as the EMA generally takes the CHMP recommendation into account while reviewing any MAA. We note that axicabtagene ciloleucel was approved by the FDA in October 2017 as Yescarta.An approval in Europe will boost the growth prospects of the therapy, given the market potential.

(AMGN  -  Free Report) announced results from a phase III study, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of biosimilar candidate ABP 710 to branded drug Remicade. The results confirm ABP 710 was non-inferior compared to Remicade based on its primary endpoint, which was an assessment of ACR20 at week 22.The ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria are used to measure the effectiveness of various arthritis medicines in clinical studies.  An ACR20 score means that a person's RA has improved by 20%. Remicade is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, chronic severe plaque psoriasis, moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. We note that Amgen has a broad portfolio of 10 biosimilars, of which two are approved in the United States and three are approved in the European Union.In addition, Amgen announced encouraging results from two open-label extension (OLE) studies on migraine drug, Aimovig. Results from a one-year study in chronic migraine patients reinforced the established safety and efficacy profile of Aimovig in long-term use. Moreover, a three-year interim analysis from an ongoing five-year study of episodic migraine patients also reinforced the long-term safety and tolerability of Aimovig.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The candidate also met the key secondary endpoint of demonstrating a highly statistically significant improvement in RBC transfusion independence of at least 12 consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks.The study also achieved modified hematologic improvement-erythroid (IWG mHI-E), a meaningful secondary endpoint. Regulatory submissions are planned in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2019.  (Read more: Celgene's Luspatercept Meets Primary Endpoint in the Study)Keryx Plunges on Merger Deal with Akebia: Shares of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. plunged following announcement of a definitive merger agreement with Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (AKBA  -  Free Report). Both companies have agreed to combine in an all-stock merger and form a new, fully integrated company focused on chronic kidney diseases (or CKD) called Akebia Therapeutics.The deal is expected to close by the end of 2018. While Keryx already has an FDA approved drug Auryxia in its kitty, Akebia has a late-stage candidate in its pipeline. However, investors were not much impressed with the merger news and shares of both companies fell. (Read more: Keryx Inks Merger Deal With Akebia, Shares Fall)Cara Therapeutics Rallies On Positive Results: Shares of Cara Therapeutics, Inc. (CARA  -  Free Report) soared after the company announced positive top-line data from the adaptive phase II/III trial of intravenous (IV) CR845 in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries. The IV form of CR845 achieved statistical significance for the study’s primary endpoint of pain relief over the 0 to 24-hour (AUC 0-24) period post-surgery for combined surgeries at the 1.0 mcg/kg dose (p=0.032).In addition, the treatment with the same also resulted in statistically significant reductions in the secondary endpoint of incidence of nausea and vomiting at 24-hours post-surgery for both the 0.5 and 1.0 mcg doses (p=0.006; p<0.0001 respectively). The data demonstrate the overall benefit of CR845 in both providing pain relief across surgery types up to 24 hours post-surgery and reducing post-operative nausea and vomiting, a significant medical need in the post-operative setting. The brand name for the drug is Korsuva.The company had earlier inked a licensing deal with Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. whereby it licensed worldwide rights, to commercialize Korsuva (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 1.10% over the last five trading sessions.

3110,CELG,"Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that it has finalized its negotiations with private equity firm, Advent International to sell Zentiva, Sanofi’s generic business unit in Europe. The companies have signed a share purchase agreement worth $2.2 billion (1.9 billion euros).With the signing of this share purchase agreement, the closure of the transaction is now subject to approval from relevant regulatory authorities. An approval is expected during the fourth quarter of 2018.The sale of Zentiva is part of Sanofi’s plan to streamline its business as discussed in its 2020 strategic roadmap. However, the company will continue its generics business in other parts of the world.Shares of Sanofi have lost 7.7% so far this year compared with the industry’s 6.2% decrease.Sanofi, along with several other large pharma companies, is shifting its focus to high growth business like biotechnology and rare disease drugs. The pharma sector is facing pricing pressure from regulators as well as rising competition for many drugs since 2016. However, rare disease drugs command a higher price due to lower competition as well as rarity and severity of the diseases.We expect Sanofi to use the proceeds to acquire biotechs to boost its pipeline. In fact, the company acquired Bioverativ and Ablynx earlier this year for a total cost of $16 billion, adding hemophilia treatment and rare bleeding disorder candidates to its pipeline.Moreover, Sanofi strengthened its consumer healthcare by swapping its animal health business for Boehringer Ingelheim’s consumer healthcare business in early 2017.We remind investors that other big pharma companies are also on the lookout for biotechs to boost their pipeline as part of reprioritization and consolidation of business. Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) and Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) are two other companies that announced acquisition deals this year. We expect a few others to follow suit.

3111,CELG,"It has been a pretty ho-hum first-half of 2018 for the biotech sector. The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (^NBI) has lost 1.2% so far in 2018.The performance of biotech bigwigs has been affected by the slowdown in growth of key drugs. Competitive pressure will continue to impact sales. Nevertheless, new drug approvals boosted investor sentiment. Key approvals so far this year include Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) HIV regimen, Biktarvy; Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), Amgen’s Aimoviq for the treatment of migraine, and BioMarin’s Palynziq for the treatment of phenylketonuria, among others. The approval of these drugs should boost their respective companies’ top line as a few of them are struggling with decline in sales of legacy drugs.Increase in M&AMergers and acquisitions picked up pace in the sector as the slowdown in mature products has forced companies like Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) to eye lucrative acquisitions to bolster their pipeline. Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space. In February 2018, the company acquired Impact Biomedicines and added a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to its pipeline.Alexion will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics and add a late-stage candidate, WTX101, to its pipeline, which is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. Most recently, Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. and Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. announced a merger agreement under which both the companies will combine in an all-stock merger. We expect many more such deals in the latter half as well.What Lies Ahead?The Medical - Biomed/Genetics sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #153, which places it at the bottom 40% of the 255 plus Zacks industries. Although issues like drug pricing and threat of biosimilars loom large on the healthcare sector in large, we expect a better performance in the second half of 2018. New drug approvals, label expansion of existing high-profile drugs, pipeline progress, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should positively impact performance.Our ChoicesHere we list a few biotech stocks backed by a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and increase in share price, which look fairly placed for a good run in the second half of 2018:Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) is one of the leading biotech companies in the world. Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Blincyto, Vectibix, Kyprolis – are performing well.  The recent approval of migraine candidate, Aimovig was a huge boost. The biosimilars portfolio looks solid too with approved products like Amjevita, Mvasi, and a deep pipeline. While Amgen’s key drugs are facing biosimilar competition, we expect the newer drugs to offset the decline. The company has already undertaken a restructuring plan, which should lower costs and aid the bottom line. Amgen’s shares have gained 7% so far this year against a 8.6% decrease registered by the industry.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Athersys, Inc. (ATHX  -  Free Report) is primarily focused on regenerative medicine. The company’s patented and proprietary allogeneic stem cell product, MultiStem cell therapy, is its lead platform product. It is currently in advanced stages of clinical development for treating neurological conditions, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory and immune disorders, certain pulmonary conditions and other conditions in which the current standard of care is limited or inadequate for many patients, particularly in the critical care segment. Stem cell therapy has gained a lot of investor attention of late and companies with such candidates are in the spotlight.Athersys carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have gained 7.1% in the year so far against the industry decline of 8.6%. Celsion Corporation (CLSN  -  Free Report) is another company whose prospects look good.  The company is focused on developing a portfolio of innovative cancer treatments, including directed chemotherapies, immunotherapies and RNA- or DNA-based therapies. Its pipeline progress has been encouraging so far. ThermoDox, the company’s lead program, is a proprietary heat-activated liposomal encapsulation of doxorubicin, which is currently in phase III development for the treatment of primary liver cancer.  Other candidates in the pipeline include, GEN-1, a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of ovarian and brain cancers.  Celsion has two platform technologies for the development of novel nucleic acid-based immunotherapies and other anti-cancer DNA or RNA therapies. Immunotherapy holds a lot of potential as of now and the company’s impressive pipeline progress is a big positive for investors.Celsion carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of the company have returned 15.7% in the year so far against the industry decline of 8.6%. Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc.  (AGLE  -  Free Report) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company, which focuses on innovative human enzyme therapeutics for patients suffering from rare genetic diseases and cancer. The lead experimental therapy, pegzilarginase, is being evaluated for the treatment of Arginase 1 deficiency, as monotherapy in arginine-dependent cancers and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda, for small cell lung cancer. The company is also developing a pipeline of additional product candidates targeting key amino acids and other metabolites, including homocysteine (and the oxidized form homocystine), a target for another rare genetic disease as well as cysteine, and its oxidized form cystine, and methionine, for cancer indications.Aeglea carries a Zacks Rank #2.

3113,CELG," (0:15) - Drug Stocks: Value Traps or Opportunity? (1:30) - Tracey’s Top Stock Picks(11:45) - Health Service Industry(14:20) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #96 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Recently, investors on Stocktwits and Twitter have been asking about some of the drug stocks.If you look at the valuations, you can see why.Many are dirt cheap, with some trading with single digit P/Es.Problem is, the Street hates them (which makes them perfect for value investors.)Retail and energy stocks were hated over the last several years too but have staged big turnarounds in 2018.Will the drug stocks be the next big turnaround success story?Definition of a Value TrapRemember, a value trap is a stock that looks cheap based on basic value fundamentals like the P/E ratio.Who doesn’t like a company trading at 5x earnings?But sometimes there’s a reason for the cheapness. Investors have to look beyond the value fundamentals at earnings.Are they rising or falling?Rising earnings with a low P/E tells you that something right is going on at a company. But an earnings decline can be a sign that the company has lost its way.Value Stock or a Trap?1.       Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) has a forward P/E of just 11.8. Shares are down 13.3% over the last 2 years while the S&P 500 has gained 34.5% in that time. What are the earnings expected to do in 2018?2.       Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is trading with a forward P/E of 12.9. Year-to-date, the shares are down 8.4% but they’ve gained 28.5% over the prior 2 years. Estimates for 2018 have been cut in the last 60 days, but is there earnings growth?3.       Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) has taken a beating this year with shares falling 27% year-to-date. It’s now trading with a forward P/E of just 9.2. That’s cheap. But is it a trap?4.       Lannett (LCI  -  Free Report) is the cheapest among this group. It has a forward P/E of only 5.3. Should you take a chance? Shares are down 31% year-to-date and have fallen 35% the prior 2 years.5.       Valeant (VRX  -  Free Report) has had its problems the last few years but the shares have rebounded in 2018 and are up 22% compared to the S&P’s return of 3.4%. It’s also cheap, with a forward P/E of just 8. Is this the bottom of the earnings decline?There are lots of categories in the healthcare sector including the insurers, hospitals, device manufacturers, staffing and others.But the drug companies have been hit especially hard.Just because they’re cheap, however, doesn’t mean they’re a good buy. Investors need to do their homework.Value stock or a trap?Find out on this week’s podcast.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3114,CELG,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval to include the positive overall survival data in multiple myeloma from the late-stage ASPIRE study in Kyprolis label.Final data from the phase III ASPIRE study presented in July last year showed that a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis significantly improved overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.Overall survival data from the study showed that patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma lived 7.9 months longer when treated with Kyprolis plus Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd ) compared to those treated with Revlimid and dexamethasone (Rd) (median OS of 48.3 months for KRd versus median OS of 40.4 months for Rd). The data also showed that KRd reduced the risk of death by 21% compared to Rd.While Kyprolis, a proteasome inhibitor, is already approved for use in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, the overall survival data should help drive usage and boost sales.Amgen’s shares have gained 6.2% so far this year against the 6.8% decrease registered by the industry.A similar application is also under review in the EU. In April, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted a positive opinion recommending inclusion of the OS data from the ASPIRE study in the label of Kyprolis.In early 2018, Amgen gained FDA approval to include overall survival data from the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study on the label of KyprolisWith the approval to include OS results from ASPIRE study, Kyprolis label now includes OS data from two phase III studies which should drive sales of the drug in future quarters.Kyprolis has become a key revenue driver for Amgen. The drug recorded sales of $222 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing growth of 17% year over year, driven by increased demand and a robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Kyprolis represents significant commercial potential. Sales are likely to be driven by launch in additional countries, expansion into additional indications and a longer duration of treatment.Amgen also has a collaboration with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) to study the combination of Kyprolis and J&J’s Darzalex in multiple clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked biotech stock is BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.BioMarin’s earnings per share estimates increased 47.7% for 2018 and 20.0% for 2019 in the last 60 days.

3115,CELG,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced a partnership with Complement Pharma to co-develop the preclinical C6 complement inhibitor, CP010, for neurodegenerative disorders.CP010 is a humanized monoclonal antibody in preclinical stages that binds to C6 in circulation to inhibit its function throughout the body by preventing MAC formation in both the periphery and the central nervous system.Terms of the PartnershipPer the terms, Alexion and Complement Pharma will collaborate on the development program for CP010. Complement Pharma will be responsible for conducting preclinical and phase I studies as well as manufacturing CP010. In exchange, Alexion will provide Complement Pharma with up to €14 million in milestone-dependent payments through phase Ib development.   The phased agreement extends through the completion of phase Ib development. Moreover, Alexion has the option to acquire Complement Pharma during the term of the agreement.Rationale of the PartnershipAlexion is looking to diversify its portfolio beyond its key growth driver, Soliris. Soliris is approved for the treatment of two severe and ultra-rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system – paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).Since Soliris, a C5 inhibitor, has demonstrated the significant impact that C5 inhibition can have on various diseases caused by uncontrolled complement activation, the company plans to use its expertise to potentially treat additional diseases by targeting C6, a different component of the complement system.The company’s other pipeline candidate, ALXN1210 is an innovative, long-acting C5 inhibitor that works by inhibiting the C5 protein in the terminal complement cascade.Our TakeWhile the underlying growth of Soliris has been robust, Alexion is looking to develop its pipeline and reduce dependence on the former. The partnership with Complement Pharma is a step in the same direction and will also augment Alexion’s C5 franchise.Earlier, Alexion announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics for $855 million. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101, to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. The candidate is a first-in-class oral copper-binding agent with a unique mechanism of action and ability to access and bind copper from serum and promote its removal from the liver.The company also plans to use Halozyme's (HALO  -  Free Report) ENHANZE drug-delivery technology to develop a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 to potentially further extend the dosing interval to once every two weeks or once per month. Alexion’s shares have gained 2.7% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 6.7%.Of late, quite a few companies in the pharma/biotech sector are looking to diversify/bolster their portfolio/pipeline with acquisitions and collaborations. Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) recently acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space.  Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) acquired Bioverativ Inc., which focuses on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders.Zacks RankAlexion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3116,CELG,"Investors in the biotech sector were glued last week to the highly awaited 54th annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), which overshadowed the usual regulatory and other updates from the space. The meeting, held in Chicago (Jun 1-Jun 5) provides companies with a platform to showcase their data to scientists, physicians, the investment community and others. While the focus was mainly on ASCO data, companies like Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) remained in the limelight on pipeline updates.Recap of Important Stories:Biogen/Eisai Report Encouraging Data on Elenbecestat: Biogen along with partner Eisai announced encouraging results on its Alzheimer's candidate, elenbecestat, a BACE inhibitor, from a phase II study (Study 202). The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group 18-month study among patients (n=70) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease, or mild-to-moderate dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease with confirmed amyloid pathology by PET ((positron emission tomography) screening. All the patients were randomized to four treatment arms receiving elenbecestat (5, 15, or 50 mg) or placebo daily. More than half the patients in the elenbecestat 5 mg and 15 mg arms were switched to the 50 mg arm for three months or more. The data showed elenbecestat was generally safe and well tolerated. Results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in amyloid beta(Aβ) levels in the brain measured by amyloid-PET and suggested a delay of clinical symptom decline in exploratory endpoints. Eisai and Biogen are jointly developing elenbecestat since March 2014. Both companies are currently conducting two global phase III studies (MISSION AD1/2) on early Alzheimer’s disease.Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Both the companies had submitted the IND to the FDA in April to support the planned initiation of a phase I/II trial in the United States in adult patients with sickle cell disease. CTX001 is an experimental, gene-edited autologous hematopoietic stem cell therapy which is also being evaluated for patients suffering from β-thalassemia along with sickle cell disease.  Despite the FDA clinical hold, both the companies plan to initiate a phase I/II trial on CTX001 in Europe in adult patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia. CRISPR and Vertex will equally share all research and development costs and profits worldwide for CTX001.

(SRPT  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), has adopted a negative opinion for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) candidate, Exondys (eteplirsen). A negative opinion was expected following the oral explanation trend vote. Consequently, Sarepta will request a re-examination of the opinion, which will result in the assignment of a new rapporteur and co-rapporteur. Additionally, Sarepta will request a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) on DMD be called. This in turn will allow neuromuscular specialists to provide expert guidance and insight into, among other things, the validity of the external controls used and the importance of certain functional endpoints. The re-examination will be completed by the end of 2018.And finally a look at some ASCO results: Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) had multiple presentations on its oncology drugs Revlimid, Pomalyst along with other experimental therapies at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. Results from the TRANSCEND study on experimental CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy candidate, lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel; JCAR017), in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were encouraging.

3117,CELG,"The world of cancer research is changing fast. This space is seeing huge developments and companies are taking great strides in treating a variety of cancers.Cancer research is definitely an exciting area and one that investors will keep a close watch on in the coming years. This is because the disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world preceded only by heart disease.The five-day ASCO conference in Chicago, which is basically the most important annual cancer research event, concluded yesterday. The conference featured clinical updates from several companies about the latest developments in treating the disease.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) stole the limelight at ASCO after presenting data from several cancer studies of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda.The data presentation from Merck, which garnered the most attention from physicians and investors was from a second interim analysis of a pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE-407 study. The study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC, which is a difficult-to-treat lung cancer patient population. The data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival regardless of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 is a protein present on the surface of cells.The risk of death (OS) was reduced by 36% compared to chemotherapy alone. The PFS improvement was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone.The data was termed “practice changing” by CNBC – changing the way doctors look at prescribing these drugs to cancer patients. It further cemented Merck’s position in the lung cancer market, which is the most lucrative oncology sector.In this context, we must mention that Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) also presented data from a similar late-stage study, which showed that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 29% in advanced squamous NSCLC patients versus chemotherapy alone.Coming back to Merck, the company also presented data from another pivotal lung cancer study (KEYNOTE-042) evaluating Keytruda monotherapy in first-line NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression of at least 1%. This study also showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival. Meanwhile, four and five years follow-up data presented from two advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit. Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1.Meanwhile, Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC. Merck & partner AstraZeneca also presented positive Lynparza combo data in breast cancer. Shares of Merck have gone up by more than 3% since Friday, Jun 1 on ASCO strength.Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) was the biggest loser at ASCO. Nektar along with partner Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), presented preliminary data from a mid-stage study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Bristol-Myers’ PD-L1 inhibitor Opdivo in several tumor types. The response rates in melanoma and kidney cancer patients did not impress investors, resulting in a 42% fall in Nektar’s stock on Jun 4, which was probably the worst performance by an S&P 500 Index member in the last five years. (Read more: Nektar and Bristol-Myers Present Data on Cancer Study).Merck, Bristol-Myers and Nektar currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bristol-Myers also presented data on Opdivo at ASCO. In a late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in a broad range of patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma, Opdivo demonstrated sustained, superior recurrence-free survival versus Yervoy. In the study, Opdivo plus chemotherapy showed improved PFS versus chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and partner Bluebird Bio presented early-stage data for the CAR-T cell therapy bb2121 in patients with late-stage relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Though the study showed a median PFS of 11.8 months in this heavily pre-treated patient population, the data did not impress investors.Celgene also presented data on another CAR-T therapy - liso-ce (JCAR017) - which it acquired from its acquisition of Juno earlier this year. The data showed that at six months, 49% of the patients with relapsed/refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) remained in remission while 46% maintained a complete response. (Read more: Celgene Presents Data on CAR T Therapy, Revlimid & Pomalyst)Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced positive data from a combination study on breast cancer drug Kisqali and from two long-term leukemia studies on Tasigna. (Read More: Novartis Announces Positive Data on Kisqali and Tasigna).AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) presented early data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of its cancer drugs Imbruvica plus Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  The data demonstrated high rates of responses in such patients. Also, interim data from a late-stage study evaluating Imbruvica plus Roche’s Rituxan in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showed that the combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 80% compared to placebo plus Rituxan.Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca and J&J also made some cancer data presentations at the meeting.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3118,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) presented data on its oncology drugs Revlimid, Pomalyst along with other experimental therapies in the presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL.Celgene announced encouraging updated six-month safety and efficacy data from the open-label, multicenter phase I study, TRANSCEND (NHL-001), on experimental CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy candidate, lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel; JCAR017), in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) at the ASCO. TRANSCEND is being conducted to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of liso-cel in adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma Grade 3B, and mantle cell lymphoma.Based on a cutoff date of May 4, 2018, 49% of patients remained in remission with 46% maintaining a complete response (CR) in this cohort (n=37). Durability of response beyond six months was evaluated across all dosing levels ranging from 5 x 107 to 1 x 108 CAR T cells, wherein 93% of patients in CR remained in CR at data cut-off. The data demonstrate the potential of the candidate in patients with DLBCL, who have relapsed or are refractory to prior treatments.Concurrently, Celgene also announced additional results from the phase III randomized, open-label, international study, RELEVANCE at the ASCO. The study was conducted in partnership with the Lymphoma Academic Research Organisation (LYSARC). The study evaluated Revlimid plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan (rituximab) (R2), followed by R2 maintenance (an investigational regimen) compared to the standard of care treatment of rituximab plus chemotherapy, followed by rituximab maintenance in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. Results showed that treatment with a chemotherapy-free R2 regimen offered numerically similar efficacy results for the primary endpoints of progression free survival (PFS) and complete response or unconfirmed complete response (CR/CRu) at 120 weeks with a different safety profile than treatment with the conventional R-chemo standard.Celgene had earlier reported that the study did not achieve the primary endpoints of superior PFS and CR/CRu. The company now awaits results from the AUGMENT study, which is evaluating this important regimen in previously treated patients with indolent lymphomas.Earlier, Celgene and partner bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) announced encouraging updated results from the ongoing open-label phase I study, CRB-401 on bb2121, an experimental anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T cell therapy in 43 patients with late-stage relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The study is evaluating the preliminary safety and efficacy of bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.Patients in the study were heavily pre-treated with a median of seven prior myeloma treatment regimens (min, max: 3,14) in the dose escalation cohort (n=21) and eight prior regimens (min, max: 3, 23) in the dose expansion cohort (n=22). The study results show that responses were dose-related and observed for both low and high BCMA expression levels. The median progression-free survival (PFS) estimate for patients in the dose-escalation phase, treated at active doses, was 11.8 months, while patients receiving 50 x 106 CAR+ T cells had a median PFS of 2.7 months.We remind investors that bb2121 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the United States and PRIME eligibility from the EMA. In addition, Celgene has also sponsored an open-label, single-arm, pivotal, phase II study (KarMMa), which is currently recruiting in North America and Europe, to evaluate bb2121 further in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (NCT03361748).Moreover, Celgene also presented positive data for a phase III randomized, open-label study, OPTIMISMM, on the experimental combination regimen of Pomalyst, bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), who had received at least one prior treatment including lenalidomide at the ASCO.The trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Pomalyst/Imnovid (pomalidomide) plus bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone (PVd) versus bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with early RRMM. The study data showed that the treatment with PVd resulted in significantly improved PFS and an earlier, deeper and more durable response in these patients compared to Vd treatment.  The study met its primary endpoint.Pomalyst in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for patients with multiple myeloma, who have received at least two prior therapies.Celgene is desperately looking to revamp its portfolio, due to series of setbacks over the last few months.Celgene’s stock has lost 23% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 6.4%. Celgene suffered a setback when it received a Refusal to File letter from the FDA, regarding the New Drug Application (NDA) for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Moreover, the threat of generic competition is also looming large on Revlimid, which loses patent protection in 2022 forcing Celgene to look for acquisitions.  Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions, given a lacklustre 2017 and the Juno acquisition was on the same track. Celgene announced a global collaboration with Prothena (PRTA  -  Free Report) in March 2018 to develop new therapies for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases primarily focused on three proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed target.Zacks RankCelgene is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3119,CELG,"In spite of a strong start in 2018, the pharma/biotech industry is struggling currently, presumably due to a shift in focus to lowering of high drug prices and faster approval of generics. Moreover, quite a few negative pipeline and regulatory updates announced this year so far have probably had an unfavorable impact on the industry.However, we expect the industry to turn around as the year progresses. Demand for drugs is rising worldwide due to increasing ailing and elderly population, frequent approval of new drugs as well as line extensions of already marketed drugs, and increased healthcare spending.Moreover, reduction in tax and one-time low tax window for cash repatriation has boosted the cash position of large pharma companies. This has led to an increase in merger & acquisition activity and may boost innovation and capital building in the biotech industry. With the $62 billion price tag, the proposed acquisition of Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) by Japanese-firm Takeda is the biggest deal in the industry. Earlier in the year, we have seen Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) acquiring smaller biotech companies. Impax Laboratories merged with Amneal. Other large pharma companies are also on the lookout for acquisition targets.Why Large Caps?Given the current dampening mood, we focus on some large-cap companies to lower portfolio risk.Putting your money in large-cap companies reduces risk due to their diversified portfolio and a large cash base. Moreover, the companies' stability and dividend payments provide a safety cushion to one’s portfolio. Moreover, in a flat or downtrend market, it is better to focus on specific stocks. Large caps also give high returns and are less risky than small and mid-caps.However, the large-cap pharma industry is down 4.5% so far this year while the S&P 500 has risen 2.3%. But the large-cap industry ranks among the top half of the 255 Zacks industry list.The below mentioned stocks have risen this year so far, outperforming the large-cap pharma industry. Let’s discuss the factors driving these stocks and why one should add them to their portfolio.AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) shares have gained 6% so far this year on the back of several regulatory approvals and successful study results this year.The company’s Lynparza became the first PARP inhibitor to be approved beyond ovarian cancer as the FDA approved its label expansion in metastatic breast cancer. Another cancer drug, Imfinzi’s label was expanded to include advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) indication. Tagrisso’s eligible patient population was expanded recently as it is now approved for treating first-line NSCLC with EGFR mutations.Apart from cancer drugs, AstraZeneca’s asthma drug, Fasenra, received approval in Europe for severe eosinophilic asthma. Moreover, the company added a new drug to its portfolio with the approval of Lokelma (formerly known as ZS-9) for hyperkalemiaAstraZeneca’s triple combination therapy, PT010, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”) significantly improved several lung functions compared with dual combination therapies – per data from a late-stage KRONOS study.These approvals for new drugs as well as line extensions are likely to boost the company’s top line in the future quarters. In addition, a regulatory application seeking label expansion of Forxiga as an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in adults with type-1 diabetes was accepted for review in March in Europe. Thus, we expect the stock’s momentum to continue. However, negative regulatory updates or data readouts may impact the stock unfavorably, key among them being the final overall survival data from MYSTIC study, which has already been delayed.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) stock has gained 7.6% so far this year backed by encouraging data from several clinical studies evaluating Keytruda as well label expansions of the drug.Keytruda received approval for treating urothelial carcinoma in Japan. Moreover, label expansion in advanced cervical cancer is under review in the United States. Several other regulatory decisions are pending in the United States as well as Europe.The drug has shown encouraging development in clinical studies. Keytruda significantly improved recurrence-free survival (“RFS”) in melanoma patients and overall survival (“OS”) in NSCLC patients as monotherapy. In combination with Eli Lilly’s Alimta, Keytruda improved overall survival (“OS”) and progression-free-survival (“PFS”) in first-line NSCLC. These positive data readouts increase the probability of Keytruda’s label expansion..Moreover, data readouts from a few clinical studies evaluating Keytruda, including two pivotal lung cancer studies, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago were also encouraging.Apart from Keytruda, Merck’s anti-cancer drug, Lenvima, was approved in Japan for label expansion in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”), a type of liver cancer. Moreover, label expansion of AstraZeneca’s Lynparza in breast cancer will also boost Merck’s revenues as the latter shares development and commercialization costs as well as sales with AstraZeneca.Meanwhile, Merck’s immunotherapy pipeline for cancer treatment is expected to get a boost with the completion of the acquisition of Australian Firm, Viralytics Limited, in the second quarter. We expect growth of new drugs to continue, which will offset the loss of sales of certain products due to loss of market exclusivity. This should drive the company’s shares higher going forward.GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) influenza vaccine – FluarixQuadrivalent – got approval for label expansion in infants six months or older in the United States and Europe. HIV treatment, Juluca, was approved in Europe.  Moreover, the company’s shingles vaccine nears approval in Europe as in January the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion for the marketing authorization application. In May, the FDA approved the label expansion of asthma therapy, Arnuity Ellipta, as a maintenance treatment in pediatric patients aged five years and older.Moreover, the approval of three new products – Trelegy Ellipta, Shingrix and Juluca – in quick succession in the United States and Europe last year/early this year boosted the company’s top line as the drugs’ uptake was encouraging.In addition, the agreement to acquire Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) stake in the Consumer Healthcare JV is likely to strengthen its competitive position.The stock has rallied 14.9% so far this year.AstraZeneca, Merck and Glaxo are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks.

3120,CELG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.9% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CELG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Celgene Q1 Earnings & Sales Beat on Revlimid StrengthCelgene reported encouraging first-quarter 2018 results wherein both earnings and sales topped expectations.The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.05 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.00, up from $1.67 in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues grew 19.4% to $3.54 billion in the quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.50 billion. Revenues were boosted by consistent performance of the company’s key growth driver, Revlimid.Revlimid — Key CatalystNet product sales increased 20% year over year to $3.5 billion. Net sales of Revlimid came in at $2.2 billion, reflecting 19% year-over-year growth. The drug performed well both in the United States (up 21%) and international markets (up 15%). Growth in the quarter was driven by increased volume as a result of increases in duration of treatment and market share.Net sales of another cancer drug, Abraxane increased 11% to $262 million as sales benefited from buying patterns.  Pomalyst/Imnovid came in at $453 million, up 24%. Sales were driven by increased volume due to increase in market share and duration.Otezla sales were $353 million in the quarter, up 46%. Sales in the United States were primarily volume-driven due to increasing demand and improved access pull-through in contracted health plans while sales in international markets were driven primarily by increasing adoption in key ex-U.S. markets.All other product sales (including Istodax, Thalomid, Vidaza and an authorized generic version of Vidaza in the United States) totaled $229 million in the quarter, up from $226 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted research and development expenses increased 16.6% to $694 million due to higher spending related to drug discovery and clinical trial activity while adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 24.5% to $671 million.Pipeline UpdateCelgene acquired acquire Juno Therapeutics, Inc. for approximately $9 billion in March 2018. In February 2018, the company also acquired Impact Biomedicines and added a late stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to its pipeline.Celgene announced a global collaboration with Prothena in March 2018 to develop new therapies for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases primarily focused on three proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed target.Celgene's partner bluebird bio opted to co-develop and co-promote bb2121, an experimental anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of patients with RRMM in the United States in March 2018. Both companies had originally entered into a broad, global strategic research collaboration in 2013 to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies in oncology, which included bb2121. The agreement was amended in 2015.However, Celgene suffered a setback when it received a Refusal To File letter from the FDA regarding the New Drug Application (NDA) for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Celegne now plans to resubmit the NDA in the first quarter of 2019 following a Type A meeting with the FDA in early April. The company also plans to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for ozanimod in RMS in the first quarter of 2019.2018 Outlook UpdatedCelgene now anticipates earnings per share of $8.45 in 2018 compared to the earlier estimate of $8.70-$8.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $8.44 per share.  Net revenues are now estimated around $14.8 billion, at the high end of the previously projected range of $14.4-$14.8 billion, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $14.84 billion. The numbers include the impact of dilution from the Juno acquisition.Revlimid sales are now projected at $9.5 billion, up from $9.4 billion estimated earlier. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. Pomalyst’s revenues are now projected at around $2.0 billion (previous projection: $1.9 billion). Otezla sales continued to be projected at $1.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.Celgene Corporation Price and Consensus Celgene Corporation Price and Consensus | Celgene Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, CELG has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, CELG has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

3121,CELG,"Though the drug sector was off to a strong start in 2018, it has struggled thereafter probably on U.S. market instability and a few negative updates on the pipeline and regulatory front. Also, a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs, courtesy of payers and competitive pressure from both branded and generic drugs, is a concern for the sector. Moreover, concerns about pressure on drug prices continue to cloud shares of pharma and biotech companies.Drug pricing has been in the spotlight once again this month when President Donald Trump announced plans to lower prescription drug costs. He laid out his vision of increasing competition, lowering consumers’ out-of-pocket costs for drugs, creating incentives to lower list prices, cutting down regulatory burdens and asking the FDA to make it compulsory for drug companies to display prices in their TV advertisements.The biotech industry has declined 9.9% this year so far, underperforming the 0.5% rise for the S&P 500 in the same time frame. Nonetheless, any ace investor will know that the drug/biotech sector has been one of the best-performing industries in the U.S. stock market. It is widely expected that the biotech/drug sector will rebound as the year progresses. We believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, frequent FDA approvals, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits.Importantly, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is ramping up with the tax reform in place. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is spurring merger activity this year.The biggest M&A deal announced this year is Takeda’s proposed acquisition of Shire for $62 billion. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) have already snapped up two companies each. Impax Laboratories and Amneal merged in May to form a new company, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMRX). Needless to say, biggies like Pfizer, Merck, J&J, Lilly among others have consistently announced co-development deals and small biotech acquisitions this year.With the outlook optimistic for the rest of the year, here we have highlighted five stocks that may prove to be good buys. All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise this year so far.

3122,CELG,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on May 1, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.71%.The pharma giant has a strong record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.97%.Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Pfizer Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pfizer Inc. QuotePfizer’s shares have risen 2.3% this year so far against a decrease of 4.3% for the industry. Factors at PlayIn the Innovative Health (IH) segment, new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) should contribute to the top line meaningfully. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Ibrance (worldwide), Lyrica (IH), Xeljanz and Chantix are $973 million, $1.19 billion, $396 million and $272 million, respectively.In the Essential Health (EH), biosimilars and emerging markets are expected to support sales.However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products, primarily Pristiq in the United States will continue to hamper top-line growth.Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Enbrel is $540 million.The Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise may continue to see lower sales in United States while lower demand and generic competition should continue to hurt sales of Viagra.Pfizer is facing supply shortages for products from the legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues. We expect supply shortages will continue to hurt sales. Pfizer expects to cut down the sterile injectable shortages in 2019.New cancer drugs Bavencio/avelumab, Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin and Mylotarg are likely to contribute to overall sales this time around.Xeljanz, Sutent and Bosulif were approved for line extensions in the fourth quarter of 2017. All these new products and line extensions are like to boost Q1 sales.The bottom line is expected to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks.We also expect management to provide an update on initial launch uptake for Pfizer and partner Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) newly approved oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) tablets. Apart from being approved as a monotherapy to treat type II diabetes, Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name Segluromet and with Januvia under the brand name, Steglujan.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate (75 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (74 cents) is +1.36%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some large health care stocks worth considering per our model. These have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 26.

3123,CELG,"The performance of the drug industry in first-quarter 2018 has been an encouraging one with quite a few companies’ beatings both earnings as well as revenue estimates.The overall investor sentiment toward pharma and biotech stocks has improved of late as investors are focusing more on fundamentals than on issues like drug pricing. While drug pricing will continue to pose as a major deterrent, thanks to the government increased emphasis on making drugs affordable, new drug approvals and label expansion of existing drugs should help companies maintain the momentum in 2018. The year 2017 saw a number of drugs like Rhopressa, Tymlos, Ozempic, Vyzulta, Siliq, Trulance, Hemlibra, among others getting approval.  Lutathera, Ilumya, Symdeko, Biktarvy, Erleada have already been approved in 2018 and investors are expected to keep their focus on the same.Mergers and acquisitions remain another key area of investor focus. While 2017 was pretty ho-hum on this front with just a few key deals, 2018 is expected to see a surge in M&A primarily due to lower U.S. tax rates.  Taking a clue from Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) acquisition of Kite Pharma, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) recently acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space.  Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) acquired Bioverativ Inc. which focuses on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders. The company has also obtained anti-trust clearances in connection with its previously announced acquisition of Ablynx.  While strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending should support growth in this sector, caution is to be exercised when picking stocks for investing.Here are a few sell-rated stocks which should be strictly avoided for now:Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report):  Canada-based specialty pharma company, Valeant, has been in troubled waters for quite some time now. Valeant’s guidance for 2018 was disappointing. After a tumultuous period, Valeant started a rebuilding process with its CEO, Joseph C. Papa.  The company has reduced total debt by approximately $6.7 billion since the end of first-quarter 2016. However, the dermatology business remains challenging and is expected to decline in 2018 as compared to 2017.  Quite a few of its drugs are facing generic competition. Hence, it might be a while before the company turn arounds as management had projected. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  Valeant’s shares have declined 25.6% in the last three months, compared with industry’s fall of 2.8%.  Endo International plc (ENDP  -  Free Report): Ireland-based Endo is a global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on generic and branded pharmaceuticals. Endo’s guidance for 2018 was way below expectations. The generics business is under tremendous pressure due to the loss of marketing exclusivity for the first-to-file products ezetimibe tablets and quetiapine ER tablets in the first half of 2017. The branded pharmaceuticals business was impacted by continued generic competition for established products, product divestitures and ceasing shipments of Opana ER and this is expected to continue further. Endo withdrew opioid pain medication Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride extended release) from the market following FDA’s request in June 2017.  The company divested its non-core assets such as Belbuca and restructured its pain franchise to focus particularly on specialty branded business. However, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company is expected to face challenging business conditions in 2018. Endo’s shares have lost 25.8% in the last three months worse than the industry’s decline of 2.8%.  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report): Irvine, CA-based Aerie Pharmaceuticals focuses on the development and commercialization of eye disease therapies, including glaucoma and other eye-diseases. Aerie received a significant boost with the recent approval of lead drug Rhopressa for the lowering of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  However, Rhopressa faces stiff competition from established branded and generic pharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis’ Simbrinza and Travtan, and Allergan’s Lumigan, as well as other smaller biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Valeant’s Vyzulta was recently approved for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Rhopressa will face a tough time in gaining market share due to competition from these products. Hence, we advise investors to steer clear of this Zacks Rank #4 stock for the time being. Aerie’s shares have fallen 13.8% in the last three months, worse than the industry’s decline of 2.8%.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

3124,CELG,"We are approaching the end of the first quarter of 2018. Let us asses how the quarter unfolded for the drug/biotech sector.The year began on a strong note for the drug/biotech sector, particularly on expectations of an increase in M&A activity. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) have already announced two deals each. Also Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) is aggressively on the lookout for a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare unit after British firms Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Reckitt Benckiser Group pulled out of discussions.After a solid run in the first two months of the first quarter, the drug/biotech sectors struggled in March, probably on broader market pressure and a few negative updates on the pipeline and regulatory front.The large-cap pharma industry has declined 4.6% this year so far while the biotech industry has declined 5.7% in the same time frame. Both have underperformed the 2.9% fall for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.  However, please note that in the first two months of the year, both the sectors recorded gains and so did the S&P 500. However, all three declined in the month of March.What Put Breaks on the Momentum?AbbVie’s Rova-T fell short of expectations in a key lung cancer study. Dermira’s acne candidate, olumacostat glasaretil, surprisingly failed to meet the primary endpoint in two studies. Celgene was issued a refusal to file letter by the FDA for Ozanimod (multiple sclerosis) NDA and Biogen and partner AbbVie announced the voluntary decision to withdraw multiple sclerosis drug, Zinbryta from worldwide markets due to risk of liver injury. Orexigen Therapeutics meanwhile filed for bankruptcy. Solid Biosciences’ mid-stage study on lead duchenne muscular dystrophy candidate SGT-001 was put on clinical hold and Protagonist Therapeutics announced discontinuation of a mid-stage study on its key ulcerative colitis treatment.Is a Recovery in the Cards?It is widely expected that the biotech/drug sector will rebound as the year progresses. We believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals, continued strong performance of key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits.With the outlook optimistic for the rest of the year, here we highlight four stocks that may prove to be good buys. All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.GlaxoAfter underperforming the broader industry in 2017, Glaxo’s shares have picked up this year. Glaxo’s stock has risen 7.3% this year so far. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 rose 5% and 4.8%, respectively in the past 60 days.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is expected to record sales growth of 4% this year and 2.5% next yearAdverum Biotechnologies (ADVM  -  Free Report) Adverum Biotechnologies carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Loss estimates for the company narrowed 24.3% for 2018 and 26.2% for 2019 over the last 60 days. Sales growth this year for this biotech stock is expected to be 8.2%. Adverum shares have returned 83.5% this year so far.Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report)This #2 Ranked stock has risen 23.3% this year while earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 rose 11.1% and 12%, respectively, over the past 60 days. This company is expected to record sales growth of around 25% this year and 18% next year.H. Lundbeck A/S (HLUYY  -  Free Report)On a year-to-date basis, Lundbeck shares have gained 13.1%. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for 2018 increased 8.5% over the past 60 days for this #2 Ranked stock.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3125,CELG,"Key highlights of the week include Alexion gaining on positive data on PNH candidate, Arena surges on ulcerative drug data, Solid Biosciences’ stock suffering a crash and Prothena teaming up with Celgene.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAlexion Up on Positive Data From PNH Candidate:  Shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) gained after the company reported positive data on candidate, ALXN1210 from a pivotal phase III study. This phase III randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multinational, and multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ALXN1210 compared to Alexion’s lead drug Soliris administered by intravenous infusion to adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) who are naïve to complement inhibitor treatment. ALXN1210 demonstrated non-inferiority to Soliris in complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients with PNH based on the co-primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and normalization of lactate dehydrogenase (“LDH”) levels. In addition, the study also demonstrated non-inferiority on all four key secondary endpoints — percentage change from baseline in LDH levels, change from baseline in quality of life as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (“FACIT”) — Fatigue scale, proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, and proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin levels. Alexion plans to submit ALXN1210 in PNH in the United States, EU, and Japan in the second half of 2018. (Read more: Alexion Gains on Positive Date From Lead Candidate)Arena Pharma Gains on Positive Results on Ulcerative Colitis Candidate: Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA  -  Free Report) stock gained 29% after the company’s selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator candidate, etrasimod met the primary endpoint in a phase II study, OASIS for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.  The trial met primary and all secondary endpoints with statistical significance for patients receiving 2 mg dose of etrasimod for 12 weeks. Clinical remission (“CR”) was achieved in 33% of the patients on etrasimod versus 8.1% for placebo based on the three-component Mayo Clinic Scale.  Moreover, 41.8% of patients achieved endoscopic improvement compared to 17.8% for placebo.  The candidate achieved CR in 24.5% of patients compared with 6% for placebo based on a four-point Mayo Clinic Scale. Based on these data, Arena is planning to initiate a phase III program for further development of etrasimod for treatment of UC. (Read more: Arena's Etrasimod Meets Phase II Colitis Study Goal)Solid Biosciences Plummets on Results on Lead Drug: Shares of Solid Biosciences (SLDB  -  Free Report) plummeted significantly after the FDA notified the company that its phase I/II trial, IGNITE DMD, on lead candidate SGT-001 has been put on clinical hold. SGT-001 is being evaluated for the underlying genetic cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in the absence or near-absence of dystrophin protein. The clinical hold was placed after one of the patients was hospitalized due to laboratory findings which included a decrease in platelet count, followed by a reduction in red blood cell count and evidence of complement activation. As a result, enrolment and dosing has been stopped in the phase III study. (Read more: Solid Biosciences Hit by Clinical Hold on Lead Drug)Regeneron’s Eylea Reports Positive Data From Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Trial: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) announced that the phase III trial, PANORAMA, evaluating lead drug, Eylea in moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (“NPDR”) met its 24-week primary endpoint. The results show that 58% of patients treated with Eylea experienced a two-step or greater improvement from baseline on the Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale at week 24, compared to 6% of patients receiving sham injection. The positive data from the trial will form the basis of a supplemental Biologics License Application which is expected to be submitted to the FDA later in 2018.  Eylea is already approved for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (“DME”), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, which includes macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion. A potential label expansion will further boost sales. (Read more: Regeneron Eylea Hits 24-Week Primary Endpoint in Study)Regeneron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

The multi-year agreementis focused on three proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed target. Celgene will own the rights to license clinical candidates in the United States at the investigational new drug (IND) filing and if exercised, would also have a right to expand the license to global rights at the completion of phase I.  Consequently, Celgene will be responsible for funding all further global clinical development and commercialization.  In exchange, Prothena will receive a $100-million upfront payment. Celgene will also make a $50-million equity investment in Prothena by subscribing to approximately 1.2 million of ordinary shares at $42.57 per share.  Prothena is also eligible for any regulatory and commercial milestones for each licensed program. Prothena will also receive additional royalties on net sales of any resulting marketed products.

3127,CELG,"Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  along with partner Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced additional data from a phase I study (TRANSCEND) on its lead pipeline candidate, JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel), for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). Results were presented at the 59th annual meeting of American Society of Hematology.Notably, JCAR017 is a next-generation chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell (CAR-T) receptor product that targets CD19.The company presented separate data from the TRANSCEND study for the full group of patients enrolled as well as the core group i.e. a high-risk patient population.Finds from the multi-center TRANSCEND trial demonstrated that at dose level 2, 74% of patients with the aforementioned indication showed an overall response rate (ORR) and 68% complete response (“CR”) rate at three months in core group. Additionally, 50% of patients showed CR at six months.These figures are better than the previous data of 66% ORR and 50% CR reported in June. Moreover, the safety profile of JCAR017 remains impressive with only 1% of patients experiencing severe cytokine release syndrome and 15% experiencing severe neurotoxicity.It is interesting to note that Juno’s shares dropped almost 15% following the news release probably as investors expected better response rates. However, shares of Juno have significantly gained 166.5% of its value so far this year, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 3%.Good news is that the safety and efficacy outcomes showed better overall and complete responses compared with Gilead's (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta and Novartis' (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah CART therapy, which have recently launched in the United States.The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL by the end of 2018 with a biologics license application expected to be filed in the second half of 2018.We note that, bluebird bio also announced five months of follow-up data from the ongoing phase I study of its CAR-T therapy candidate- bb2121. The study is evaluating the preliminary safety and efficacy of bb2121 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.

3128,CELG,"We expect AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%.Shares of AbbVie have marginally outperformed the industry so far this year. While the stock has declined 4.1%, the industry has decreased 4.3%. Notably, AbbVie’s earnings history is quite impressive with the pharmaceuticals company having outpaced estimates in all the last four quarters with an average beat of 1.81%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAbbVie expects first-quarter 2018 earnings in the range of $1.77-$1.79 per share. Revenues are estimated to grow in a mid-teen range on an operational basis. Foreign exchange is anticipated to gain a 3% favorable impact on sales in the period to be reported.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain a key growth driver in the first quarter, backed by strong demand trends for the drug. AbbVie expects Humira sales to reflect a rise in the low-teens band in the imminent earnings release while internationally, the growth rate is projected in a mid-single-digit range, operationally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humira is pegged at $4.7 billion.Significantly, on first-quarter conference call, investors’ focus will also be on the performance level as well as the label expansion updates of AbbVie’s another cancer drug, Imbruvica. The drug has been recording strong sales since the past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue even in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica stands at $759 million.Other drugs, namely Duopa and Creon are also likely to maintain an encouraging performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, AbbVie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to see declining sales, affected by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Moreover, in March 2018, AbbVie’s rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T fell short of expectations in a phase II TRINITY study, evaluating it in third-line therapy for later small cell lung cancer (SCLC). On first-quarter conference call, we expect management to provide updates on the same.Notably, AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret, secured an approval in the United States, EU, Canada as well as Japan in the second half of 2017. Importantly, Mavyret recorded $500 million global sales last year. The initial uptake of the drug has been commendable and we expect its higher sales in the first quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: AbbViehas an Earnings ESP of +0.06%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.80 per share. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AbbViehas a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and together with a positive ESP, chances of the stock beating estimates in its upcoming release are always pegged higher.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of other health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to also surpass estimates this time around:Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on May 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.36% and a Zacks Rank #2.

3129,CELG,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. So far, the results reflect a favorable trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating both top- and bottom-line expectations.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the 251 S&P members that have released results, are up 16% from the year-ago quarter on a 10.5% rise in revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line is 80.5%, while that for the top line is 78.1%. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 64.9%.Biotech companies Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) are expected to report their Q4 numbers on Feb 8. Let's take a look at which of these biotech companies has an edge over the other ahead of their release.However, before we look at the numbers, let us have a look at the biotech industry.A Glance at the IndustryThe biotech industry is seeing significant pickup in merger and acquisition (M&A) deals of late. The year started off with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) announcing plans to acquire Impact Biomedicines. The company revealed plans of acquiring Juno Therapeutics  for approximately $9 billion.The French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) also announced of buying biopharma company Bioverativ for $11.6 billion in January 2018. The same month Sanofi also announced plans to acquire the Belgian biotech company, Ablynx for €3.9 billion ($4.8 billion).In the fourth quarter, the biotech sector is well poised. Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) put a mixed show in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations.Alexion New Haven, CT-based Alexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform. Alexion is working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications. The FDA recently approved the drug for the treatment of refractory gMG in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive. The drug was approved in Europe for this indication. Label expansion into additional indications will give Soliris access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.The company also announced some restructuring initiatives. In this context, Alexion plans to focus on rare diseases businesses in core areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology and metabolic disorders to enhance productivity.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $878 million, marking an increase of 5.5% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.28 per share, marking an increase of 1.59% year over year.Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has topped estimates in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.91%.Alexion has an Earnings ESP of +8.92% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.40 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.28. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteRegeneron Regeneron’s key growth driver, Eylea, is likely to continue to contribute to the company’s top-line growth. Regeneron is working on expanding Eylea label into additional indications. While a phase III study (PANORAMA) is evaluating Eylea for the treatment of moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients without DME, another phase III study (in Japan) is evaluating it for neovascular glaucoma. Label expansion into additional indications will give Eylea access to higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug. Apart from Eylea, investors will remain focused on the uptake of new drugs — Kevzara and Dupixent. The FDA also approved Dupixent (dupilumab) Injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.  The initial uptake of the drug is encouraging. The drug was approved in Europe also. The company is also evaluating the drug for treating asthma in adults (LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study). Hence, focus will be on the company’s performance, particularly Eylea and Dupixient uptake during the fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors are also expected to await updates on the company’s pipeline.The Earnings ESP, for Regeneron is -1.04%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.50 billion, marking an increase of 22.1% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $4.68 per share, marking an increase of 53.95% year over year.The company’s performance has been mixed so far. In the last four quarters, it surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions and missed in two, with an average positive surprise of 5.96%. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteOur TakeDuring fourth-quarter 2017, Alexion’s price declined 14.8% compared with Regeneron’s fall of 15.9%. However, Alexion’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For Regeneron, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) before going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Therefore, per our proprietary model, we believe that Alexion is poised for better performance in the upcoming quarter.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

The announcement comes just a few weeks after Novo Nordisk had announced its interest in acquiring Ablynx in a deal valued at approximately €2.6 billion. Ablynx had rejected Novo Nordisk’s offer with the company’s Board saying that the proposal fundamentally undervalued Ablynx and its growth prospects.A look at Ablynx’s pipeline shows that the company could well be in a position to launch its first product, caplacizumab (anti-vWF; acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - aTTP), this year. Caplacizumab is currently under review in the EU while a regulatory application will be filed in the United States in the first half of 2018. The estimated annual market opportunity for aTTP, a life-threatening blood clotting disease, is expected to be about €1.2 billion. The company also has a broad range of partnerships with the potential to generate more than €10.6 billion in milestones plus royalties. Other pipeline candidates also address significant market opportunities. The company has more than 45 programs in its pipeline and eight Nanobodies in clinical development. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018 (Read more: Sanofi on a Buyout Spree This Month, to Buy Ablynx for $4.8B).Bellicum Down on FDA Clinical Hold: Bellicum Pharmaceuticals’s shares are down almost 30% following the company’s announcement that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on U.S. studies being conducted on BPX-501. The hold was placed after three cases of encephalopathy were deemed as possibly connected to BPX-501. The company said that the cases were complex with certain factors like prior failed transplants, prior history of immunodeficiency, concurrent infection, and administration of rimiducid in combination with other medications.Bellicum is now waiting to receive a formal notice from the FDA as to the steps needed to be taken for the resumption of the studies. The clinical hold will not impact an ongoing registration study in Europe.Seattle Genetics to Boost Pipeline with Cascadian Acquisition: Seattle Genetics announced that it will be acquiring Cascadian Therapeutics for $10 per share in cash, or about $614 million. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first quarter of 2018, Seattle will be adding tucatinib to its pipeline. Tucatinib is an investigational oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor that is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian and gastric. The candidate is currently in a pivotal phase II program for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer and complements Seattle’s existing pipeline.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index declined 1.5% over the last five trading sessions.

3132,CELG,"Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (INFI  -  Free Report) provided an update on  lead pipeline candidate-IPI-549 and also issued financial guidance for 2018.Infinity is currently focused on the development of its lead immuno-oncology candidate IPI-549. It is an orally administered treatment that selectively inhibits phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)-gamma. Infinity has a clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) to evaluate IPI-549 in combination with the latter’s PD-1 immunecheckpoint inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab), in patients with advanced solid tumors.In January 2018, the company has announced the achievement of four development milestones for IPI-549. In 2018, the company also plans to report data from the monotherapy expansion and combination dose escalation components. The company expects to announce initial data from the combination expansion component of the Phase I/Ib study of IPI-549 with Opdivo in the second quarter of 2018. In the second half of 2018, Infinity expects to report more mature clinical data from the combination expansion component of the study including translational insights from paired tumor biopsies across multiple diseases.The company also announced the expansion of its phase I/Ib study of IPI-549 to include a combination cohort of IPI-549 plus Opdivo that will enroll patients with high baseline levels of myeloid derived suppressor cells. IPI-549 represents a potentially complementary approach to restoring anti-tumor immunity in combination with other immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. If successfully developed, approval of IPI-549 will provide a massive boost to Infinity’s portfolio.The company also provided financial guidance for 2018 and expects to end 2018 with a year-end cash and investments balance ranging from $10-$20 million.Based on its current operational plans, Infinity expects that its existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2017, will be adequate to satisfy the company's capital needs into the first quarter of 2019.In October 2016, Infinity entered into a license agreement with Verastem, Inc. under which it granted exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize its oncology candidate duvelisib to the latter. In October 2017, Infinity received $6-million cash payment from Verastem. Verastem plans to submit a new drug application for duvelisib in the first quarter of 2018.Infinity’s progress with the candidate has been impressive. Moreover, clinical trial collaboration with Bristol-Myers has provided Infinity with a strong partner with expertise in the field of immuno-oncology. Further, it will allow Infinity to expedite the development of IPI-549.However, Infinity faces stiff competition in the fields of immuno-oncology from companies like Bristol-Myers, AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche and Eli Lilly among others.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3133,CELG,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for sales. J&J announced its fourth-quarter results on Jan 23 before markets opened.As expected, J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year backed by higher sales in the Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 4.2% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter, better than 3.8% increase seen in the third quarter and 2.4% in the first half.Meanwhile, the acceleration in underlying sales growth in J&J’s Pharma segment seen in the third quarter continued in the fourth quarter.  Pharmaceutical segment sales rose 17.6% year over year in the fourth quarter to $9.7 billion. Also the drug and medical device giant issued a bullish profit outlook for 2018. J&J estimated 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00 - $8.20, reflecting an operational growth rate between 6.8% and 9.6%. The company’s guidance exceeded the then Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.86 per share.Despite all these positive factors, shares of J&J have declined since the earnings release on what seems to be investor disappointment with the 2018 revenue guidance.In 2018, J&J expects revenues in the range of $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion, reflecting operational constant currency sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. However, the sales guidance fell slightly short of the then Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.55 billion. Organic sales growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, is expected to be in the range of 2.5%-3.5%, which, though slightly higher than 2.4% seen in 2017, is short of 4.2% recorded in the fourth quarter. The organic sales growth outlook fell short of investor expectation, which resulted in the share price drop.We understand investors’ concern with the projected decline in revenue growth in 2018. However, we do believe that this outlook is conservative, considering that J&J has a history of issuing a cautious outlook, especially at the beginning of the year. We believe that there are several tailwinds this year, which can coax it to improve the projection as the year progresses. Two new drugs were approved last year - Guselkumab/Tremfya in the United States as well as in the EU for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States. Juluca is under review in the EU.J&J also gained FDA approval for several line extensions -  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug, Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive sales higher in 2018. The newly approved products will also contribute to sales in 2018.In 2017, J&J also submitted regulatory applications for label expansion of key drugs including Darzalex (in first-line setting for multiple myeloma), Xarelto (for chronic coronary artery disease and/or peripheral artery disease), Invokana (to include the cardiovascular indication), Zytiga (for earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer). It might get FDA nod for these line extensions this year, which can provide top-line support, if launched.This year J&J expects to file for approval of depression candidate, esketamine while apalutamide for pre-metastatic prostate cancer and Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for HIV, could be approved by the FDA. Also, several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018.Meanwhile, J&J’s Pharma segment sales accelerated in the second half from a weak first half and management seemed confident that the positive trend will continue in 2018. J&J also said on the call that the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve in 2018.We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from acquisitions, mainly Actelion, will support top-line growth.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3134,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) reported encouraging fourth-quarter 2017 results wherein both earnings and sales topped expectations.The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.00 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.95, up from $1.61 in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues grew 16.7% to $3.48 billion in the quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.47 billion. Revenues were boosted by consistent performance of the company’s key growth driver, Revlimid.Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteRevlimid – A Key CatalystNet product sales increased 17% year over year to $3.48 billion. Net sales of Revlimid came in at $2.2 billion, reflecting 21% year-over-year growth. The drug performed well in the United States (up 24%). Growth in the quarter was driven by increased volume as a result of increases in duration of treatment and market share.Net sales of another cancer drug, Abraxane decreased 6% to $251 million as sales declined the United States. Sales of oncology drug, Pomalyst/Imnovid, came in at $442 million, up 17%. Sales were driven by increased volume due to increases in market share and duration.Otezla reported sales of $371 million in the quarter, up 22%.All other product sales (including Istodax, Thalomid, Vidaza and an authorized generic version of Vidaza in the United States) totaled $227 million in the quarter, up from $220 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted research and development expenses increased 13.8% to $766 million due to increased spending related to drug discovery and clinical trial activity while adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 28.9% to $687 million.Earlier in the week, Celgene announced that it will acquire Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  for $87 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. The former already owns approximately 9.7% of outstanding shares of Juno.  Celgene also announced that it will acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline. In December 2017, Celgene and partner bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) presented updated data from the phase I trial evaluating bb2121 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The candidate was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA and PRIority MEdicines eligibility by the European Medicines Agency. The companies also initiated the KarMMa trial evaluating bb2121 in RRMM was initiated.2017 ResultsSales came in $13.0 billion, up from $11.3 billion in 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.98 billion.  Earnings per share came in at $7.44 in 2017, up from $5.94 in 2016 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.37.2018 OutlookCelgene anticipates earnings in the range of $8.70-$8.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $8.78 per share.  Net revenues are projected to be in the range of $14.4-$14.8 billion, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $14.90 billion.Revlimid sales are projected around $9.4 billion. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.9 billion. Otezla sales are now projected at $1.5 billion.Our TakeCelgene’s fourth-quarter results were encouraging as the company beat on both sales and earnings. While Revlimid sales were impressive yet again, Abraxane sales declined in the United States. Sales of Otezla have picked up too after a slowdown in the third quarter.Celgene’s stock has declined 21.4% in the last six months as against the industry’s loss of 0.5%. Shares of the company are up in the pre-market trading due to earnings beat. Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed. The threat of generic competition is also looming large on Revlimid which loses patent protection in 2022 forcing Celgene to look for acquisitions. The stock was hit earlier after a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) was discontinued.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017 and the announcement of Juno’s acquisition was on the same track.We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate.The CAR-T therapy space was in the spotlight in 2017 as the FDA approved the first CAR-T therapy, Kymriah for the treatment of patients upto 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse stage. Given the immense potential of the therapy, Celgene too wants to go the Gilead way.Zacks RankCelgene is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.

(BLUE  -  Free Report), went up almost 17.9% after the company along with its partner Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced  five  months of  follow-up  data from the ongoing phase I study (n=21) of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy candidate- bb2121. The open-label phase I CRB-401 study is evaluating the preliminary safety and efficacy of bb2121 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The study also aims to identify a dose to use in phase II studies.So far this year, bluebird’s shares have skyrocketed 227%, compared with the industry’s gain of 3%. As of the cutoff date of Oct 2, 2017, 21 patients had been enrolled patients and dosed in the dose-escalation phase of the study in four dose cohorts. The patients in the study were heavily pre-treated and had failed on a median of seven prior lines.Of the 18 patients in the active dose cohorts of the study, 94% achieved an objective response (OR). 56% patients achieved a complete response compared with the CR rate of 27% as shown in the data released at ASCO in June this year. The increase in CR rate from the previous update led to the increase in share price.The study also showed that nine out of ten (90%) of patients evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) status were found to be MRD-negative. The study did not reach the median progression free survival (PFS) with median follow up of 40 weeks in active dose cohorts. These encouraging data and the deepening response showed by bb2121 in the study bode well for the candidate and if approved can prove to be a groundbreaking CAR-T therapy in multiple myeloma. However bluebird’s competitor Juno Therapeutics, Inc.   released additional data from the TRANSCEND  phase I study on its CAR-T candidate JCAR017 (in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The TRANSCEND trial demonstrated that in a high risk patient population, 74% of patients achieved an overall response rate while and 68% achieved CR rate at 3 months.We also note that another company Gilead Sciences Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR-T therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), was approved by the FDA in October for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Yescarta is the first CAR-T therapy approved by the FDA for this indication.We also note that Novartis breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) received FDA approval for the treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse.bluebird bio, Inc.

3136,CELG,"Shares of Bluebird Bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) were up nearly 20% in early morning trading Monday as investors responded to the company’s announcement that its CAR-T candidate, bb2121, produced encouraging results in patients with a deadly blood cancer.In a presentation at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting this weekend, representatives from Bluebird and bb2121 co-developer Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) revealed that 94% of patients with advanced forms of multiple myeloma exhibited positive responses to the therapy in a recent study. The two companies also reported that at least seven study participants were complete responders.In addition to the therapy’s unprecedented efficacy, bb2121 displayed remarkable safety data. The latest study was relatively small, but Bluebird and Celgene plan to move the therapy into a larger, pivotal-stage trial soon.If the two companies can get bb2121 on the fast-track to approval, the pair would become the third group to bring a CAR-T treatment to market. CAR-T is a newly emerging method of treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells.Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah therapy, which treats lymphoblastic leukemia, became the first approved CAR-T therapy in the world in late-August, while Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) large B-cell lymphoma regimen, Yescarta, was approved in October.Gilead acquired Yescarta when it purchased Kite Pharmaceuticals earlier this year, and now Bluebird’s CAR-T progress has many investors hopeful that it will be the latest takeover target in this space.According to a note from Goldman Sachs analysts published in response to Bluebird’s recent results, the firm has emerged as an attractive acquisition candidate because of “its innovative and leading lentiviral-based gene therapy and CAR-T cell platforms backed by positive proof of concept data, which targets large blood disorders beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease and multiple myeloma.”Goldman raised its price target for the stock to $309 from $186. This new call would represent an 80.5% gain from Friday’s close, or an additional 39.5% surge from Monday’s opening price.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

The advisory panel, which had voted 12 to 1 in favor of the safety data for Heplisav-B, had commented on the design of Dynavax's proposed post-marketing study. Based on this, the company and the FDA agreed that more time is needed to finalize key details of the post-marketing study. As a result, the FDA action date was pushed back by three months to Nov 10, 2017. The company still expects to launch Heplisav-B in the U.S. in early 2018.

3139,CELG,"Of late, the biotech sector has been thriving on a slew of deals. After all, a flurry of mergers in any sector is always encouraging. Such mergers lend control over markets, increase value and reduce costs. Needless to say, these also lead to economy of scale through sharing of resources, reduced risks owing to usage of innovative techniques as well as tax advantage.Buyouts in the biotech space that have been hogging the limelight are that of Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  and Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report), and Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Bioverativ Inc. . Celgene agreed to buy Juno Therapeutics for $9 billion or $87 a cash. Meanwhile, Sanofi agreed to acquire Bioverativ for $11.6 billion. The French company insisted on paying $105 in cash for each share purchased.In the meantime, courtesy of the new tax overhaul policy, biotech firms have been able to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars stranded overseas and pay only 8% to 15.5% tax, instead of the current 35%. This extra cash can be used for merger and acquisition activities. President Trump’s business tax plan should also benefit biotech companies. The rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed until 2019. The lower tax burden is expected to boost profits for large biotech companies (read more: Fancy Biotech Stocks on Buyout Buzz? 5 Top Picks).Play the Stellar Growth With These 2 Biotech FundsAs the biotech sector is all fired up, adding sound mutual funds having significant exposure to the said sector seems judicious.

The House had already passed a one-month spending Bill on Jan 18 to keep the government funded up until Feb 16, 2018. However, the Bill did not find much favor in the Senate and therefore could not reach the 60-vote mark to clear the Senate. The Senate adjourned without further voting for a final outcome on Thursday.The funding to keep the government funded ended on Saturday, leading to a shutdown. This shutdown stretched through Monday after lawmakers in the United States failed to reach a resolution on the issue.

3141,CELG,"Buyout speculations related to Bluebird Bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) are doing the rounds again. The rumors surfaced after biotech giant Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced a $9 billion deal to buy Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  to add the latter’s CAR-T cancer therapy to its pipeline.In fact, Bluebird’s shares were up 10.6% on Jan 22 after Celgene announced the deal to buy Juno.We remind investors that last year, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired another CAR-T therapy designer, Kite Pharma for $11.8 billion. Back then, Juno and Bluebird Bio were rumored to be hot takeover targets.CAR-T therapy is the most recent and advanced form of treating cancer. It strengthens the body’s immune system to get rid of the tumors. There are only two approved CAR-T therapies to date – Novartis’ Kymriah in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Gilead’s Yescarta for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) – leaving sufficient scope for other companies to bring in prospective therapies.Terms of the Celgene/Juno Pharma DealPer the agreement, Celgene will pay $87.00 per share in cash. The total transaction value is approximately $9 billion. The price represents a 28% premium over the closing share price of Juno as of Jan 19, 2018.The transaction was approved by shareholders of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.While shares of Juno have shot up 27%, that of Celgene have gone up 0.3% after the announcement. In fact, in the past six months, Juno’s stock has returned 186.2% against a 5% decline registered by the industry.Why Juno Therapeutics?Juno’s CAR-T therapy, JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel) for treating relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”), the most common form of NHL, will boost Celgene’s lymphoma pipeline. A regulatory approval is being anticipated for JCAR017 in 2019 and potential peak sales are expected to be approximately $3 billion.Data from the phase I study, TRANSCEND, announced last month, demonstrated that at dose level 2, 74% of the patients with the aforementioned indication showed an overall response rate (ORR) and 68% complete response (“CR”) rate at three months in core group.The acquisition will also add another CAR-T candidate, JCARH125, to Celgene’s pipeline, which is being developed for multiple myeloma.Bluebird Bio in FocusCAR-T therapy represents immense potential at this juncture, thereby attracting the attention of big pharmas. Thus, following the acquisition of Kite Pharma and Juno, investors are anticipating a buyout offer for Bluebird, which has already started rallying on rumors.Bluebird is developing its anti B-cell maturation antigen CAR T-cell therapy, bb2121, in a dose-ranging phase I study. Five months of follow-up data announced in December 2017 demonstrated that among the 18 patients treated with bb2121 in active dose arm, 94% achieved an objective response (OR) while 56% patients achieved a complete response. The encouraging data and the deepening response showed by bb2121 in the study bode well for the candidate. Shares of the company are up 95.5% in the past six months.The candidate is being developed in collaboration with Celgene. However, with acquisition of Juno, Celgene is less likely to bid for Bluebird. But there are several other big pharma companies with a large cash pile who may be interested in Bluebird.The Celgene/Juno deal has also led to a rally in stocks of other CAR-T therapy focused companies, including Fate Therapeutics, ZIOPHARM Oncology and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals.Bluebird carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3142,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that it will acquire Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  for $87 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. The former already owns approximately 9.7% of outstanding shares of Juno.Details of the AgreementThe transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Celgene expects to fund the transaction through a combination of existing cash and new debt.  The acquisition is expected to dilute the company’s bottom line in 2018 by approximately 50 cents and is expected to be incrementally additive to net product sales in 2020.Strategic Value of the AcquisitionThe acquisition is expected to position Celgene as a prominent company in the cellular immunotherapy space. Juno focuses on the development of CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T and TCR (T cell receptor) therapeutics with a promising pipeline evaluating multiple targets and cancer indications. The acquisition will add JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to Celgene’s lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  The candidate is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the United States in 2019 with potential global peak sales of approximately $3 billion. Other candidate include JCARH125 for multiple myelomaCelgene already has a collaboration and investment agreement with Juno for the development and commercialization of immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases. We remind investors that Celgene and Juno entered into a strategic collaboration in June 2015 whereby the companies will leverage T cell therapeutic strategies to develop treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases with an initial focus on CAR-T and TCR technologies. Celgene exercised its option to develop and commercialize the Juno CD19 program outside North America and China in April 2016.Our TakeCelgene is on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017. We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate. Celgene’s stock has tumbled 8.6% over a year as against the industry’s gain of 10.3%. Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed. The threat of generic competition is also looming large on Revlimid which loses patent protection in 2022 forcing Celgene to look for acquisitions.In January 2018, Celgene announced to acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Fedratinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary endpoints of splenic response and total symptom score, respectively in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III pivotal trial (JAKARTA-1) for treatment-naïve MF.The CAR-T therapy space was in the spotlight in 2017 as the FDA approved the first CAR-T therapy, Kymriah for the treatment of patients upto 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse stage.Given the immense potential of the therapy, Celgene too wants to go the Gilead way.  Meanwhile, Celgene also has a partnership with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) for CAR-T therapy candidates.However, the acquisition of Juno might be a risky proposition for Celgene.  Juno has faced setbacks with its pipeline candidate, JCAR015. In July 2016, Juno suffered a huge setback with the FDA placing a clinical hold on the company’s phase II study (ROCKET) on JCAR015 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). The hold was placed after two patients died within a week due to severe neurotoxicity following the addition of fludarabine to the pre-conditioning regimen. While the hold was lifted a week later and the study resumed under a revised protocol, the company voluntarily placed the study on hold again in November 2016 after two patients suffered cerebral edema. Subsequently, in March 2017, Juno announced that it has discontinued the development of the candidate. Moreover, the price of $87 per share represents a huge premium from Juno’s share price of $45.60 when the rumors of the acquisition had surfaced.The biotech sector is likely to see a lot happening in the M&A front in 2018 given a dull 2017.Zacks RankCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3143,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced positive results from a late-stage study on oncology drug, Abraxane, in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq.The study was sponsored by Roche. IMpassion130, a phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, is evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Tecentriq in combination with Abraxane compared to placebo in combination with Abraxane, in patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have not received prior systemic therapy for the disease.The study met its co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), as the results show that Tecentriq and Abraxane significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) in patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced TNBC in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1 positive population as an initial (first-line) treatment. Overall survival is encouraging in the PD-L1 positive population at this interim analysis, and follow up will continue until the next planned analysis.Results from the study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.Notably, this is the third positive phase III study to demonstrate a clinical benefit with Tecentriq plus Abraxane as part of a treatment regimen. The other studies in the program evaluated the experimental combination in non-small cell lung cancer patients.Positive data from these studies demonstrate the potential role of Abraxane as a preferred chemotherapy partner for immunotherapy combinations.We remind investors that Celgene is currently working on the label expansion of drugs like Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla among others, which is encouraging. Abraxane is currently in various stages of evaluation for breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The drug maintained its dominant market share in the United States for the indication of pancreatic cancer, first-line advanced NSCLC and metastatic breast cancer, despite competitive pressure in the lung and breast cancer markets.Label expansion of drugs bode well for Celgene as it makes desperate attempts to revamp its portfolio, given the recent pipeline setbacks. The company suffered a setback in early 2018, when it received Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for multiple sclerosis candidate, ozanimod.  A late-stage study on its lead cancer drug, Revlimid, in combination with Rituxan failed. Consequently, shares took a hammering.Shares of Celgene are down 19.9% in the year so far compared to a 2.8% decline for the overall biotech industry. Nevertheless, Celgene has a few promising candidates in its pipeline, which should boost prospects.Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics and added JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to its lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T candidate, currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The candidate is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the United States in 2019 with potential global peak sales of approximately $3 billion. Another promising candidate is bb2121, an experimental anti-B-cell maturation antigen chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in collaboration with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report).Most recently, Celgene and partner Acceleron Pharma Inc. (XLRN  -  Free Report) announced back to back positive results from two late-stage studies on pipeline candidate, luspatercept.Zacks Rank  Celgene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3144,CELG,"Positive data released by bigwig Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) from a mid-stage study for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease created a stir in the biotech sector last week. Among other news, Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) reported positive data on a key pipeline candidate from a late-stage study while Axovant (AXON  -  Free Report) gained on yet another licensing deal.Recap of Important Stories:Biogen Soars on Positive Alzheimer’s Study Results: Shares of Biogen soared after the company reported encouraging top-line results from a mid-stage study on pipeline candidate BAN2401 for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). BAN2401, an anti-amyloid beta protofibril antibody, was being evaluated in a phase II study for AD. Biogen is developing BAN2401, a humanized beta amyloid antibody, in collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd. The candidate is being investigated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid. Top-line results of the final analysis of the phase II study (n=856) demonstrated statistically significant slowing of disease progression on the key clinical endpoint (ADCOMS) after 18 months of treatment in patients receiving the highest treatment dose (10 mg/kg biweekly) of BAN2401 as compared to placebo. Meanwhile, treatment with this high dose for 18 months also led to reduction of amyloid beta accumulated in the brain. (Read more: Biogen's Alzheimer Disease Candidate Succeeds in Phase II).The positive results gave investors much reason to cheer as AD has always been a challenging market given the spate of study failures in recent times. So, the abovementioned results are deemed as important breakthrough by Biogen and Eisai in the AD market, raising hopes for a possible cure. Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(XLRN  -  Free Report) reported positive results from a second randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical phase III study, BELIEVE, on pipeline candidate, luspatercept. The results show that luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of erythroid response, which was defined as at least a 33% reduction from baseline in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden with a reduction of at least 2 units during the protocol-defined period of 12 consecutive weeks (from week 13 to week 24) compared to placebo. Moreover, luspatercept also met all key secondary endpoints of demonstrating statistically significant improvements in RBC transfusion burden from baseline of at least a 33% reduction during the period from week 37 to week 48.  Notably, this is the second positive phase III study for the candidate. Last month, both companies announced positive results from another phase III study, MEDALIST, wherein luspatercept met the primary and key secondary endpoints compared to placebo in patients with IPSS-R very low, low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with chronic anaemia. A third study, BEYOND, is also ongoing and evaluating luspatercept in non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia. (Read more: Celgene, Acceleron Report Positive Data on Thalassemia Drug).Meanwhile, Celgene also announced positive results from a phase III study, IMpassion130, wherein the experimental combination of Roche’s immuno-oncology drug Tecentriq plus Abraxane by the former compared with Abraxane monotherapy, significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) in patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced triple negative breast cancer. Axovant Gains on Yet Another Gene Therapy Deal: Axovant Sciences’ shares gained after it announced a licensing agreement with Benitec Biopharma. Per the agreement, Axovant licensed exclusive global rights to an experimental Silence-and-Replace gene therapy program from Benitec Biopharma for the treatment of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). Axovant will obtain rights to AXO-AAV-OPMD, which will utilize proprietary Silence-and-Replace technology. AXO-AAV-OPMD is an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene therapy delivered via a one-time intramuscular administration, which both silences the mutant PABPN1 gene and replaces it with a functional copy. It is currently in preclinical development stage. Axovant plans to initiate a placebo-controlled clinical study in 2019. The candidate enjoys orphan drug status in both the United States and Europe for the treatment of OPMD.  Both companies have also entered into a research collaboration for the development of five additional gene therapy products in neurological disorders.  The agreement with Benitec will bolster Axovant’s pipeline of innovative gene therapies for serious neurological diseases.

3145,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell.Celgene’s stock has tumbled 9.3% in the last year compared with the industry’s gain of 7.4%.Celgene has an excellent track record with the company beating earnings estimates in the last four trailing quarters. Last quarter, the company topped estimates by 1.6%. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 2.5%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Celgene is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.94%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Revlimid to Drive GrowthEarlier in the month, Celgene released preliminary results for 2017. The company expects earnings per share (EPS) of around $7.44 in 2017, up 25% year over year. Operating margin is anticipated around 58.1%. For the fourth quarter, EPS is anticipated to be around $2.00, a 24% increase year over year. Operating margin is expected to be around 55.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the fourth quarter is $1.94 and $7.37 for 2017.Total revenues are expected around $3.5 billion in fourth-quarter 2017 and $13.0 billion in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $3.50 billion for the fourth quarter and $13 billion for 2017. Revlimid revenues are expected around $2.2 billion in the fourth-quarter and $8.2 billion for 2017.Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma. The drug performed well in the first nine months of 2017 and combated the challenges of uneven buying patterns and coverage gap. Market share gains in key markets and longer treatment duration are contributing to the drug’s growth.Continued momentum in the core indication, label expansion and global launches should help the product to keep contributing to the top line. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Revlimid currently stands at $2.2 billion for the fourth quarter.Pomalyst revenues are expected around $442 million and $1.6 billion in 2017. Pomalyst/Imnovid is being evaluated in multiple combination studies in relapsed/refractory MM. The drug’s label was updated in the United States and the Europe to include data from a pooled pharmacokinetics analysis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM and impaired renal function which should boost sales.Otezla revenues are expected around $371 million in the fourth quarter and $1.3 billion in 2017. The deep and persistent slowing growth of the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis markets, especially during the entire third quarter led to weak performance of Otezla in the quarter which should impact sales in the fourth quarter also. Abraxane revenues are around $251 million in the fourth quarter and $992 million in 2017.Meanwhile, the approval of Idhifa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML (R/R AML) will further boost Celgene’s portfolio. The drug was developed in collaboration with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO  -  Free Report).Celgene is on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given the recent setbacks.  In January 2018, Celgene announced it will acquire Impact Biomedicines. The company recently announced that it will acquire smaller biotech Juno Therapeutics  whose pipeline includes CD19 and CD22 directed CAR-T cell product candidates for $9 billion.During fourth-quarter earnings call investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on recent acquisitions.Stock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.90% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to release fourth-quarter results on Jan 31. You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here..  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3146,CELG,"2017 was a good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much-awaited recovery.A key reason for the sector’s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus more on fundamentals instead. Although the drug pricing controversy, which was a major overhang in 2016, will remain a headline risk, investors seem more comfortable with the issue. Moreover, a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 has restored investor confidence in the sector. The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough for the sector.Hopes of more mergers and acquisitions (M&As) have also gone up with tax reform in place and big players on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines/technology. There has already been quite a bit of M&A buzz this year about potential deals with Celgene rumored to be interested in buying Juno , Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) in Acorda and Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) in Bioverativ. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk recently confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx though Ablynx rejected Novo Nordisk’s offer.Looking forward, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, continued strong performance from key products, more M&A activity, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the momentum in 2018.Headwinds include drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, the growing presence of biosimilars, generic competition, a slowdown in the growth of legacy products, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena and major pipeline setbacks.4 Biotech & Pharma Stocks to Keep an Eye on This Earnings SeasonAccording to the Zacks Earnings Trends article, the medical sector, which has been among the better performing sectors over the last several quarters, is expected to record earnings growth of 3% on revenue growth of 4.7% in the fourth quarter.Given this scenario and with medical sector earnings round the corner, it would make sense to look at some pharma and biotech stocks that are expected to report a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Investing in such stocks could prove beneficial for investors as an earnings beat usually leads to significant share price appreciation.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed-in on four pharma and biotech stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP. Earnings ESP is a very valuable tool for investors looking for stocks that are most likely to beat earnings estimates. Moreover, adding a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 has produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.

Likewise, selling, general and administrative expenses were up 16.5% to $14.1 million. In fact, the increase in operating expenses was primarily owing to greater compensation expense and increase in spending on CORT125134, CORT118335, and CORT125281 along with other pharmacy costs.Pipeline UpdateCorcept continues to enroll patients for phase II study of CORT125134 for Cushing’s syndrome.  The phase II results are expected in the first quarter of 2018.

3148,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) reported encouraging first-quarter 2018 results wherein both earnings and sales topped expectations.The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.05 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.00, up from $1.67 in the year-ago quarter.Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteTotal revenues grew 19.4% to $3.54 billion in the quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.50 billion. Revenues were boosted by consistent performance of the company’s key growth driver, Revlimid.Revlimid — Key CatalystNet product sales increased 20% year over year to $3.5 billion. Net sales of Revlimid came in at $2.2 billion, reflecting 19% year-over-year growth. The drug performed well both in the United States (up 21%) and international markets (up 15%). Growth in the quarter was driven by increased volume as a result of increases in duration of treatment and market share.Net sales of another cancer drug, Abraxane increased 11% to $262 million as sales benefited from buying patterns.  Pomalyst/Imnovid came in at $453 million, up 24%. Sales were driven by increased volume due to increase in market share and duration.Otezla sales were $353 million in the quarter, up 46%. Sales in the United States were primarily volume-driven due to increasing demand and improved access pull-through in contracted health plans while sales in international markets were driven primarily by increasing adoption in key ex-U.S. markets.All other product sales (including Istodax, Thalomid, Vidaza and an authorized generic version of Vidaza in the United States) totaled $229 million in the quarter, up from $226 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted research and development expenses increased 16.6% to $694 million due to higher spending related to drug discovery and clinical trial activity while adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 24.5% to $671 million.Pipeline UpdateCelgene acquired acquire Juno Therapeutics, Inc. for approximately $9 billion in March 2018. In February 2018, the company also acquired Impact Biomedicines and added a late stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to its pipeline.Celgene announced a global collaboration with Prothena (PRTA  -  Free Report) in March 2018 to develop new therapies for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases primarily focused on three proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed target.Celgene's partner bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) opted to co-develop and co-promote bb2121, an experimental anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of patients with RRMM in the United States in March 2018. Both companies had originally entered into a broad, global strategic research collaboration in 2013 to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies in oncology, which included bb2121. The agreement was amended in 2015.However, Celgene suffered a setback when it received a Refusal To File letter from the FDA regarding the New Drug Application (NDA) for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Celegne now plans to resubmit the NDA in the first quarter of 2019 following a Type A meeting with the FDA in early April. The company also plans to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for ozanimod in RMS in the first quarter of 2019.2018 Outlook UpdatedCelgene now anticipates earnings per share of $8.45 in 2018 compared to the earlier estimate of $8.70-$8.90. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $8.44 per share.  Net revenues are now estimated around $14.8 billion, at the high end of the previously projected range of $14.4-$14.8 billion, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $14.84 billion. The numbers include the impact of dilution from the Juno acquisition.Revlimid sales are now projected at $9.5 billion, up from $9.4 billion estimated earlier. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. Pomalyst’s revenues are now projected at around $2.0 billion (previous projection: $1.9 billion). Otezla sales continued to be projected at $1.5 billion.Our TakeCelgene’s first-quarter results were encouraging as the company beat on both sales and earnings. Revlimid sales were impressive yet again along with Pomalyst and Otezla.The results come as a breather for investors who bore the brunt of the decline in share price due to series of setbacks over the last few months. Celgene’s stock has lost 16% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 12.6%. Nevertheless, shares of the company are up in the pre-market trading due to an earnings beat.Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed. The threat of generic competition is also looming large on Revlimid which loses patent protection in 2022 forcing Celgene to look for acquisitions. The stock was hit earlier after a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) was discontinued. The company also suffered a setback with its RMS candidate, ozanimod.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017 and the Juno acquisition was on the same track. We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate.Zacks RankCelgene is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

3149,CELG,"The biotech corner of the broad healthcare sector is in the spotlight to start the New Year, as the new tax legislation has enticed U.S. companies to bring offshore cash back home, sparking waves of mergers and acquisitions. Additionally, the slower growth in mature drugs has compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines.Deals on “Wheels”Celgene Corp (CELG  -  Free Report) has been at the forefront to join the M&A craze. The company announced a deal to acquire blood-disease biotechnology company Impact Biomedicines for as much as $7 billion. The deal, expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, will add a new drug fedratinib, which is a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor being evaluated across 18 clinical trials, including a Phase III trial, for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera to Celegne’s pipeline (read: Value Biotech ETFs to Buy Now).Now, CELG is rumored to be in talks to acquire smaller rival Juno Therapeutics Inc.  in a quest to bolster its blood-cancer drug portfolio before its best-selling drug, Revlimid, loses patent protection. The acquisition could strengthen Celgene's drug pipeline for blood cancer, and potentially broaden its treatments to include lung, breast and ovarian cancers. Since both CELG and JUNO have long partnered on cancer treatments including the promising CAR-T drugs that teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer, the talks could lead to a deal in the coming weeks.Among other deals, Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical has agreed to acquire Belgian biotech group TiGenix for 520 million euros ($628 million) aimed at strengthening the late-stage gastroenterology pipeline and presence in the U.S. specialty care market. Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk NOVO has also made a bid of €2.6 billion ($3.1 billion) to buy Belgian biotech Ablynx to beef up its waning performance in its haematology and hormone treatments division but the latter rejected the offer.Given the flurry of deals so far, M&A activity in the biotech sector is expected to be robust this year. EY expects the deal value to exceed $200 billion, given companies’ increased financial firepower and balance sheet strength (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).ETFs in FocusThis trend has led to smooth trading in the biotech sector with Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report) stealing the show thanks to its 9.2% gains. This was followed by Virtus LifeSci Biotech Clinical Trials ETF (BBC  -  Free Report), First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund (FBT  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Portfolio (PBE  -  Free Report) that have risen 7.6%, 6.3% and 6%, respectively.Below we profile these ETFs in details and discuss some of the specifics behind their recent rally:CNCRThis product tracks the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Index and provides exposure to the basket of 30 companies that develop therapies to treat cancer by harnessing the body’s own immune system.

3150,CELG,"Shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $148.32 on Jan 17 and eventually closed the day at $146.98. The stock hit the new high probably on a Reuters news which states that some Chinese bidders are planning to buy a J&J’s diabetes care unit in the country in a deal which could be worth $4 billionAs it is, J&J stock has had a great run in the past year. Shares of J&J have rallied 28.1% over a year while the industry has registered an increase of 21.5%. Promising data from several pivotal studies and rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions over a year kept the stock on a growth trajectory. This positive trend is likely to continue in 2018 as well.The company received approvals for two new drugs last year — Guselkumab/Tremfyain the United Statesas well as in the EU for plaque psoriasisand thefirst dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine)in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States. Juluca is under review in the EU.J&J also received FDA approval for several line extensions —  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. Investors should note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive sales.Sales of the company’s Pharma segment accelerated in the third quarter and  the trend is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well asin 2018. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelaraand Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions — mainly Actelion — will support top-line growth. This year J&J expects to file for approval of depression candidate, esketaminewhile apalutamidefor pre-metastatic prostate cancerand Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for HIVcould be approved by the FDA.With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is likely to continue in 2018. Johnson & Johnson Price Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson Quote Zacks Rank J&J has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3151,CELG,"Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the phase III study, MURANO.The study evaluated Venclexta in combination with Rituxan in patients suffering from relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Data showed that the study met its primary endpoint as the results depicted a statistically significant improvement in the time patients lived without their disease progressing or progression-free survival (PFS), when treated with Venclexta plus Rituxan compared to Treanda plus Rituxan.We note that Roche is developing Venclexta in collaboration with AbbVie, Inc (ABBV  -  Free Report). Both the companies are commercializing the drug in the United States while AbbVie will commercialize outside the country.We remind investors that the FDA approved Venclexta in April 2016 for the treatment of people with CLL, who have received at least one prior therapy, with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA-approved test. The FDA also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Venclexta in combination with Rituxan for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL based on promising results from the phase Ib M13-365 study.The company is conducting MURANO study to convert the current accelerated approval of Venclexta to a full approval. Data from this study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to global health authorities.As per estimates, there will be more than 20,000 new cases of CLL diagnosed in the United States in 2017. CLL is the most common type of adult leukemia. Hence, a potential approval for this indication will boost sales potential.Roche’s hematology portfolio includes approved drugs like MabThera/Rituxan, Gazyva, Tecentriq, and Venclexta along with pipeline candidates, polatuzumab vedotin/RG7596) and a small molecule antagonist of MDM2 (idasanutlin/RG7388).Last week, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on a phase Ib and phase I/II b trials evaluating immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq due to safety issues. A partial hold was put due to emerging safety data from clinical trials evaluating Merck & Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in combination with Celgene Corp.’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid and Pomalyst. We note that the FDA had put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program by Celgene. Roche’s stock has gained 13.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 19.4% in the year so far.Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market. The company dominates the breast cancer space due to the strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline. Generic competition for Xeloda continues to hurt sales. Competition from biosimilars looms large on Roche's key drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3152,CELG,"Prothena Corporation plc (PRTA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8.Prothena Corporation plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Prothena Corporation plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Prothena Corporation plc Quote In the last reported quarter, the company incurred a narrower-than-expected loss resulting in a positive earnings surprise of 13.9%.  Notably, Prothena’s track record has been decent so far. The company reported a narrower-than-expected loss in all of the last trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 22.5%.   Prothena’s shares have lost 78.7% in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 12.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Pipeline Progress in FocusProthena’s top line primarily comprises collaboration revenues earned through its license, development and commercialization agreements. In fact, the company earns collaboration revenues mainly under its license agreement with Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for PRX002.We expect investors focus to remain on pipeline updates as the company has no approved product in its portfolio.Prothena has discontinued the development of its lead pipeline candidate, NEOD001. The candidate, an antibody, was being evaluated for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. A phase IIb study, PRONTO, did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Hence, the company asked the independent data monitoring committee (“DMC”) of the phase III VITAL study to review a futility analysis of the ongoing VITAL study. Thereafter, the DMC recommended discontinuation of the VITAL study.Hence, the company decided to discontinue all studies for the development of NEOD001, including the VITAL study as well as the open label extension studies. The decision came as a major blow to the investors as the company has a very limited number of candidates in its pipeline and NEOD001 was a lead candidate.Moreover, disappointing results from a phase Ib multiple ascending dose study of pipeline candidate, PRX003 in psoriasis patients was another setback for the company. The primary objectives of the study were achieved. However, advancing PRX003 into mid-stage clinical development required a well-defined relationship between biological activity and meaningful clinical effects and these prerequisites were not met.As a result, investors will focus on PRX002. Prothena is evaluating PRX002, in collaboration with Roche for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies. The company initiated a phase II study, PASADENA, in patients suffering from Parkinson`s disease in second-quarter 2017.The initiation triggered a $30-million milestone from Roche to Prothena.The company has also collaborated with Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) to develop new therapies for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases. The multi-year agreement is focused on three proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed target.Like any other development-stage biotechnology company, Prothena is likely to see an increase in research and development expenses due to higher spending on pipeline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model doesn’t show that Prothena is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat on earnings. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $1.23. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Prothena currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is one health care stock that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report) is expected to report quarterly results on May 8. The company has an Earnings ESP of +8.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.   You can see see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

3153,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) and partner Acceleron Pharma Inc. (XLRN  -  Free Report) announced positive results from a second randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical phase III study, BELIEVE, on pipeline candidate, luspatercept.The trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of luspatercept, in addition to best supportive care as compared to placebo plus best supportive care in adults with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia.The results show that luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of erythroid response, which was defined as at least a 33% reduction from baseline in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden with a reduction of at least 2 units during the protocol-defined period of 12 consecutive weeks (from week 13 to week 24) compared to placebo.Moreover, luspatercept also met all key secondary endpoints of demonstrating statistically significant improvements in RBC transfusion burden from baseline of at least a 33% reduction during the period from week 37 to week 48. Treatment with the candidate also showed at least a 50% reduction during the period from week 13 to week 24 and at least a 50% reduction during the period from week 37 to week 48. It also demonstrated a mean change in transfusion burden from week 13 to week 24.Notably, this is the second positive phase III study for the candidate. Last month, both the companies announced positive results from another phase III study, MEDALIST, wherein luspatercept met the primary and key secondary endpoints compared to placebo in patients with IPSS-R very low, low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with chronic anemia and refractory to, intolerant of, or ineligible for treatment with an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA), ring sideroblast-positive, and require frequent RBC transfusions.Data from both the studies will be submitted to a future medical meeting in 2018. Both the companies intend to submit regulatory applications for luspatercept in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2019.A third study is also ongoing, BEYOND, which is evaluating luspatercept in non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia.The successful development and commercialization of luspatercept bode well for Celgene as it makes desperate attempts to revamp its portfolio, given the recent pipeline setbacks. The company suffered a setback in early 2018, when it received Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for multiple sclerosis candidate, ozanimod.  A late-stage study on its lead cancer drug, Revlimid, in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan failed. Consequently, shares took a hammering.Shares of Celgene are down 19.6% in the year so far compared to a 2.7% decline for the overall biotech industry. Nevertheless, Celgene has a few promising candidates in its pipeline, which should boost prospects. Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics and added JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to its lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T candidate, currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.The candidate is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the United States in 2019 with potential global peak sales of approximately $3 billion. Another promising candidate is bb2121, an experimental anti-B-cell maturation antigen chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in collaboration with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank  Celgene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3154,CELG,"CTI BioPharma Corp.

However, shares of the company have rallied 67.2% so far this year, against the industry’s gain of 2.9%.The pivotal PIX306 study compared Pixuvri and Rituxan combination regimen with the combination of chemo drug, gemcitabine, and Rituxan for the treatment of aggressive B-cell NHL, a form of blood cancer, in patients whose disease relapsed following CHOP-R chemotherapy. Data from the study showed that patients treated with Pixuvri regimen failed to achieve improvement in progression free survival compared to patients treated with gemcitabine regimen.However, the company has plans to conduct a thorough review of the data from the study. CTI BioPharma expects to submit data from PIX306 study to the European Medicines Agency for review by the end of 2018.Pixuvri has conditional approval in Europe as monotherapy for the treatment of multiply relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL. However, it is yet to receive approval in the United States.There are approximately 168,000 newly diagnosed NHL patients every year in the United States and Europe. Several companies are developing drugs for the treatment for the disease. A few of them are developing the most advanced form of cancer treatment, CAR-T therapy, for treating NHL, which includes Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) lisocabtagene.The disappointing data from the PIX306 study negatively impacts Pixuvri’s prospects in an already competitive market.CTI BioPharma Corp.

3155,CELG,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) was a star performer in Friday’s trading session, as the stock rallied as much as 23.1% but closed a little lower, rising 19.6% in the day’s trade. The massive gain for the biotech firm came from encouraging Phase 2 clinical study data for Alzheimer’s treatment.The final analysis at 18 months of the 856-patient Phase 2 clinical study of BAN2401 in early Alzheimer’s disease demonstrated statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline and reduction of amyloid beta accumulated in the brain, per the company press release. Amyloid beta or protein fragments are found in the brains of patients suffering from the disease and that some believe cause it.Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia and affects about 50 million people worldwide, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. Currently, there is no treatment for the disease or way to stop its progression. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved some medications to treat symptoms related to memory loss, language and other thought processes (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).As such, the result marks an important milestone in the companies' quest to tackle Alzheimer's disease. In fact, analysts welcomed the news as the first trial study for the drug was disappointing. This resulted in a risk-on environment, with many investors pulling in capital to this high growth and high beta sector.Other large-cap biotech stocks also gained with Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) up 3.3%, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) up 2.5% and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) up 1.9%. This suggests that investors are pinning their hopes on these fast growing companies, which could see smooth trading in the coming days.ETF ImpactThe smooth trading in the stock world also sent biotech ETFs space into green on the day. In particular, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) stole the show climbing 3.8% o, followed by more than 3% gains each for First Trust Amex Biotechnology Index (FBT  -  Free Report), Invesco Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome ETF (PBE  -  Free Report) and VanEck Vectors Biotech ETF (BBH  -  Free Report).IBBThis fund provides exposure to 192 firms by tracking the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, with Biogen taking the top spot at 9.1%.

It holds about 30 securities in its basket with Biogen occupying the fifth position at 4.1% share and charges 56 bps in annual fees. It has accumulated $1.7 billion in its asset base and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook (read: 4 Sector ETFs That Crushed S&P 500 in 9-Year Bull Run).PBEThis fund provides exposure to 31 firms by tracking the Dynamic Biotech & Genome Intellidex Index.

It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook (read: Pharma & Biotech ETFs Soar on Trump's Drug Plan).BBHThis fund offers exposure to 26 large biotechnology corporations by tracking the MVIS US Listed Biotech 25 Index. Here, Biogen is the fifth firm accounting for 5.8% share. BBH has amassed $427.6 million in its asset base and charges 35 bps in fees per year. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a High risk outlook.What Lies Ahead?The uptrend in the sector is likely to continue this year on tax reform, rising M&A and positive regulatory backdrop (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs to Buy for Q3).The new tax legislation has enticed large pharmaceutical companies to bring offshore cash back home at reduced tax rates of 8-15.5% instead of the prior 35%. The repatriated money led to an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity, share buybacks and dividends. Additionally, the slower growth in mature drugs has also compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones, even at hefty premiums, with promising pipelines.Further, Trump’s most-awaited plan to lower drug prices has added to the strength. If these were not enough, the sector’s non-cyclical nature is an advantage in the current market, which is ruffled by trade war fears between China and United States as well as geopolitical tension.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3156,CELG,"Roche Holdings AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has put a partial clinical hold on a phase Ib and phase I/II b trials evaluating Tecentriq, due to safety issues.A partial hold was put due to emerging safety data from clinical trials evaluating Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in combination with Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid and Pomalyst. We note that the FDA had put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program by Celgene.The FDA is currently evaluating all ongoing blood cancer trials investigating an anti-PD1/PDL1 drug in combination with an immunomodulatory drug in order determine if it is a class-wide (anti-PD1/PDL1) concern in multiple myeloma/blood cancers or a specific concern with certain combinations with immunomodulatory drugs.The two studies include cohorts evaluating Tecentriq in combination with an immunomodulatory medicine (IMiDs) in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma.As a result of the partial clinical hold, patients who are currently enroled in these trials and are deriving clinical benefit may continue to receive treatment, but no additional patients will be enroled.We note that the FDA granted accelerated approval to immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq in May 2016 for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Initial uptake of the drug has been encouraging. In October 2016, Tecentriq became the first and only anti-PDL1 cancer immunotherapy to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC.The FDA recently granted accelerated approval to Tecentriq for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy. The drug was previously approved for patients suffering from locally advanced or mUC who have disease progression during or following any platinum-containing chemotherapy, or within 12 months of receiving chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant).The news comes as a disappointment as label expansion of the drug will boost sales. Roche’s stock has gained 14.1% against the industry’s gain of 19.4% in the year so far. Earlier, the FDA also put a partial clinical hold on Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) three clinical trials — CA209602 (CheckMate-602), CA209039 (CheckMate-039) and CA204142 for the same reason.

3157,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program. Partial clinical hold has been put on five trials and a full clinical hold on one trial.The trials are evaluating Imfinzi (durvalumab), an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in combination with immunomodulatory and chemotherapy agents in blood cancers such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma.The FDA has placed a hold on these trials due to risks identified in other trials for an anti-PD-1 antibody, Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, in patients with multiple myeloma in combination with immunomodulatory agents.As a result, no new patients will be enroled in the trial. Nevertheless, patients enroled in the trials on partial hold and those receiving clinical benefit from the same as determined by the investigator, may remain under treatment. Patients enroled in the trial on full clinical hold will be discontinued from treatment.We remind investors that Celgene entered into a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC's (AZN  -  Free Report) MedImmune in April 2015 to develop and commercialize Imfinzi for hematologic malignancies in combination with Revlimid, Pomalyst, Vidaza and others.The trials placed on partial clinical hold are MEDI4736-MM-001, MEDI4736-MM-003, MEDI4736-MM-005, MEDI4736-NHL-001, and MEDI4736-DLBCL-001.  The trial placed on full hold include MEDI4736-MM-002.Earlier in the week, the FDA also put a partial clinical hold on Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY) three clinical trials — CA209602 (CheckMate-602), CA209039 (CheckMate-039) and CA204142 for the same reason.We note that in July 2017, the FDA placed a clinical hold on KEYNOTE-183, KEYNOTE-185 and KEYNOTE-023, three combination studies of Keytruda in multiple myeloma. The decision was taken following a review of data by the Data Monitoring Committee in which higher deaths were reported in the Keytruda arms of KEYNOTE-183 and KEYNOTE-185 leading to a halt in enrolment.The news comes as a major setback as label expansion of these drugs might have boosted Celgene’s top line.Celgene’s stock has moved up 22.5% year to date compared to the industry’s gain of 16.5%. Shares were down in pre-market trading on the news but regained ground thereafter.Meanwhile, Celgene’s Revlimid continued to outperform driven by market share increases in newly diagnosed myeloma and in treatment duration.Zacks Rank& Key PickCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Aduro Biotech, Inc.

3158,CELG,"Of late, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are investing in immuno-oncology research therapies as it remains a key area of focus, thanks to its vast growth potential. Last week, the immuno-oncology space grabbed investors’ attention with the FDA approving Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse.Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy approved. A novel immunocellular therapy and one-time treatment, Kymriah uses patient's T cells to fight cancer.While the long-term impact of the treatment is yet to be evaluated, the approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer. To start with, CAR-T uses patient’s cells to identify and destroy cancer cells, thereby making it different from other small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen.With the approval of Kymriah, investors have started to shift their focus on a number of companies which have been developing their pipeline candidates to remain afloat in the highly competitive environment.4 Stocks That Warrant a LookKite Pharma Inc.  is expected to receive approval for its CAR-T therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) shortly. The Biologics License Application for the candidate was submitted in March 2017. The application was gr priority review in the United States and the FDA is expected to give a decision on Nov 29, 2017. The candidate is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in 2018. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.Given the likely approval and potential in the space, Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) has inked a deal to acquire Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Kite Pharma’s stock has moved up 297.0% year to date, which compares favorably with a 15% increase registered by the industry. The company presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  is also developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on its CAR and high-affinity TCR technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells.  The company is currently conducting a phase I trial with JCAR017 in adult r/r aggressive NHL, including r/r DLBCL, and planning to file an IND in 2017 for a planned phase I/II trial with JCAR017 in r/r chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The company expects an approval in 2018. Shares of the company have rallied119.7% year to date. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).bluebird bio, Inc.

3159,CELG,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval to Mylotarg for adult patients with newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The drug also received approval to treat relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML in adults as well as children (2 years and older).The approval was expected as the FDA’s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee had voted in favor of Mylotarg’s approval in July 2017.However, it should be noted that the U.S. label of the drug will include a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity including severe or fatal hepatic veno-occlusive disease.Pfizer’s shares have gained 4.6% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s increase of 12.3%.The approval was granted based on data from multiple investigator-led clinical trials, including ALFA-0701, AML-19 and MyloFrance-1.The ALFA-0701 phase III study evaluated Mylotarg in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed AML patients. The drug showed significant improvement in event-free survival (EFS), achieving 17.3 months compared to 9.5 months for chemotherapy.The phase III AML-19 study compared Mylotarg as monotherapy with best supportive care in elderly AML patients who are intolerant to other therapies. Mylotarg achieved a better median overall survival period of 4.9 months versus 3.6 months for best supportive care.MyloFrance-1, a phase II study, evaluated single agent Mylotarg in relapsing AML patients. The study showed that almost 26% of patients achieved complete remission and the median relapse-free survival achieved was 11.6 months.It is evident from the above studies that Mylotarg’s achievements support its risk benefit profile in AML patients.We remind investors that Mylotarg was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in 2000 as a single agent for treating CD33-positive AML in patients who had experienced their first relapse and were 60 years or older. However, 10 years later, Pfizer voluntarily removed Mylotarg from the market as data from a post approval phase III study, SWOG S0106, showed no clinical benefit and rate of fatalities due to treatment-related toxicity was significantly higher.Per the press release, CD33 antigen occurs in nearly 90% of AML patients. In fact, AML occurs in nearly 80% of acute leukemia patients. Moreover, Mylotarg is the first approved therapy for pediatric AML, which will give Mylotarg first-mover advantage. An estimated 21,380 patients in the United States are expected to be diagnosed with AML in 2017 including 500 children, as per the data published in the press release.Chemotherapy is the current preferred therapy for treating AML. With Mylotarg’s approval a new therapy with improved benefits will be available to patients. However, several other companies are also developing therapies for treating AML. These include Seattle Genetics, Inc.’s (SGEN  -  Free Report) SGN-CD33A and Intrexon Corporation’s (XON  -  Free Report) CD33-specific CAR+ T therapy. In August 2017, the FDA approved Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Idhifa as an oral treatment for relapsed or refractory AML patients.Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus  Pfizer, Inc.

3160,CELG,"Biotech giant Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) $11.8 billion deal to buy CAR-T cancer therapy designer, Kite Pharma, Inc.  has made two other leading independent CAR-T developers, Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  and Bluebird Bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) hot takeover targets.Terms of the Gilead/Kite Pharma DealPer the agreement, Gilead will pay $180.00 per share in cash. The total transaction value is approximately $11.9 billion. The price represents a 28% premium over the closing share price of Kite Pharma as of Aug 25, 2017.The transaction was approved by shareholders of both companies and is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2017.While shares of Gilead have shot up 28%, that of Gilead have gone up by almost 3% since the announcement. In-fact, so far this year, Kite Pharma’s stock is up 296.8%which compares favorably with a 9.7% increase registered by the industry.Why Kite Pharma?                                 Kite Pharma’s CAR-T therapy axicabtagene ciloleucel for treating aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is under priority review in the U.S. A decision from the FDA is expected on Nov 29. We believe the solid efficacy profile demonstrated by the pivotal ZUMA-1 study of axicabtagene ciloleucel is likely to support the drug’s approval this year. In Europe, a regulatory application was filed in July 2017 with an approval and launch expected next year.According to the company, the initial market opportunity for axicabtagene ciloleucel includes about 7,400 and 7,000 addressable CAR-T patients in the U.S. and Europe, respectively, while 7,800 new cases are diagnosed in Japan every year and 25,000 in key urban/eastern rural coastal areas of China.Meanwhile, other studies with axicabtagene ciloleucel and additional candidates including KITE-585 and KITE-718 are also advancing.The acquisition should diversify Gilead’s portfolio beyond the struggling HCV franchise and position it to take share in the growing cellular therapy space. The HCV franchise is under pressure because of competition and pricing issues.Other CAR-T Therapy Makers in FocusCAR-T is manufactured for each individual patient using their own cells, thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment process, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create T cells that are genetically coded to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other Bcells expressing a specific antigen.While the deal might look expensive given the premium Gilead paid for Kite, the CAR-T space is expected to be revolutionary in treatments for cancer.  It represents immense potential at this juncture, thereby attracting the attention of big pharmas.It goes without saying that following Kite Pharma’s acquisition by Gilead, other small biotechs developing CAR-T therapies like Juno and Bluebird may be bought by a larger biotech, probably by Gilead or even their biggest partner Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report).Juno is developing JCAR017 in partnership with Celgene for NHL, utilizing the CAR-T cell technology. Data presented in June demonstrated a 50% complete response in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive cd19+ NHL. The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL as early as 2018 and for multiple indications by the end of 2019. In fact, shares of Juno are up almost 43% after the Kite/Gilead deal was announced on buyout speculation. The company’s shares are up 132.4% year to date.Bluebird is developing anti-BCMA CAR T-cell therapy, bb2121, also in collaboration with Celgene. The candidate is only in phase I studies. However, data from an early-stage refractory multiple myeloma study on bb2121 presented in June showed that 100% of the 15 evaluable patients in active dose cohorts achieved an objective response. Overall response rate (ORR) across all cohorts (n=18) was 89%. The investment community believes that the data, though early stage, bode well for the candidate’s future development. Shares of the company are up 66% this year so far.Meanwhile, other small biotechs like Tesaro Inc. (TSRO  -  Free Report), Clovis Oncology Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) and Puma Biotechnology, Inc. (PBYI  -  Free Report), which have launched innovative cancer treatments recently, are also potential acquisition targets now.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

3161,CELG,"Shares of Prothena Corporation plc (PRTA  -  Free Report) moved up 22.6% in the after-market trading session following the news of a global collaboration with biotech bigwig Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report).Both companies have collaborated to develop new therapies for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.  However, Prothena’s stock has declined 47.9% in the last six months, worse than the industry’s  fall of 11.2%.Terms of the AgreementThe multi-year agreement is focused on three proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed target.Tau is a protein, implicated in Alzheimer`s disease (“AD”), progressive supranuclear palsy (“PSP”), frontotemporal dementia (“FTD”), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (“CTE”) and other tauopathies. Prothena has identified antibodies targeting novel epitopes on the tau with the ability to block misfolded tau from binding to cells and to inhibit cell-to-cell transmission, preventing downstream functional toxic effects.On the other hand, TDP-43 is a protein implicated in amytrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and the most common subtype of FTD, behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), a proportion of AD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies. Prothena has generated antibodies that target multiple epitopes on the TDP-43.Celgene will own the rights to license clinical candidates in the United States at the investigational new drug filing stage and if exercised, would also have a right to expand the license to global rights at the completion of phase I.  Consequently, Celgene will be responsible for funding all further global clinical development and commercialization.In exchange, Prothena will receive a $100-million upfront payment. Celgene will also make a $50 million equity investment in Prothena by subscribing to approximately 1.2 million of ordinary shares at $42.57 per share.  Prothena is also eligible for any regulatory and commercial milestones for each licensed program. Prothena will also receive additional royalties on net sales of any resulting marketed products.Our TakeProthena suffered a setback in 2017 when it decided not advance pipeline candidate PRX003 into mid-stage development due to disappointing data in psoriasis patients.Hence, the company is looking to revive its pipeline given the limited number of candidates.  Prothena`s pipeline of antibody therapeutic candidates targets a number of indications including AL amyloidosis (NEOD001), Parkinson`s disease and other related synucleinopathies (PRX002/RG7935) and ATTR amyloidosis (PRX004). Prothena already has a license agreement with Swiss pharma giant Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for the development and commercialization of selected antibodies targeting alpha-synuclein including PRX002.  Tie-ups with well-known companies in the industry like Roche and Celgene make sense for Prothena as the company is highly dependent on collaboration partners for the development of candidates. The company itself does not have enough resources to independently conduct studies on candidates.Celgene, on the other hand, is having its share of troubles too when a label expansion study on lead drug Revlimid failed in phase III.  The stock was hit earlier after a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) was discontinued. The FDA recently issued Refusal to File letter to Celgene’s New Drug Application (NDA) for ozanimod, which is in development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The FDA determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were insufficient to permit a complete review. Hence, Celgene is in desperate need to revive its pipeline through collaborations and acquisitions.  The company recently acquired Juno Therapeutics to focus on the promising CAR-T space.Zacks Rank & Key PickProthena currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here..Regeneron’s earnings per share estimates have moved up to $18.68 from $18.65 in the last 30 days. The company pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 9.15%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

3162,CELG,"The Multiple Sclerosis (MS) space hit the headlines once again following biotech bigwig, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and partner AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) decision to withdraw their jointly owned MS drug, Zinbryta voluntarily on a worldwide basis due to risk of liver injury. Both companies decided to withdraw the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta, given the limited number of patients treated.In November 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) concluded its review of Zinbryta. The review found that unpredictable and potentially fatal immune-mediated liver injury can occur during treatment with Zinbryta and for up to 6 months after stopping treatment. In clinical trials, 1.7% of patients receiving Zinbryta had a serious liver reaction.Given the complexity of the market, MS drugs have a long history of serious side effects, making it a risky therapeutic area.  An autoimmune inflammatory disease of the centrol nervous system, MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. There are three types of MS widely known to affect adults — relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS).The market for MS changed drastically with the introduction of oral formulations which are mostly preferred than injections. While there a variety of drugs available for MS, they come with their own set of risks mostly.Biogen is a dominant player in the MS market with drugs like Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera, Plegridy and Zinbryta.  However, the company has been under the scrutiny for pricing of MS drugs in 2017. Earlier, the emergence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) cases, a type of brain infection, associated with the use of Tysabri and Tecfidera had marred the prospects of MS drugs. The FDA thereafter updated the label of Tecfidera. Nevertheless, the company is a name to reckon with in the MS market.Earlier, the FDA also issued a warning against Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Gilenya for PML. The drug was recently granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Gilenya for the treatment of children and adolescents 10 years of age or older with relapsing MS. The drug is already approved for the same among adults. Novartis has another MS drug in its portfolio, Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg.  Sandoz, the company’s generic arm, recently won FDA approval for a generic version of Copaxone 40mg.Israel-based Teva Pharmceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) has long been in the MS market through its widely used drug Copaxone which is facing stiff competition for the last few years.Meanwhile, in the past, seizures were known side-effects of another MS drug, Ampyra. Seizure risk was seen to increase with higher blood levels of the drug.  As a result, the FDA had to update Ampyra’s label to clarify recommendations that kidney function should be checked in patients before starting Ampyra and monitored at least annually while Ampyra treatment continues.Nevertheless, the risks associated with the drugs have not deterred newer entrants which claim better formulations with lesser side effects. Consequently, the market has become too crowded.In March 2017, the FDA approved Roche’s (RHHBY) Ocrevus to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. However, there were questions if Ocrevus was a new innovation or a reformulation of Roche’s older drug Rituxan. The drug sales aren’t that impressive yet either.The FDA recently issued Refusal to File letter to Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) New Drug Application (NDA) for ozanimod, which is in development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The FDA determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were insufficient to permit a complete review. Hence, the company is now gearing up to meet the FDA and determine the future course of action. While there haven’t been any safety issues reports, the delay will definitely open up avenues for competition.Given that so much is happening in this space, we expect investors to remain glued for further updates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3163,CELG,"The Q4 earnings season for the pharma/biotech sector was scattered with a few small biotech companies yet to report. The releases so far provide us with a clear picture of the sector’s performance.Overall, the sector performed reasonably well. Among the biotech/pharma bigwigs, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) beat earnings and revenue estimates. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced mixed results with earnings beating estimates and sales lagging the same. However, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) had a rather weak quarter as it missed expectations for earnings and sales and also issued a lower-than-expected sales guidance for 2018.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017. Ramp up in new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, favorable clinical study results, frequent FDA approvals, strong performance by key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep driving the sector. A faster drug approval process, the proposed removal of outdated regulations that push up costs and a slowdown in innovation should also prove beneficial.The year started off on expectations of a pick-up in M&A activity. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is expected to spur merger activity this year.Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), earlier this year, announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company, Ablynx, and haemophilia-focused biotech firm — Bioverativ.Banking on the positive trend and impressive Q4 performance, it might be the perfect time to cash in on the bountiful prospects in this growing market. Here we have picked three biotech stocks which saw positive estimate revisions post Q4 earnings release and also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings estimate revisions have the greatest impact on stock prices. Stocks with rising estimates have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index year after year. Hence, investors can safely bet on stocks that have been seeing an upward movement in earnings estimates. All the three companies have also seen a steady rally in the share price post Q4 results.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report)The San Diego, CA-based biotechnology company, Ligand, carries a Zacks Rank #2. The stock witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 30 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 21. It has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings rise 9.8% for 2018 and 21.1% for 2019. The company surpassed earnings and revenue estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 mainly on higher royalty revenues. Additionally, shares of the company have rallied 16.8% post its Q4 earnings release.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report)The Tarrytown, NY-based biopharmaceutical company, Regeneron, witnessed positive estimate revision over the last 60 days. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 8. The Zacks Rank #1 stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings rise 9.7% and 6.4% for 2018 and 2019, respectively. Regeneron’s fourth-quarter results were impressive as both earnings and sales beat estimates on strong sales of the company’s key marketed drug, Eylea. Shares of the company have rallied 7.1% after it released Q4 earnings release.Horizon Pharma plc (HZNP  -  Free Report)Based in Dublin, Ireland, Horizon Pharma carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings move 10% up in the last 30 days for 2018 and 14.9% for 2019. The company released fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 26. Shares of the company have gained 5% post Q4 earnings announcement. Horizon Pharma also beat earnings and sales estimates in fourth-quarter 2017 backed by strong performance by its Orphan unit. The company’s sales guidance for 2018 is encouraging as well.OutlookWhile 2017 was strong, this year is expected to be a vital one for the biotech sector as these companies continue to invest in pipeline, build global business and drive new product growth.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

3164,CELG,"Shares of Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) have been down 21% in the year so far compared to a 3.3% decline for the overall biotech industry.  Setbacks in Recent TimesCelgene has been sailing in troubled waters for quite some time now. Notably, things have been on the downturn for the company since last October, after Celgene announced a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease, and the discontinuation of the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004), following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis.In December 2017, a late-stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan failed. Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. While Revlimid sales continue to be impressive, we are concerned about the company’s dependence on the product for growth. The drug is set to lose patent exclusivity soon and hence Celgene is desperately trying to revive its portfolio.The company suffered a setback in early 2018, when it received Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for multiple sclerosis candidate, ozanimod. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (“MS”). The FDA stated that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were inadequate to allow a complete review. Hence, Celgene will request a Type A meeting with the FDA to ascertain the additional information needed for resubmission of the NDA. The news comes as a great disappointment for investors, given the potential the MS market holds.Thereafter, the company’s president and chief operating officer, Scott A. Smith, resigned from his position.Pipeline Looks PromisingNevertheless, things are looking up for this troubled biotech company. Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics and added JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to its lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T candidate, currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The candidate is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the United States in 2019 with potential global peak sales of approximately $3 billion. Another candidate for multiple myeloma is JCARH125.The company also announced a development and co-promotion agreement with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report). Both companies have entered into a deal to co-develop and co-promote bb2121, an experimental anti-B-cell maturation antigen chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in the United States.Celgene is poised to launch two CAR-T therapies for blood cancers in the next three years with bluebird’s bb2121 for myeloma and JCAR017 for relapsed lymphoma.Most recently, Celgene and partner Acceleron Pharma Inc. (XLRN  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a phase III, multi-center study, MEDALIST. The MEDALIST study evaluated the efficacy and safety of luspatercept versus placebo in patients with very low, low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with chronic anemia, and refractory to, intolerant of, or ineligible for treatment with an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (ESA), ring sideroblast-positive and require frequent red blood cells (RBC)  transfusions.The study showed that luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of RBC transfusion independence of at least eight consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks compared to placebo. Luspatercept also met the key secondary endpoint of demonstrating a highly statistically significant improvement in RBC transfusion independence of at least 12 consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks. The study also achieved modified hematologic improvement-erythroid (IWG mHI-E), a meaningful secondary endpoint. Based on these results, the company expects to file for submissions, and regulatory submissions are planned in the United States and Europe in the first half of 2019.Hence, while the first half of 2018 was dismal for the company, we do expect a better performance in the second half and thereafter.Zacks RankCelgene carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

Both companies decided to withdraw the drug on grounds of the complex and evolving benefit/risk profile of Zinbryta, given the limited number of patients being treated.  The drug is currently available in Europe and United States, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. While AbbVie distributes Zinbryta in the United States, Biogen distributes the drug in ex-U.S. markets.  The European regulatory authorities provisionally restricted the use of Zinbryta in adult patients with highly active relapsing disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one DMT or with rapidly evolving severe relapsing MS who are unsuitable for treatment with other DMTs following the report of a case of fatal fulminant liver failure, as well as four cases of serious liver injury.Gilead Reports New Data on Biktarvy: Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results at 48 weeks from a phase III study (Study 1961) among 470 virologically suppressed adult women with HIV infection at the International Workshop on HIV and Women and at the 2018 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (“CROI”) in Boston (Poster 2539).

3168,CELG,"It has been more than a month since the last earnings report for Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Celgene Beats Earnings But Misses on SalesCelgene reported mixed results in third-quarter 2017 wherein earnings beat expectations but sales failed to meet estimates.The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.91 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.88, up from $1.58 in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues grew 10.2% to $3.29 billion in the quarter but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.42 billion. Revenues were boosted by consistent performance of the company’s key growth driver, Revlimid. However, sales of Otezla in the United States were weak.Revlimid Continues to ShineNet product sales increased 10.6% year over year to $3.28 billion. Net sales of Revlimid came in at $2.0 billion, reflecting 10% year-over-year growth. The drug performed well in the United States (up 17.9%). Growth in the reported quarter was driven by increased volume as a result of increases in duration of treatment and market share.Net sales of another cancer drug, Abraxane increased 7.7% to $251 million as sales grew both in the United States and international markets. Sales of oncology drug, Pomalyst/Imnovid, came in at $417 million, up 22.3%. Sales were driven by increased volume from duration gains.Otezla reported sales of $308 million in the reported quarter, up 12%. Sales in the United States were impacted by an increase in gross-to-net adjustments from contracts implemented in January and a slowing in overall category growth due to a more challenging market access environment.All other product sales (including Istodax, Thalomid, Vidaza and an authorized generic version of Vidaza in the United States) totaled $226 million in the reported quarter, down from $228 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted research and development expenses increased 8.6% to $698 million due to increased spending related to drug discovery and clinical trial activity while adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 11.8% to $521 million.Last month, Celgene announced that the FDA put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program. Partial clinical hold has been put on five trials and a full clinical hold on one trial. The trials were evaluating Imfinzi, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in combination with immunomodulatory and chemotherapy agents in blood cancers such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma. Celgene entered into a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC's MedImmune in April 2015 to develop and commercialize Imfinzi for hematologic malignancies in combination with Revlimid, Pomalyst, Vidaza and others. The FDA placed a hold on these trials due to risks identified in other trials for an anti-PD-1 antibody, Keytruda, in patients with multiple myeloma in combination with immunomodulatory agents.2017 Outlook UpdatedCelgene updated its guidance for 2017. The company anticipates earnings in the range of $7.30-$7.35 compared with the previous guidance of $7.25-$7.35 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $7.34 per share.Revenues are now projected at $13 billion compared to the earlier projection of $13-13.4 billion.Revlimid sales are projected between $8 billion and $8.3 billion. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.6 billion. However, Otezla sales are now projected at $1.25 billion, down from the previous projection of $1.5-$1.7 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downward momentum. There has been one move higher compared to six lower two months ago.Celgene Corporation Price and Consensus  Celgene Corporation Price and Consensus | Celgene Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Celgene's stock has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than growth investors.OutlookWhile estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, the magnitude of this revision has been net zero. Interestingly, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

3169,CELG,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced the submission of regulatory applications to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (""EMA"") seeking label expansion of its multiple myeloma (“MM”) drug Darzalex in the first-line setting.A potential approval will allow Darzalex to be used in combination with J&J’s proteasome inhibitor MM drug Velcade (bortezomib), melphalan and prednisone to treat MM in treatment-naïve patients who cannot have autologous stem cell transplantation in bone marrow. If approved, this will be the fifth indication for the drug.We are encouraged by J&J’s efforts to expand Darzalex’s label further, a drug which generated one-sixth of the company’s total oncology sales in the first nine months of 2017. We note that Darzalex was first approved in November 2015 as monotherapy for MM in patients treated with at least three prior lines of therapy, followed by approvals in the past two years as combination therapy in second and third-line settings.J&J’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The company’s shares have gained 20.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.8%.J&J has submitted top-line data from the phase III ALCYONE study to support its regulatory applications in both the geographies. Data from the study showed that the Darzalex combination therapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50% when compared to treatment with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (standard of care) alone.J&J will present the data at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology scheduled to be held between Dec 9 and Dec 12.We note that J&J licensed Darzalex from Genmab through its subsidiary, Janssen, in 2012. J&J holds the worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the drug and has to pay milestone payments to Genmab.Per the National Cancer Institute, 30,280 new patients are likely to be diagnosed with MM and it will cause 12,590 deaths in the United States in 2017 alone.Darzalex competes with other approved and marketed treatments for MM, which include Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid, Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Kyprolis and Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Emplicti.Johnson & Johnson Price  Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3170,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) and partner bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) announced that their chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy candidate, bb2121 targeting b-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in previously treated patients with multiple myeloma obtained Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA.The candidate was also granted PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) eligibility by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions while PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need.We remind investors that Celgene entered into a collaboration agreement with bluebird bio in March 2013 to develop CAR-T cell therapies. The collaboration was amended and restated to focus on developing product candidates targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in June 2015. The lead candidate in this program is bb2121, anti-BCMA CAR-T program is currently being studied in a phase I trial for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Both companies are also developing a second anti-BCMA CAR-T program, bb21217.CAR-T uses patient’s cells to identify and destroy cancer cells, thereby making it different from other small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen.The therapy has been in spotlight in 2017. Novartis AG's (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah was the first CAR-T to get FDA approval in September 2017. Last month, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) also received FDA’s approval for Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.While the long-term impact of the treatment is yet to be evaluated, the approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer.  Meanwhile, Celgene’s stock has fallen 12% in the last six months as against the industry’s gain of 0.5%.Celgene’s third-quarter results were mixed with the company beating earnings but missing sales estimates. While Revlimid sales were impressive yet again, Otezla sales in the United States were weak which led the management to reduce annual guidance for the drug.Zacks RankCelgene is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3171,CELG,"The biotech industry turned around this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.It had a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.However, after rising 15.4% in the first nine months of the year (January-September), the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has declined 13.4% so far in the fourth quarter (Oct 1 - to date). Both macro and industry specific factors resulted in the sudden downfall.Uncertain Macro PictureA big component of this sell-off is the confusion over the passing of the tax reform. The reform aims to bring down corporate tax to stimulate economic as well as employment growth.The proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last. It goes without saying that significant uncertainty regarding the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform has cast a shadow over the future of the biotech sector.In October, President Trump once again criticized high drug prices. This came at a time when investors had started to expect that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, sending health-care stocks lower.Tepid Q3 ResultsComing to some industry specific factors, most big biotechs beat estimates for earnings and sales in Q3. However, shares of most of these companies declined post earnings release for various reasons.Although Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) topped both earnings and revenue estimates in the third quarter, it witnessed continued decline in sales of its HCV drugs — Harvoni and Sovaldi — as a result of competitive and pricing pressure.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and sales in Q3 and raised its earnings guidance for 2017. However sales declined year over year, which resulted in share price decline post the earnings call. Sales of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, were also disappointing.Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares plunged following the release of third-quarter results. Although Celgene’s earnings topped estimates, revenues fell short. Moreover, the company lowered its 2017 outlook for Otezla sales as well as its total revenue and earnings outlook for 2020.Although Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third-quarter results were better than expected, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza.Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates but missed on revenues in the third quarter.Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) were the only two outperformers in Q3.ConclusionWe believe that the biotech space should be back on track if there is more certainty regarding the timing of the tax reforms. This is because the fundamentals of the sector remain strong. Meanwhile, with the Q3 earnings season now behind us, stocks should start picking up. Positive data from key clinical studies can drive the sector up as share price of biotechs is correlated to success in key studies. The major biotech players need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets from outside. Strategic deals signed by these biotechs can also push the stocks higher.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3172,CELG,"Per reports, biotech bigwig Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is looking to acquire smaller biotech Juno Therapeutics .Rationale of the DealCelgene is on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017.  Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed.Earlier in Jan 2018, Celgene announced it will acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Fedratinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary endpoints of splenic response and total symptom score, respectively in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III pivotal trial (JAKARTA-1) for treatment-naïve MF.We note that the slowdown in mature products compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and subsequently obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate.Why is Celgene Mulling Over the Acquisition?Celgene already has a collaboration and investment agreement with Juno for the development and commercialization of immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases. The agreement became effective in July 2015. Per the terms of the agreement, Celgene has the option to be the commercialization partner for Juno’s oncology and cell therapy auto-immune product candidates, including Juno’s CD19 and CD22 directed CAR T-cell product candidates.Per the deal, Juno will have the option to enter into co-development and co-commercialization arrangements on certain Celgene-originated development candidates that target T-cells.In April 2016, Celgene exercised option to develop and commercialize Juno’s CD19 program outside North America and China. The company also entered into a pre-negotiated license agreement with Juno with respect to such program by making a $50.0-million license payment.  Celgene’s stock has loss 22.3% of its value in the last six months compared with the industry’s decline of 2.4% while Juno’s stock surged significantly following the news.CAR-T Therapy Holds PromiseThe CAR-T therapy space was in the spotlight in 2017 as the FDA approved the first CAR-T therapy, Kymriah for the treatment of patients upto 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse stage.Given the immense potential of the therapy, Celgene too wants to go the Gilead way. Meanwhile, Celgene also has a partnership with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) for CAR-T therapy candidates.  Last month, the company also announced results from the ongoing CRB-401 phase I clinical study on investigational anti-B-cell maturation antigen CAR-T cell therapy, bb2121. The data showed ORR of 94% in patients in active dose cohorts (doses above 50 x 106 CAR + T-cells) and CR rate of 56% observed in patients in active dose cohorts.Zacks RankCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3175,CELG,"Quite a few pharmaceutical industry mergers – including some large deals - may be in the cards in 2018 now that the tax reforms are in place. The tax bill was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in December last yearThe tax rate for corporates will now go down from 35% to 21%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%. Also the tax cuts are expected to prevent inversions, which were rampant in the drug industry.These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017 compared to 2016.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion were the only two noteworthy deals of 2017.This week, senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical/biotech companies discussed the impact of tax reform on mergers and acquisition and their plans to use the excess cash at the JP Morgan HealthCare conference.What the CEOs Said?Brent Saunders, chief executive officer (CEO) of Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) said that the first half of the year is likely to see smaller deals such as the one by Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) while the bigger high profile mergers of large pharmaceuticals/biotech companies would probably happen in the latter half of the year or next year.Last week, Celgene announced that it has offered to buy a small cancer drug developer, Impact Biomedicines. (Read More: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) CEO Dave Ricks and J&J’s Chief Financial Officer, Dominic Caruso said that with the tax cuts, American companies can compete better with their foreign counterparts, which operate in better tax environments. Caruso said the new tax law provides “more flexibility and ease of analysis in terms of getting a transaction done”.Along the same lines, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO, Meg Tirrell, said that having access to overseas cash will give it more financial flexibility to “think about different ways to go about the M&A transactions”. Tirrell, however, confidently said that even before the new tax law was implemented, the company had “enough power in their balance sheet” to make the bolt-on acquisitions it wanted to do.Michel Vounatsos, Biogen's (BIIB  -  Free Report) CEO, smartly argued that though the tax overhaul may spur some M&A activity, the rationale behind any M&A activity should not be the cash available. He went on to say that they are looking at “all sets of potential targets”.Gilead CEO, John Milligan, said that the tax reform is good for the company as it “allows to plan for the long term” since the FDA approval process is quite lengthy. Meanwhile, it maintained its goal of investing in M&A to replenish the pipeline. He also said that the excess cash will allow it to clean up its balance sheet by repaying debt.Conclusion Overall, it is quite clear that the drug industry is optimistic that the tax reform will fuel greater M&A activity in 2018.As it is, major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buyouts. Strategic M&A and licensing deals are therefore inevitable for innovation starved drug/biotech companies looking for growth in a highly competitive and global marketplace.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. What matters for companies looking to buy a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of the latter’s drugs/products, prospects of sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

3176,CELG,"This week, the focus is on the 36th annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference where several biotech and pharma companies provided a preliminary look at their results for 2017 and have also provided pipeline updates as well as their outlooks for 2018. Meanwhile, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) was in the news with the company announcing its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCelgene to Buy Impact: Celgene has started the year with an acquisition announcement – the company will be acquiring Impact Biomedicines, which is developing fedratinib for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. The deal terms include an upfront payment of approximately $1.1 billion and contingent payments of up to $1.25 billion based on the achievement of regulatory approval milestones for myelofibrosis. Celgene could make additional payments based on approvals for label expansion and the achievement of sales-based milestones. Plans are on to submit a new drug application to the FDA in mid-2018. Celgene is looking to boost its pipeline with this acquisition. The company had a rough 2017 with shares declining 12.1% over the last one year. Issues like pipeline setbacks as well as the weak performance of Otezla have been weighing on the stock (Read more: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Key Takeaways from J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference: Several biotech companies were present at the 36th annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference. Most of these companies provided a preliminary look at fourth quarter results and their outlook for 2018. Among key updates, Acorda (ACOR  -  Free Report) could start facing generic competition for its flagship drug, Ampyra, any time after Jul 30, 2018. The company is currently seeking FDA approval for Inbrija for which a response could be out in February (Read more: Acorda's Shares Down on Disappointing Ampyra View for 2018). Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report), which holds a strong position in the cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market, is looking to strengthen its position further with the potential approval of tezacaftor/ivacaftor in the United States – a decision from the FDA is expected on Feb 28, 2018. Vertex could also be one of the companies that will pursue acquisition deals this year. Celgene also provided its preliminary results and 2018 outlook (Read more: Celgene Provides 2017 Preliminary Results & 2018 View). Vertex is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Axovant Plunges on Intepirdine Discontinuation: Axovant Sciences’s (AXON  -  Free Report) shares lost more than 50% of their value with the company announcing disappointing results on its lead pipeline candidate intepirdine. The candidate failed to meet the primary efficacy endpoints in studies that were conducted in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (“DLB”) and patients with dementia and gait impairment. Based on this, Axovant has decided to discontinue the development of intepirdine.This is not the first time that Axovant has faced a setback in its development efforts for intepirdine. Last year in September, the company had said that intepirdine failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study being conducted in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (""AD"") patients who were receiving background donepezil therapy. At that time too, the company’s shares had plunged significantly (73.9%). Axovant’s shares are down 81.7% over the last one year compared to the 3.3% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Regeneron & Sanofi Boost R&D Investment in Dupixent and Cemiplimab: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi have decided to boost their investment in the development of cemiplimab (a PD-1 antibody) in oncology and Dupixent (an IL-4/IL-13 pathway-blocking antibody) in type 2 allergic diseases. Based on this decision, investment in cemiplimab will shoot up to at least $1.64 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion from the initial agreement, with both companies contributing equally. Cemiplimab is being studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with other therapies in a wide range of cancers including advanced skin cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphomas. Regulatory applications for cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are scheduled to be submitted in the European Union and the United States in the first quarter of 2018.  Meanwhile, Dupixent, currently approved for eczema, has the potential to be evaluated for additional indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peanut allergy and grass allergy and in patients who have multiple allergic conditions. This is in addition to ongoing development in pediatric atopic dermatitis, pediatric asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyposis. Regeneron and Sanofi are currently seeking FDA approval for Dupixent in uncontrolled, persistent asthma in patients at least 12 years old.Another candidate that should benefit from the additional investment is REGN3500, an IL-33 antibody, with potential indications including atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.AbbVie Eczema Drug Gets BTD: AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) investigational, once-daily oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) by the FDA for use in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s). Upadacitinib is scheduled to move into a late-stage program for atopic dermatitis in the first half of the year (Read more: AbbVie's Upadacitinib Gains Breakthrough Therapy Designation).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 0.3% over the last four trading sessions.

3177,CELG,"Corcept Therapeutics Inc.’s (CORT  -  Free Report) adjusted third-quarter 2017 earnings (including stock-based compensation expenses) of 11 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents. However, the reported figure improved from the year-ago adjusted earnings of 2 cents.Revenues increased 96.8% from the year-ago quarter figure to $42.8 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41 million.So far this year, Corcept’s share price has increased 149.9% year to date, as against the industry’s decline of 0.1%. Research and development expenses improved 65% to $11.7 million. Likewise, selling, general and administrative expenses were up 50.7% to $16.5 million. In fact, the increase in operating expenses was primarily owing to greater compensation expense, pharmacy costs related to higher revenue and increased spending on the development of relacorilant (the newly-approved generic name for CORT125134), CORT118335 and CORT125281.Pipeline UpdateCorcept expects results from phase II study of relacorilant by end of first quarter 2018.

3178,CELG,"Major biotech stocks like Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report), Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Alexion, AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results over the last few days. Companies like Gilead and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) also provided regulatory updates. Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Gilead’s results were strong with the company’s HIV franchise putting in a strong performance and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise performing better than expected. The company raised its revenue outlook including for the HCV franchise (Read more: Gilead Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenue Estimates, Stock Up). Celgene also topped estimates and raised its earnings guidance for the year (Read more: Celgene Beats Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates, Ups View) as did Alexion (Read more: Alexion Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Ups 2017 View). Vertex (Read more: Vertex Q2 Earnings Top on Solid Cystic Fibrosis Sales) and AbbVie too topped expectations (Read more: AbbVie Tops Q2 Earnings & Revenues, Outlook Intact).Earlier-Than-Expected FDA Approval for Celgene/Agios Cancer Drug: Celgene and partner, Agios (AGIO  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for Idhifa (enasidenib) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) with IDH2 mutation as detected by an FDA approved test. The approval came ahead of the FDA action date of Aug 30, 2017.This makes Idhifa the first and only FDA-approved therapy for this patient population, which represents 8 – 19% of AML patients, as per information provided by the companies. More than 21,000 new cases of AML are detected every year in the U.S. with the majority of patients seeing their disease relapse eventually. The prognosis for R/R AML is poor with overall survival for this patient population estimated to be less than six months. Although Idhifa comes with a boxed warning regarding differentiation syndrome, uptake should be strong given the significant unmet medical need.Will it be Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B? Dynavax’s (DVAX  -  Free Report) shares shot up on a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. With the positive vote, expectations are high that the company will finally gain approval for the vaccine which had previously received two complete response letters (one in Nov 2016 and the other in Feb 2013). A decision from the agency is expected on Aug 10. If approved, Dynavax plans to launch the vaccine early next year. Dynavax’s shares are up a whopping 284.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 9.8% rally (Read more: Dynavax Shares Jump 75% after FDA Committee Approval).Vertex Ups CF Outlook on Kalydeco Label Expansion: Vertex’s cystic fibrosis (CF) drug Kalydeco’s label has been expanded in the U.S. and can now be used in the more than 600 CF patients (2 years and older) who have one of five residual function mutations that result in a splicing defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. With this label expansion, Vertex upped its 2017 sales guidance for the drug to $770 million - $800 million (old guidance: $740 - $770 million). Vertex now expects total CF product revenues of $1.87 billion - $2.1 billion (old guidance: $1.84 - $2.07 billion), including Orkambi sales of $1.1 billion - $1.3 billion (unchanged).Regulatory Updates from Amgen and Gilead: Amgen provided quite a few regulatory updates over the last few days. The company said that it has submitted a regulatory application in the U.S. seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Prolia brought in sales of $930 million in the first half of 2017.Amgen along with partner Allergan also said that they have filed for FDA approval of ABP 980, a biosimilar candidate to Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab). Herceptin is approved for the treatment of HER2+ adjuvant breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer in the U.S.Meanwhile, Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha, got priority review in the U.S. for the inclusion of FOURIER cardiovascular outcomes study data on the reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. A decision from the agency is expected on Dec 2, 2017. Amgen said that a second application for the expansion of the lipid-lowering indication to include additional patient populations studied was also accepted by the agency.Gilead also had some updates on the regulatory front. The company said that its HCV drug, Epclusa’s label was updated in the U.S. to include use in patients co-infected with HIV. Epclusa, which initially gained approval in Jun 2016, is an all-oral, pan-genotypic, once-daily single tablet regimen. The label expansion provides co-infected patients with a convenient one-pill-a-day regimen that works across all HCV genotypes and is compatible with widely-used antiretroviral regimens. Epclusa sales crossed $2 billion in the first half of 2017.Moreover, Gilead’s latest HCV offering Vosevi gained approval in the EU for the treatment of all genotypes. The marketing authorization for Harvoni in the EU was also extended allowing use in the adolescent population. Vosevi was approved in the U.S. a few weeks back in July.Gilead is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 2.5% over the last five trading sessions.

3179,CELG,"The FDA, which approved 22 treatments last year, has given its approval to 26 drugs so far in 2017 including 3 in July. Key approvals this year include Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of August.Another New Indication for Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo?Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is looking to get the label of its PD-1 inhibitor expanded for use in patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) after prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. The regulatory application is currently under priority review with a response expected on Aug 2, 2017. Opidivo is currently approved for a wide range of indications and brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Bristol-Myers has lost 2.6% of its value year to date (YTD) versus the 10.5% growth of its industry.Will J&J RA Drug Win Support of FDA Panel?The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting tomorrow to discuss the BLA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. While new treatment options have entered the market over the last couple of decades, RA patients are still not adequately managed with many left with fewer therapeutic options due to loss of response to available agents, and poor compliance due to inconvenient dosing.Earlier this week, the FDA had released briefing documents for the meeting which indicate a lot of emphasis will be placed on the safety profile of the drug especially the imbalance in all cause death between Plivensia and placebo. If approved, Plivensia would enter a pretty crowded market given the presence of drugs like Humira, Actemra and Kevzara among others, though its once-monthly dosing schedule could give it an advantage. Shares of J&J have gained 15.2% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Will FDA Follow in EU’s Path and Give the Green Signal to AbbVie’s Maviret?AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) also has an important regulatory event coming up with the FDA expected to respond on the approval status of the company’s latest hepatitis C virus (HCV) offering this month. Maviret, an investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), is a once-daily ribavirin-free treatment that has the potential to provide a faster path to virologic cure for all major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). Maviret represents blockbuster potential and could help AbbVie gain major market share once approved and launched. We note that Maviret gained EU approval just last week. Shares of AbbVie have gained 11.6% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B?It’s been a great week for clinical-stage immunology company Dynavax Technologies Corp. (DVAX  -  Free Report) which got a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. With the positive vote, will it be third time lucky for the company which has previously received two complete response letters for Heplisav-B (one in Nov 2016 and the other in Feb 2013) from the FDA? A decision from the agency is expected on Aug 10. If approved, Dynavax plans to launch the vaccine early next year. Dynavax’s shares shot up 71.4% on the positive panel vote and are up a whopping 301.3% YTD, significantly outperforming the industry’s10.5% rally.Pfizer’s Xeljanz to Be Reviewed by FDA Advisory PanelPfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) has two regulatory events this month -- the first is an FDA advisory panel meeting and the other a PDUFA date. The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting on Aug 3 to discuss supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) submitted by the company for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz and Xeljanz XR, for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Efficacy and safety data and benefit-risk considerations will be discussed by the panel. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $927 million in 2016.Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to give a response regarding the approval status of Pfizer’s Besponsa which recently gained approval in the EU. If approved in the U.S., Besponsa will provide a new treatment option for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an aggressive type of blood cancer with poor prognosis in adults. According to information provided by Pfizer, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with relapsed or refractory adult ALL is less than 10%. Pfizer stock has gained 2.1% YTD, lagging the industry it belongs to. Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some other FDA decisions scheduled for this month include a response regarding Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) and partner Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Idhifa (under priority review for relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an IDH2 mutation) on Aug 30. Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to decide on the approval status of Valeant’s eye drug, Vesneo (latanoprostene bunod) and Adamas’ ADS-5102 (treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in people with Parkinson's disease) on Aug 24.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

Sales were driven by increased volume from duration gains.Otezla reported sales of $358 million in the reported quarter, up 49% driven by market share gains in the U.S. and increasing contribution from early launch markets in Europe and Japan.All other product sales (including Istodax, Thalomid, Vidaza and an authorized generic version of Vidaza in the U.S.) totaled $219 million in the reported quarter, down from $236 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted research and development expenses increased 14.8% to $690 million, while adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.7% to $532 million.2017 Outlook UpdatedCelgene updated its guidance for 2017. The company anticipates earnings in the range of $7.25–$7.35 compared with the previous guidance of $7.15–$7.30 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $6.62 per share. Net product sales are still projected at $13 billion–$13.4 billion.Revlimid sales are projected between $8 billion–$8.3 billion. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. While Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.6 billion, the same for Otezla are estimated around $1.5 billion–$1.7 billion.Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteOur TakeCelgene’s second-quarter results were strong with the company beating on both earnings and sales estimates. Revlimid continued to outperform on the back of market share gains in the quarter. Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla – also performed well. The consecutive increase in earnings guidance for 2017 is positive.Meanwhile, the company continues to progress with its label expansion efforts and pipeline development. Revlimid was approved as a single agent for maintenance therapy in adult patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) following autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) both in the U.S. and EU.NDMM market share continues to grow outside the U.S., with a positive uptake both in the EU and in JapanCelgene, in partnership Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AGIO  -  Free Report), submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for Idhifa (enasidenib) in relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The NDA was granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Aug 30, 2017. A potential approval will further boost the topline. Celgene has also collaborated with Acceleron Pharma (XLRN  -  Free Report) to jointly develop sotatercept (phase II – chronic kidney disease) and luspatercept.Zacks Rank & Key PickCelgene is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis, Inc.

3182,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) provided preliminary results for 2017 and guidance for 2018 at the 36th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.The company expects earnings per share (EPS) of around $7.44 in 2017, up 25% year over year. Operating margin is anticipated around 58.1%. For the fourth quarter, EPS is anticipated around $2.00, a 24% increase year over year. Operating margin is expected around 55.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the fourth quarter is $1.92 and $7.34 for 2017.Total revenues are expected around $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $13.0 billion in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fourth quarter is $3.45 billion and $13 billion for 2017. Revlimid revenues are expected around $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $8.2 billion for 2017.Pomalyst revenues are expected around $442 million and $1.6 billion in 2017. Otezla revenues are expected around $371 million in the fourth quarter and $1.3 billion in 2017. Abraxane revenues are around $251 million in the fourth quarter and $992 million in 2017.Guidance for 2018Total revenues are expected to be around $14.4-$14.8 billion while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $14.98 billion. Revlimid net sales are projected around $9.4 billion while Otezla net sales are projected around $1.5 billion.  The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA for Revlimid in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in 2018.  The company also plans to submit a NDA to the FDA for fedratinib in myelofibrosis.Abraxane net sales are projected around $1.0 billion. EPS is projected around $8.70- $8.90.The company has also planned to initiate a few trials — CC-122 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, BGB-A317 (tislelizumab) in non-small cell lung cancer, a phase III trial with bb2121 in third-line plus multiple myeloma in collaboration with bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report), a phase III trial with JCAR017 in transplant-eligible second-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in collaboration with Juno Therapeutics  among others.Long Term TargetIn the long run, revenues are expected around $19.0-$20.0 billion (by 2020). Celgene’s stock has declined 20.1% in the last six months compared with the industry’s loss of 2.9%.Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback last week when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed.The study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared with the standard of care featuring Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-VN CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. In 2016, the drug’s worldwide sales increased 20% to $7.0 billion and contributed almost 62.1% of the total revenues. Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma.The failure of the study is disappointing. The drug’s label expansion would have boosted its sales potential.To boost its oncology portfolio, Celgene announced that it will acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion.Per the terms of agreement, Impact Biomedicines’ shareholders will receive contingent payments based on regulatory approval and sales-based milestones. The maximum aggregate amount payable for such milestone payments is $1.4 billion.  The aggregate tiered sales-based milestone payments could total to a maximum of $4.5 billion if global annual net sales exceed $5.0 billion.The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera. Fedratinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary endpoints of splenic response and total symptom score, respectively in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III pivotal trial (JAKARTA-1) for treatment-naïve MF.In August 2017, the company obtained an FDA approval for Idhifa for treatment of relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The drug was developed in partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AGIO  -  Free Report).Zacks RankCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3183,CELG,"Welcome back to Mind Over Money. I’m Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of Behavioral Economics.This episode is all about the risk-reward mechanics of decision-making. Sometimes we avoid making decisions, and often we never learn from our bad ones. I was fortunate that I became a high-frequency currency trader some 20 years ago and learned how to make lots of decisions every hour that I could never afford to regret, and only learn from.But that doesn’t mean I don't still fall prey to the bad habits we all have when faced with uncertainty and risk.Did you ever wonder how great investors and traders make decisions that put them consistently ahead of their peers?I do not put myself in the category of greatness, but I know a little about those who belong because I’ve spent considerable time in the past two decades studying great short-term traders and great long-term investors.Now in finance, you always have to be careful when talking about success to make sure you are not just high-lighting the survivors. Since there’s always a winner, we have to make certain we are looking at credible degrees of success, over time, that go beyond mere randomness.When I studied short-term traders in the 1990s in the commodity and currency pits of Chicago, and read about them in Jack Schwager’s Market Wizards book, I came away with six pillars of behavior that seemed to make all the difference over time and across markets. They were...1) Psychology: not just awareness of bias and decision-making, but continuous process improvement.2) Probability: without sound mechanics of situational risk and reward, it’s way too easy for emotions and bias to take over.3) Systems: not just a computer that spits out signals, but systems for everything from your research process to performance evaluation.4) Risk Management: precise rules for capital allocation and preservation are crucial to long-term survival.5) Discipline: speaks for itself, especially if making dozens of decisions per day that require consistent rule-following.6) Consistency: can you run all these processes for years and survive the vagaries of changing markets and seasons?What happens when a trader or investor doesn’t try to master these principles and skills? At worst, they lose all their money quickly. At best, they might get lucky and survive, but not for long.And in the middle is the majority that slowly watches their money bleed away a little every week, sometimes in bigger chunks.When I saw how hard it was to apply these principles in the chaos of markets, I looked to two different sciences to help explain it. Behavioral finance, spear-headed by Nobel prize winner Daniel Kahneman,looked at human decision making under uncertainty and risk with experiments to find out what do most people do in a given situation.I say that these researchers study us from the “outside-in” to explain behavior. And the neuroscientists, of course, study us from the “inside-out” to explain our actions.After I read as much of the important research from both sciences as I could handle, I came up with a stunning conclusion: Your Brain Wasn’t Made to Trade.And it fit with what evolutionary biologists and anthropologists were teaching us about what kinds of brains a few million years of “fits and starts” from natural selection gave us. They definitely weren’t made for staring at prices moving rapidly up and down and changing our wealth outlook by the second.How do I know? Because most of us naturally do exactly the wrong things, especially in short-term trading. We hold on to losing trades and we take profits too soon. This, is the mathematical recipe for making your money go away over time.In trading, the Golden Rule is “Cut thy losses short, and let thy winners run.” But most human traders (and monkeys) do exactly the opposite as fear, greed, illogical biases and ego take over, and we make our money go away from us.We assume we can make rational decisions about our money that are best for the long-term, but that is a big assumption. Most of us are very irrational when it comes to every day money/risk decisions and long-term planning ones.I covered much of this in my March 21, 2017 episode “Irrational Demands: Of Anchors, Pearls, and Procrastination.”Well, back in 2004, I was pretty proud of my original idea that Your Brain Wasn’t Made to Trade. Then I remembered a book I had read in 1990 that probably helped me along this path. New World, New Mind by Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich, the former a neuropsychiatrist and the latter a biologist who was famous for some of his alarming calls about over-population back in the 70s and 80s. Their book proposed that...The evolution of our brains, and our ability to sense cataclysmic change that takes place over long periods of time, is simply not going fast enough. The only thing that can make a difference is accelerated cultural evolution.Here’s how one bright observer, who reviewed the book on Amazon, described it...""One of the more compelling points the authors make is that not only are politicians being elected and rewarded on the basis of short-term decisions that are by many measures intellectually, morally, and financially corrupt, but the so-called knowledge workers--the scientists, engineers, and others who should be ""blowing the whistle,"" are so specialized that there is a real lack of integrative knowledge.""Can you think of some areas – besides the obvious climate change debate – where short-term thinking blinds us to long-term effects and changes?I think of education vs. the entertainment machine where parents are far too likely to let their kids have electronic gadgets, TVs, and phones to babysit them because mom and dad have stuff to do, or both parents work.Another is the nuclear arms race which seemed to be a problem that got put on ice in the 1990s and now with North Korea rattling their sabre this month, we feel that old question again “Could it really happen?”This is one of the biggest examples that Ornstein and Ehrlich highlighted in New World, New Mind. I can’t remember exactly how they framed the problem or their solution – other than new cultural and political institutions that move beyond warfare as a primary solution -- but the first thing that comes to mind for me is that if some of us are more irrational than others, why do we sleep tight thinking we can prevent nuclear war when just about any very lucky idiot could get his hands on a missile?That’s scary stuff. And we can’t say for sure we’ve figured out a good solution just because we’ve gone 60-some years without incident. Our stone-age brains can barely comprehend that kind of cataclysm. So it’s easier not to think about. But Ornstein and Ehrlich thought we should try anyway.If you think I have a solution, I don't. But I am an eternal optimist and so in the rest of this episode of the Mind Over Money podcast, I share a book by another dynamic duo who 25 years later care about our fate – and science – just as much as Ehrlich and Ornstein.I also break down this week’s big trading in “immuno-oncology” stocks such as Kite Pharmaceuticals , which was bought by Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) for $12 billion and caused a feverish rally in related peers like Juno Therapeutics  and bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report). I tell you how I’m playing these stocks and whether or not Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) might be the next bidder for a little biotech wonder.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the Healthcare Innovators portfolio.

3184,CELG,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter results on Aug 3.Shares have surged 38.9% so far this year, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 22.3%.Agios’ performance has been mixed with the company missing estimates twice in the trailing four quarters and surpassing the same on the two other occasions. Overall, Agios has an average positive surprise of 0.90%.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteLast quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 12.85%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayAs a development-stage company, Agios does not have approved products in its portfolio yet. Investors are thus expected to keep an eye on pipeline updates at the earnings call.It is worth mentioning that the company has several interesting candidates in its pipeline. Its cancer pipeline comprises Idhifa (enasidenib), AG-120 (IDH1 mutant inhibitor) and AG-881 (pan-IDH mutant inhibitor). Notably, Agios is developing enasidenib and AG-881 in collaboration with Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report), which should bring in collaboration revenues.Idhifa is presently under FDA review for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The company expects the FDA to give its decision on Aug 30, 2017.Idhifa is being evaluated in several phase I dose-escalation studies, evaluating both hematological and solid tumor cancers with IDH2 mutations. Last month, the company announced positive efficacy and safety data from the ongoing phase I dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating Idhifa in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) and an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. Agios and Celgene intend to initiate a high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome study on enasidenib in 2017.Apart from Idhifa, Agios is also planning to initiate a phase III study on AG-120 in front-line AML patients with an IDH1 mutation soon. The company plans to explore a similar regulatory path for AG-120, which could lead to an NDA submission in the U.S. this year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Agios is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate stands and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of $1.52 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Agios has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report), which is scheduled to release results on Aug 8, has an Earnings ESP of +1.89% and a Zacks Rank #3.

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3185,CELG,"Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AERI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company reported a wider-than-expected loss.Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteAerie’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed. The company incurred a narrower-than-expected loss in two of the trailing four quarters while reporting wider-than-expected loss in the remaining two, with an average negative surprise of 3.12%.Aerie’s shares have returned 32.3% over a year compared with the industry’s 3.8% gain.Factors at PlayAerie’s stock received a major boost in December 2017 with the FDA’s approval of lead candidate, Rhopressa 0.02% for the lowering of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.The news was a significant boost for Aerie given that the company had no approved products in its portfolio. The FDA approval comes two months ahead of the scheduled Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of Feb 28, 2018.Glaucoma is one of the largest segments in the global ophthalmic market. According to the National Eye Institute, it is estimated that more than 2.7 million individuals in the United States suffer from glaucoma. This number is expected to reach 4.3 million by 2030.Aerie expects Rhopress revenues in the range of $20-$30 million in 2018. The company recently announced that it has launched the drug in the United States. The company has hired all regional sales directors and district managers as well as more than 30 of an expected 100 territory managers.The company expects to gain preferred formulary coverage for the majority of commercial payers for Rhopressa by late 2018 with most of the Medicare Part D coverage expected to commence in 2019. We expect management to throw more light on the drug’s launch during the first-quarter call.Meanwhile, Aerie’s second product candidate, Roclatan (netarsudil/latanoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.02%/0.005% — which is a fixed dose combination of Rhopressa and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalatan — achieved primary efficacy endpoint in two phase III registration trials, named Mercury 1 and Mercury 2.The candidate also achieved successful 12-month safety and efficacy results in Mercury 1. The company expects to submit its NDA for Roclatan in second-quarter 2018. Investors will also be focussed on Aerie’s update on the same.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Aerie is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen, which is not the case here:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 89 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Aerie has a Zacks Rank #3, which is favorable. However, we need to have a positive ESP as well to be confident of an earnings beat.Note, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on May 4.

3186,CELG,"Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (JAZZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter results on May 8 after market close.Shares of the company have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has rallied 14.6% against the industry’s 2.7% decrease. Jazz has been showcasing a disappointing earnings history of late. The company surpassed estimates only once in the last four quarters, missing the same in the other three with an average beat of 0.79%. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative surprise of 1.01%.Let’s see, how things have shaped up for this last completed quarter:Factors at PlayOn the first-quarter conference call, investors will be attentive toward management’s comments regarding Xyrem’s performance, which is Jazz’s lead product for cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Also, they will be keen to know about the company’s pipeline progress. Its business development plans are also expected to draw notice.Xyrem has witnessed lower-than-expected growth in the second half of 2017 due to negative impact of payer mix and operational changes leading to delayed prescription fulfillment. However, at fourth-quarter conference, management had increased its sales outlook for Xyrem as it anticipates a low to mid-single-digit volume expansion for the drug in 2018. It remains to be seen if this is reflected in Xyrem’s sales performance in the to be reported quarter. Notably, Jazz is striving to expand Xyrem’s label. The company reported positive top-line data from a phase III study on children and adolescents with EDS in mid-2017. Last week, the company submitted a regulatory application for the drug to the FDA for the given indication.The company’s another drug, Defitelio (veno-occlusive disease), was launched in the United States in early April 2016. Though the drug's performance was soft during the first half of 2017, it showed some improvement in the fourth quarter, a trend which we expect to continue in 2018.However, Jazz has been facing challenges in building sufficient inventory levels for another product called Erwinaze due to constrained manufacturing capacity. Also, there might have been supply disruptions in certain markets for the company in the last completed quarter including the United States and beyond.  Noticeably, last reported quarter, the company recorded impressive sales from Vyxeos, launched in August 2017 in the U.S. market for treating adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The drug is expected to generate significant revenues in the to-be-reported quarter as well, given the company’s aggressive commercialization efforts for the same.Also, Jazz’s lead pipeline candidate, JZP-110, complements its existing sleep disorder portfolio. It has been developed for the treatment of EDS. In March 2018, Jazz announced that the FDA accepted the company's regulatory application for JZP-110 with respect to the given indication. A response from the FDA is awaited on Dec 20, 2018.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Jazz is likely to beat estimates this earnings season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Jazz has an Earnings ESP of -1.02%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $2.74 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Jazz has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC Price and EPS Surprise Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC Quote Stocks to ConsiderSome health care stocks with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:Emergent Biosolutions Inc.

3187,CELG,"Intrexon Corporation (XON  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 9, after the market closes.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 45.16%. Intrexon has a mixed surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates thrice while trailing in one, with an average beat of 16.26%.Intrexon’s shares have returned 59% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.3%.Factors to ConsiderIntrexon’s business model helps it commercialize technologies through exclusive channel collaborations (“ECC”), licensing agreements and joint ventures with collaborators that have market and product development expertise as well as sales and marketing capabilities. This facilitates the company to bring new and improved products and processes in the market. These agreements help Intrexon generate funds in the form of technology access fees and milestones, along with other payments.Intrexon is collaborating with various companies for developing several candidates. The company teamed up with Fibrocell Science, Inc. (FCSC  -  Free Report) and completed enrolment in a phase I/II study on FCX-007 for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. In January 2018, Fibrocell received an approval from the FDA to initiate enrollment of pediatric patients in the phase II portion of the phase I/II study of FCX-007.Also, the second gene therapy candidate, FCX-013, is being developed by Fibrocell for the treatment of linear scleroderma.Intrexon’s expanding portfolio of technologies has enabled the company to develop a robust pipeline. The company’s efforts to growth by acquisitions and ECCs are encouraging. Therefore, we expect investor’s focus to remain on the company’s performance along with other developmental updates during the quarterly call.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Intrexon this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to surpass estimates. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -7.22%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 26 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of 24 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intrexon has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on May 4. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc.

3188,CELG,"Drug Approvals and licensing deals were the areas of focus in the biotech space last week. While Gilead’s HCV Drug, Eplcusa, was approved in China, BioMarin’s Palynziq got FDA approval. On the other hand, Alexion’s offer to acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutcis was accepted by the latter’s shareholders.Recap of Important Stories:Gilead’s Epclusa Gets Approval in China: The China Drug Administration (“CDA”) approved Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Epclusa (sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg) for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The CDA also approved Epclusa in combination with ribavirin (RBV) for adults with HCV and decompensated cirrhosis. The approval was based on positive results from five phase III studies, ASTRAL-1, ASTRAL-2, ASTRAL-3, ASTRAL-4 and ASTRAL-5, wherein high overall rates of SVR12 (defined as undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completing therapy) in the range of 92-100%, were achieved across difficult-to-cure patient populations including treatment-experienced patients and those with compensated or decompensated cirrhosis. The approval will further expand Gilead’s geographic reach and somewhat boost its dwindling HCV portfolio.Gilead is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

In March 2018, the European Medicines Agency also accepted the company’s Marketing Authorization Application for Palynziq. In the United States, Palynziq is the first enzyme therapy approved for the treatment of PKU. The drug will complement sales of BioMarin’s other drug Kuvan.Alexion’s offer For Wilson Acquisition Accepted:  Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) announced that its offer to acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics has been accepted by its shareholders, who represent 97.7% of the total number of shares and votes in the latter. The acquisition has also been approved by relevant regulatory authorities. The settlement of the tendered shares will occur on May 30. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101, to Alexion’s pipeline as the company looks to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug Soliris. WTX101 enjoys Fast Track designation in the United States. and Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of Wilson disease in the United States and Europe Union.Cara Therapeutics Gains on Licensing Deal: Shares of Cara Therapeutics, Inc. (CARA  -  Free Report) jumped significantly last week following the announcement of a licensing deal with Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma Ltd. The company licensed worldwide rights, to commercialize Korsuva (CR845/difelikefalin) injection for the treatment of chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) in dialysis patients except in the United States, Japan and South Korea.

3189,CELG,"Shares of Prothena Corporation (PRTA  -  Free Report) were down 1.62% a day after the company announced a reorganization plan. Prothena’s stock has lost 67.3% in the last six months, worse than the industry’s decline of 7.8%.The company has decided to reduce its workforce by approximately 57% as a result of the discontinuation of the lead candidate, NEOD001.We remind investors that NEOD001, an antibody, was being evaluated for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. A phase IIb study, PRONTO, did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Hence, the company asked the independent data monitoring committee (“DMC”) of the phase III VITAL study to review a futility analysis of the ongoing VITAL study. Thereafter, the DMC recommended discontinuation of the VITAL study. Consequently, the company decided to discontinue all studies for the development of NEOD001, including the VITAL study as well as the open label extension studies.Earlier, Prothena announced disappointing results from a phase Ib multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of pipeline candidate, PRX003 in psoriasis patients. The primary objectives of the study were achieved. However, advancing PRX003 into mid-stage clinical development required a well-defined relationship between biological activity and meaningful clinical effects and these prerequisites were not met.Prothena expects its workforce to be approximately 63 positions after the plan is executed.The company plans to align its resources on advancing its remaining candidates of its neuroscience pipeline, PRX002/RG7935, being developed in collaboration with Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) and its proprietary program PRX004 as well as its discovery-stage pipeline. The discovery-stage lineup includes a proprietary program targeting Aβ and three programs being advanced as part of a neuroscience R&D collaboration with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), including tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed target.Consequently, Prothena revised its full-year 2018 financial guidance and now expects its 2018 net cash burn from operating and investing activities to be $40 to $50 million.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderProthena currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Ligand Pharmaceuticals  (LGND  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3190,CELG,"We issued an updated research report on Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) on May 23.Agios’ only marketed drug is Idhifa, which received FDA approval for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation, in August 2017. However, apart from Idhifa, Agios does not have any approved product in its portfolio yet. Hence, the company’s top line mainly comprises collaboration revenues and milestone payments.Year to date, shares of the company have increased 55.6%, compared with the industry’s increase of 7.2%.The company has several interesting candidates in its pipeline. Its lead cancer pipeline includes Tibsovo (ivosidenib/AG-120; under the priority review in the United States), the most advanced candidate targeting mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). In December 2017, Agios submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for Tibsovo (ivosidenib), which has been developed for treating patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation.Subsequently, in February 2018, the FDA accepted the NDA under priority review for the given indication. The FDA has set an action date of Aug 21, 2018. A regulatory filing for the candidate in the European Union is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the same indication.Its other candidates include AG-881, which targets both mutated IDH1 and mutated IDH2. These mutations are found in a wide range of hematological malignancies and solid tumors including AML, chondrosarcoma and cholangiocarcinoma, where both the treatment options and prognosis for patients are poor.The company's lead rare genetic diseases candidate, AG-348, is under evaluation in a phase II study on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. During the first quarter of 2018, the company initiated ACTIVATE-T, a single-arm pivotal study for AG-348, in adult PK deficiency patients who receive regular blood transfusions. In fact, the company plans to initiate another study -ACTIVATE, for AG-348 in adults with PK deficiency who do not receive regular blood transfusions in the second quarter of 2018.Another candidate, AG-270, a first-in-class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) inhibitor, is being evaluated in a phase I dose-escalation study in patients with methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deleted tumors.A potential approval for the pipeline candidates will be a huge boost for the company.In May 2016, Agios and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) announced a new global strategic collaboration for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies utilizing Agios’ innovative cellular metabolism research platform. Terms of the Celgene deal are lucrative as Agios is eligible to receive clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments plus royalties on net sales of products resulting under the collaboration.However, the company depends heavily on Celgene for revenues, which it earns in the form of collaboration revenues. The company also faces stiff competition.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAgioshas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Illumina, Inc.

3191,CELG,"bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Lenti-D for the treatment of patients with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD). We note that the Breakthrough Therapy designation expedites the development and review of drugs intended as a standalone therapy or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease when preliminary data suggest that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.The designation is supported by positive preliminary data from the ongoing phase II/III Starbeam Study (ALD-102) evaluating Lenti-D investigational gene therapy in boys with CALD, 17 years of age or less who do not have a matched sibling donor.  The two-year study has assessed the safety and efficacy of this investigational gene therapy. CALD is a hereditary neurological disorder.We note that Lenti-D investigational gene therapy enjoys orphan drug status in the Unites States and Europe. The drug was also granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation by the FDA for the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).Per the FDA’s Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, a sponsor who receives a marketing application approval for a rare pediatric indication is generally eligible for a Priority Review Voucher, which can be redeemed to obtain Priority Review for a subsequent marketing application for a different product.bluebird bio has built a diverse pipeline with its lentiviral-based gene therapies, T cell immunotherapy expertise and gene editing capabilities. bluebird bio’s gene therapy clinical programs include Lenti-D for the treatment of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and LentiGlobin for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, also known as β-thalassemia major, and severe sickle cell disease.The oncology pipeline primarily focuses on developing novel T cell-based immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR T) and T cell receptor (TCR) therapies.  The lead oncology programs include bb2121 and bb21217. Both these are anti-BCMA CAR T programs which the company is developing in partnership with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report).CAR T therapies are in focus since 2017 with the approval of Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah. In the past six months, bluebird’s stock has returned 12.9% against a 8.7% decline registered by the industry.Zacks Rankbluebird carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3192,CELG,"Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPRX  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 9, after the market closes. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the estimates. It topped expectations in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 8.34%.Year to date, Catalyst’s shares have decreased 26.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderCatalyst does not have any revenue-generating product in its portfolio. Investor’s focus will be on pipeline and regulatory updates during the first-quarter earnings call. Currently, the company has three candidates under development namely Firdapse, CPP-115 and CPP-109.Catalyst’s lead pipeline candidate Firdapse has been developed for the symptomatic treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (“LEMS”). In February 2018, the company announced positive top-line results from a second phase III study of Firdapse. The study achieved statistical significance for both its co-primary endpoints — quantitative myasthenia gravis score (“QMG”) and subject global impression (“SGI”) and secondary endpoint. The top-line results showed that Firdapse has a significant magnitude of effect for treating the symptoms of LEMS.  The company met with the FDA for a Type C meeting in February 2018 for getting Firdapse approved for LEMS. The minutes of the meeting received from the FDA reflect the FDA's advice to Catalyst that its proposed filing package will be sufficient for resubmission of an NDA for Firdapse. In March 2018, Catalyst submitted a NDA to the FDA which addressed the two issues raised in the 2016 Refusal to File letter and included all additional information requested by the FDA.  We remind investors that the FDA had given a Refusal to File letter when the company submitted a NDA in 2016 and asked for additional information.Additionally, the company is working on developing Firdapse for additional indications. In April 2018, the company  enrolled first patient in its phase III study for MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis. The company expects that the trial will take about 12 months to complete and therefore it expects to announce topline results in the first half of 2019.In the second half of 2018, the company expects to report top-line data from its ongoing clinical trial evaluating Firdapse for the treatment of congenital myasthenic syndromes (“CMS”).Apart from Firdapse, Catalyst is also exploring the possibility of developing CPP-115 (a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor) for the treatment of epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and the other selected neurological indications such as complex partial seizures and Tourette’s disorder.Moreover, the company is working on a Lundbeck’s generic version of Sabril (vigabatrin), for the treatment of infantile spasms and complex partial seizures.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Catalyst this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Catalyst has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 6 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Catalyst carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

3193,CELG,"The biotech sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately. This sector is expected to continue benefiting from increased M&A activities, new drug approvals, better R&D and innovations.Although the sector took a beating last year owing to drug-price controls and Trump’s plans of tackling the ever-surging drug prices getting highlighted in his latest budget, growing demand for drugs, especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending should benefit the industry.U.S. Economy BackdropU.S. markets recently suffered a sell-off owing to fears of rising rates. The S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. Strong wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes.Consumer prices increased 2.1% year over year in January, unchanged from the previous month but above economists’ forecasts of 1.9%. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s tax reform and spending deal might create further pressure on prices. Hence, the Fed is expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation.Jerome Powell’s testimony was seen indicative of the possibility of Fed raising rates more than three times in 2018. “In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation to 2% on a sustained basis,” per a Financial Times article, citing a statement by Powell.As such, when the markets are suffering from the anticipated rate hikes, the non-cyclical nature of biotech stocks might seem appealing to investors. Moreover, encouraging industry trends and positive earnings are poised to benefit the ETFs exposed to the said sector (read: Biotech Crushing the Market: Best ETFs & Stocks YTD).Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to the biotech space and tracks the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index. It has AUM of $4.9 billion and charges a fee of 35 basis points a year. It has 108 holdings and bears less concentration risk as less than 19% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.The fund’s top three holdings are Bioverativ Inc. , Array BioPharma Inc. (ARRY  -  Free Report) and Juno Therapeutics Inc. , with 2.8%, 2.2% and 2.0% allocation, respectively (as of Feb 26, 2018).  The fund has returned 31.2% in a year and 5.6% year to date. XBI has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), with a High risk outlook.iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to biotech space and tracks the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index. It has AUM of $9.4 billion and charges a fee of 47 basis points a year. It has 196 holdings and bears concentration risk as more than 52% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.The fund’s top three holdings Are Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD  -  Free Report), Amgen Inc (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Celgene Corp (CELG  -  Free Report), with 8.3%, 8.1% and 7.2% allocation, respectively (as of Feb 26, 2018). The fund has returned 11.1% in a year and 0.7% year to date. IBB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a High risk outlook.Bottom LineIBB is more popular than XBI, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, XBI may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio and a better Zacks rank.At the same time, XBI has significantly outperformed IBB when it comes to performance. XBI has returned almost 5.0% more than IBB so far this year, whereas in a year, it outperformed IBB by more than 20.0%. However, investors should note that XBI is focused on providing exposure to small-cap stocks in the space, while IBB is more inclined toward the large-cap players.  Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Hence, Celgene will request a Type A meeting with the FDA to ascertain the additional information needed for resubmission of the NDA.The news comes as a great disappointment for investors as Celgene is taking desperate attempts to bolster its portfolio and reduce overdependence on lead drug, Revlimid.

On the other hand, Kite will be responsible for all development, manufacturing and commercialization of products under the collaboration. Sangamo shares skyrocketed to a high of $25.40 on the news of the collaboration as investors had lots to cheer for given Gilead’s expertise in the biotech field.CHMP Positive on Amgen’s Xgeva Label Expansion: The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency has given a positive opinion to expand the current indication for Amgen’s Xgeva to include skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma. Given the positive results of the phase III study, ‘482, the candidate should get approval for the aforementioned indication.The study results showed Xgeva successfully met the primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first on-study skeletal-related event in patients with multiple myeloma. The FDA already approved the company’s Supplemental Biologics License Application for XGEVA to expand the currently approved indication for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors to include patients with multiple myeloma in January 2018.Vertex Initiates Phase III Triple Combination Study for CF: Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report), a leader in cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market, announced the initiation of a phase III study, VX-659, tezacaftor and Kalydeco as an investigational triple combination regimen for patients suffering from CF who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation. The study is being conducted to support the submission of a NDA in the United States using data from the four-week primary efficacy endpoint together with safety data through 12 weeks of treatment.Earlier in the month, the FDA approved Symdeko for the treatment of the underlying cause of CF in patients aged 12 or older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene or who have at least one mutation that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return  Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 0.79% over the last five trading sessions.

3195,CELG,"After rising 16.3% last year, the Large Cap Pharmaceutical industry has risen 1.9% this year so far. It has however underperformed the 4% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.Though the sector was off to a strong start in 2018, it struggled a little thereafter probably on broader market correction. Also, the mention of high drug prices by President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address hurt investor sentiment. However, the sector is largely expected to rebound as the year progresses.2017 was a good year for pharma and biotech stocks with the sector witnessing some positive developments that led to a much-awaited recovery.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 11.8% in 2017, in sharp contrast to the decline witnessed in 2016, which was a tough year for pharma stocks given the furor over rising drug prices.A key reason for the sector’s improved performance was the willingness of investors to look beyond the drug pricing controversy and focus more on fundamentals instead. Although the drug pricing controversy will remain a headline risk, investors appear more comfortable with the issue. Moreover, a significantly higher number of FDA approvals in 2017 restored investor confidence in the sector. The approval of the first gene cell therapy last year was a major breakthrough for the sector.Coming back to 2018, we believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals, continued strong performance from key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also provide benefits.Possibilities of more mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are also high now that the tax reform is in place and big players are on the lookout for companies with innovative pipelines/technology. There has already been quite a bit of M&A buzz this year about potential deals. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) have already announced two deals each.Meanwhile, with the Large-Cap Pharma industry being among the top 30% of the 256 Zacks-ranked industries, it would make sense to look at some Buy-ranked stocks in the space.Investing in stocks with a large market cap is a much more reliable investment because of the fact that they control a large portion of their given industry. Also companies with a larger market cap have performed well in 2017 and look well poised to earn higher profits in 2018.Here is a look at four large-cap pharma companies that sport a favorable Zacks Rank -- #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).H. Lundbeck A/S (HLUYY  -  Free Report)Denmark-based Lundbeck specializes in psychiatric and neurological disorders. The company’s key areas of focus include depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. According to Lundbeck, about 700 million people across the world suffer from psychiatric and neurological disorders with many receiving inadequate treatment.YTD, Lundbeck has outperformed the Large-Cap Pharmaceutical industry with shares gaining 4.7%. In addition to delivering revenue growth of 12% (in local currencies) in 2017, Lundbeck issued an upbeat outlook for 2018. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 31.2%. Meanwhile, earnings estimates for 2019 are up 8.5% over the past 30 days.AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)AbbVie beat estimates for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter. It also raised its earnings expectations for 2018 based on continued strong operational performance. AbbVie’s key drug, Humira has been performing well based on strong demand trends, despite new competition. AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry in the past year, supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory nods, including approval for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and two approvals for Imbruvica, and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with biotech major, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).AbbVie’s shares are up an impressive 22.3% this year so far, outperforming the industry.Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 33.9%. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 8.4% and 7% respectively, over the past 30 days.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)New York-based, Pfizer is one of the most well-known names in the pharmaceutical sector not just for its medicines and vaccines but also for its consumer healthcare products.Pfizer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 results as it beat estimates for earnings as well as sales and provided an upbeat outlook for 2018. We believe that Pfizer’snew products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost cuts and share buybacks should help the company earn profits in the future quarters. Pfizer’s shares have risen 1.6% this year so far.Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 11.3%. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 are up 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively, over the past 30 days.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report)The year 2017 was eventful for this Denmark-based pharma giant as it gained regulatory approvals for some key pipeline drugs/candidates including fast-acting insulin aspart - Fiasp, once-daily pre-filled pen - Ozempic and hemophilia B treatment Rebinyn. Meanwhile, strong performance of Victoza is driving top-line growth. We believe these new products and a solid pipeline will pave the way for growth this year for the company.Over the past 30 days, earnings estimates have risen 1.5% and 4.9%, respectively, for 2018 and 2019. Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 13.7%.While Pfizer, AbbVie and Novo Nordisk are all Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks, Lundbeck is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

3196,CELG,"BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25 after market close. BioMarin delivered a negative earnings surprise of 25.0% in the last quarter.BioMarin’s earnings track record has been decent, with the company beating estimates in three of the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 63.71%.BioMarin shares have declined 8% this year so far. This compares favorably with 9.1% decrease registered by the industry during this period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayKey orphan disease drugs, Vimizim and Kuvan, which drove BioMarin’s top line in the past few quarters, are likely to maintain the trend this quarter too. Robust patient growth and penetration should propel the drugs’ sales.Also, Naglazyme and Vimzin revenues vary on a quarterly basis, primarily due to inconsistent ordering patterns from some countries. On the fourth quarter 2017 conference call, the company had said that it is cautiously optimistic that sales in Brazil will be steady in 2018 but uneven buying patterns may be observed quarter to quarter.Nevertheless, the drugs continue to witness steady patient growth and we expect the trend to continue this quarter.We expect management to discuss how the pipeline is progressing on the conference call. Brineura, for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease – a form of Batten disease  – was approved in both the United States and EU last year.  Brineura generated sales of around $9 million in 2017. On the Q4 call, the company said that the focus on the initial stages of launch is on disease awareness and early diagnosis The company mentioned that new site readiness can take longer than expected, which suggests slower revenue ramp up.On the Q1 investor call, we also expect management to comment on the launch preparation for pegvaliase. Pegvaliase, developed for treating phenylketonuria (PKU), is under review in the United States with the FDA expected to give its decision in May.Regarding pegvaliase launch, on the Q4 call management had informed that the initial sales ramp-up of pegvaliase would be slow due to education on disease awareness and lower doses per patient in the induction titration phase.  Also, the company mentioned that it expects to price pegvaliase at a modest premium to Kuvan (net annual treatment cost of about $150,000). An update is expected at the upcoming call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BioMarin is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -17.99% as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is 13 cents while the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged lower at 10 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BioMarin’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Apr 26, has an Earnings ESP of +2.09% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amgen, Inc.

The company is scheduled to release results on Apr 24.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on May 4.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

3197,CELG,"We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.Vertex’s shares have increased 5.9% so far this year while the industry has recorded a decrease of 9%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 25.31%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 5.17%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayVertex’s cystic fibrosis (""CF"") drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — performed consistently in 2017, with sales rising almost 30%. We expect this positive trend to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, the company announced on its last quarter earnings call that first-quarter revenues will be unfavorably impacted by higher gross to net revenue adjustments and buildup of channel inventory in the fourth quarter of 2017.In January 2018, Vertex announced that an extension of the marketing application for Orkambi was approved in Europe. With the approval, Orkambi’s marketing label in EU will now include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation, expanding patient population by about 3,400. The expanded patient population is expected to boost sales of the drug. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orkambi’s sales in the first quarter is $368 million.In 2017, Kalydeco received approval for two line extensions including in patients 2 years and older with certain residual mutations in CFTR gene. The drug generated significant sales last year due to rapid uptake in expanded patient population and we expect the trend to continue. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter Kalydeco sales is pegged at $228 millionIn a boost to Vertex’s CF franchise, the FDA approved Vertex’s third CF drug, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, in February 2018. The drug is under review in Europe. However, we expect the new drug to contribute minimally to first-quarter sales. We expect the company to provide update on Symdeko’s commercialization plan and its initial uptake.The company remains focused on development of its triple-combination regimens. During the quarter, Vertex advanced VX-659 and VX-445 for phase III development. Also, two phase III studies were initiated, evaluating VX-659 in combination with tezacaftor and Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in CF patients.Investor focus on the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth of Vertex. The company is also likely to provide full year revenue guidance including Symdeko sales on the call.However, operating expenses are likely to be on the higher side due to initiation of two pivotal studies and launch of Symdeko.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Vertex is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (62 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (57 cents), stands at +8.28%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vertex has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its results on May 4.

3198,CELG,"Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data on multiple sclerosis (“MS”) drug Ocrevus at the 70th American Academy of Neurology (“AAN”) Annual Meeting, held from Apr 21-27 in Los Angeles, CA. The data revealed the efficacy of Ocrevus in relapsing multiple sclerosis (“RMS”) through several measures of underlying disease activity and disability progression, including magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), cognitive function, and spinal fluid biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration.The data showed that four years of continuous treatment with Ocrevus showed a sustained reduction in underlying disease activity in RMS from the open-label extension period.Patients who continued with Ocrevus maintained low numbers of T1 gadolinium-enhancing (T1Gd+) lesions (0.017 pre-OLE to 0.17 T1Gd+ lesions per scan at year four [year two of the OLE phase]) and new/enlarging T2 (N/ET2) lesions [0.052 pre-OLE to 0.080 N/ET2 lesions per scan] through year two of the OLE phase.The safety data was consistent with the drug’s favorable benefit-risk profile in both relapsing and primary progressive multiple sclerosis.Additonally, a second four-year analysis presented in a poster at AAN also revealed that patients who stayed on Ocrevus through year two of the OLE period sustained low annualized relapse rates  and 24-week confirmed disability progression.Those who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus experienced a significant decline in ARR by year one that was maintained through year two. Further, Ocrevus reduced the risk of 12- and 24-week confirmed cognitive decline (as defined by confirmed worsening on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test of at least four points) by 38 and 39% (p≤0.001 and p=0.002, respectively) during the 96-week period in people with RMS, compared to interferon beta-1a.Pooled data from phase III studies, OPERA I and OPERA II data, showed that patients with RMS at increased risk of progressive disease (as determined by baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale and pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems scores of at least four and two points, respectively) and treated with Ocrevus experienced a significant improvement in cognitive function compared with those taking interferon beta-1a through 96 weeks.In March 2017, the FDA approved Ocrevus to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. However, there were uncertainties over Ocrevus being a new innovation or a reformulation of Roche’s older drug Rituxan. The drug sales aren’t that impressive yet either.  Roche’s stock has lost 10.6% over a year, as against the industry's gain of 8.7%.Last week, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) also announced encouraging data from the phase III study, EXPAND, on oral, once-daily siponimod (BAF312) in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (“SPMS”).Given the complexity of the market, MS drugs have a long history of serious side effects, making it a risky therapeutic area.  An autoimmune inflammatory disease of the centrol nervous system, MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss. There are three types of MS widely known to affect adults — relapsing-remitting MS, SPMS and primary progressive MS.Competition is also stiff in the market. Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the MS market with drugs like Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera, Plegridy and Zinbryta.  The FDA recently issued Refusal to File letter to Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) New Drug Application for ozanimod, which is in development for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3199,CELG,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced encouraging data from the phase III study, EXPAND, on oral, once-daily siponimod (BAF312) in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (“SPMS”).Siponimod is an investigational, selective modulator of specific subtypes of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor.The results will be presented at the 70th American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, in Los Angeles which is scheduled to be held from Apr 21 to 27.The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, EXPAND study is comparing the efficacy and safety of siponimod versus placebo in SPMS patients.Data from the study showed that siponimod reduced the risk of disability progression largely disassociated from relapses in patients with SPMS.New post-hoc analysis also demonstrated that the risk reduction with siponimod is largely disassociated from relapses. The data from the study showed that siponimod resulted in significant benefit on cognitive processing speed, the key cognitive function impacted by MS which impacted the affected patients.Meanwhile, Novartis has initiated the submission of siponimod in the United States for the approval in SPMS. Filing for EU approval is planned to follow later in 2018.A potential approval will strengthen Novartis’ MS portfolio which includes Gilenya (fingolimod, an S1P modulator) approved for relapsing forms of MS and is also in development for pediatric MS. Extavia (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) is approved in the United States for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS.Novartis also has another MS candidate in its pipeline apart from siponimod- ofatumumab (OMB157), a fully human monoclonal antibody being evaluated in two phase III studies for relapsing MS. The generic division, Sandoz, markets Glatopa (glatiramer acetate injection) 20 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL, generic versions of Teva's (TEVA  -  Free Report) Copaxone.Given the complexity of the market, MS drugs have a long history of serious side effects, making it a risky therapeutic area.  An autoimmune inflammatory disease of the centrol nervous system, MS disrupts the normal functioning of the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss.

3200,CELG,"We expect biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, after market close. Amgen delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.93% in the last quarter.Amgen shares have declined 0.6% in the past year. Still, this compares favorably with the 8.4% decrease registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been modest, with the company delivering a positive surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 2.93%.Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayThe first-quarter usually generates the lowest product sales for Amgen.Amgen’s newer products like Prolia, Kyprolis, Xgeva and Blincyto are likely to perform well backed by higher demand. This will make up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.In 2017 and early 2018, Amgen gained FDA approval to include overall survival data in the labels for Kyprolis and Blincyto, which may reflect in first-quarter sales of these drugs. In January, Xgeva gained FDA approval for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma. The label extension can boost sales of the drug.Neulasta demand is being hurt by competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapiesNeupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States, mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of NeupogenWe expect Neulasta and Neupogen first-quarter sales to be hurt by competitive dynamics. Neulasta and Epogen are expected to start facing biosimilar competition in the United States this year. Also, Sensipar sales are likely to decline sharply the soon-to-be reported quarter as the drug lost patent exclusivity in March 2018.Enbrel sales are expected to be hurt by increased pricing and competitive pressure. Enbrel is one of the main drivers of Amgen’s revenues.On the fourth-quarter conference call, Amgen said that sales of Enbrel in the first quarter are expected to be the lowest in 2018, representing approximately 20% of full-year sales. Also Repatha sales in the first quarter are expected to be relatively flat sequentially hurt by insurance verifications and patient out-of-pocket costs. Also investors will be keen to know if sales of Repatha have improved with the inclusion of FOURIER outcomes data on its label.Amgen and partner Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug Avastin, Mvasi was approved in EU in January, which should boost first-quarter sales of the drug.Investor focus on the call will be on management’s comments on the preparations for the potential launch of migraine candidate, Aimovig. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Aimovig biologics license application (BLA) in mid-May.Meanwhile, higher investments to support product launches is likely to result in higher SG&A costs in the to-be reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($3.34 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($3.23 per share) is +3.34%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderBiotech stocks that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank include:Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3201,CELG,"Biotechnology sector, which includes the fast-growing companies in the health care world, are easily crushing the overall market and broader health care sector so far this year. This is especially thanks to a wave of mergers and acquisitions, encouraging trends as well as the new tax legislation.Mergers & AcquisitionsRecent mergers and acquisition talks/rumors have given a boost to biotech stocks. Celgene Corp (CELG  -  Free Report) has agreed to buy Juno Therapeutics Inc.  for $87 per share in cash, or $9 billion, while Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced a deal to acquire Bioverativ  for $11.6 billion.Given the flurry of deals so far, M&A activity in the biotech sector is expected to be robust this year. EY expects the deal value to exceed $200 billion, given companies’ increased financial firepower and balance sheet strength (read: M&A Waves Pushing Biotech ETFs Higher).Encouraging TrendsThe industry is clearly benefiting from solid corporate earnings, promising drug launches, faster drug approvals, cost-cutting efforts, an aging population, ever-increasing healthcare spending, expansion into emerging markets and Trump’s tax reform. In particular, the new tax legislation has enticed companies to bring offshore cash back home at reduced tax rates of 8-15.5% instead of the prior 35%. The repatriated money could be used for share buybacks, dividends, acquisitions and capital spending.Additionally, the sector’s non-cyclical nature is an advantage in the current environment, where concerns over higher inflation and the resultant increase in interest rates are on the rise. Geopolitical tensions, Washington turmoil as well as the prospect of an end to the worldwide cheap money policy era is also compelling investors to move toward defensive sectors like health care (see: all the Health care ETFs here).How to Play?All these developments are fueling growth in the biotech companies, leading to a rally in their share prices and impressive levels of momentum in biotech ETFs. This suggests that a tilt toward biotech is definitely a good idea.Below, we highlight the three biotech ETFs & stocks that have delivered double-digit returns in the year-to-date time frame. These could be excellent plays for investors who believe that biotech will continue to move upward, and continue to lead the health care space higher in the months ahead.Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report)This product tracks the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Index and provides exposure to a basket of companies that develop therapies to treat cancer by harnessing the body’s own immune system.

3202,CELG,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter 2017 loss of $1.59 per share, narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.74 and the year-ago loss of $1.63.Agios’ shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The company’s shares have surged 48.6% compared with the industry’s increase of 21.2%. In August, Agios along with partner Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted an approval to its lead candidate, Idhifa (enasidenib) for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. However, apart from Idhifa, Agios lacks any sanctioned product in its portfolio. Hence, the company’s top line mainly comprises collaboration revenues and royalty revenues.Total revenues in the third quarter amounted to $11.4 million, marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11 million. The top line surged 26.7% from the year-ago figure of $9 million. This swell in revenues is primarily attributable to reimbursement from Celgene for Idhifa’s commercialization efforts in the United States and royalty revenues gained from Idhifa.Research & development expenses jumped 20.3% year over year to $72.9 million. This increase was largely driven by escalated costs associated with the ivosidenib program.General and administrative expenses climbed 47% year over year to $17.5 million due to higher costs related to Idhifa’s launch and the potential launch of ivosidenib in 2018.Pipeline UpdatesAgios has several candidates in its pipeline, including an IDH1 mutant inhibitor, ivosidenib (AG-120) and pan-IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881.In June, Agios presented positive data from dose escalation and expansion cohorts of the phase I study, evaluating single agent ivosidenib in mutant-positive cholangiocarcinoma at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) Annual Meeting.Agios also initiated a phase III study to evaluate ivosidenib in front-line AML patients with an IDH1 mutant-positive advanced cholangiocarcinoma. The FDA granted an orphan drug designation to ivosidenib for treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. The company said that it is on track to submit a new drug application (“NDA”) to the FDA for ivosidenib by this year-end.Additionally, Agios is conducting phase I studies on another pipeline candidate, AG-881, for treatment of patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors, including glioma.Notably, the company also plans to initiate a perioperative ‘window’ study to evaluate ivosidenib and AG-881 in low grade glioma for investigating their effects on brain tumor tissue in the first half of 2018.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3203,CELG,"Major biotech companies reported earnings results over the last five trading days. While companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) topped expectations, it was a mixed quarter for companies like Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), Alexion (Read more: Alexion Tops Q3 Earnings, Lags Sales, 2017 View Up) and BioMarin (Read more: BioMarin Q3 Loss Narrows, Profit Guidance Raised).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Earnings Results: It was all about earnings this week with several key names reporting third quarter results.

Under the deal, signed in February 2015, Sanofi had an exclusive option for ex-U.S. development and commercial rights to VY-AADC. The deal terms included upfront payments of $100 million as well as future potential development and sales milestone payments of up to $745 million, plus tiered royalties on product sales.According to Voyager, Sanofi decided to exit the deal as the option did not include rights in the United States. With Voyager gaining global rights to the VY-AADC program for advanced Parkinson’s disease, the company said that it remains on track to dose the first patient during the second quarter of 2018.GW Finishes Rolling Drug Submission for Epilepsy Drug: GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the rolling submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) in the United States for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. LGS and Dravet syndrome are two highly treatment-resistant forms of childhood-onset epilepsy and GW has Rare Pediatric Disease and Orphan Drug designations for both indications in the United States. The Dravet syndrome indication has fast track status as well from the FDA. Timely approval would allow the company to launch the product in 2018.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 3.3% over the last five trading sessions.

3204,CELG,"On Apr 17, 2018, we issued an updated report on Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report), a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on development of treatments for cancer and rare genetic metabolic disorders (RGD), a subset of orphan genetic metabolic diseases.Shares of Agios have soared 51.9% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s increase of 2.8%. Agios’ only marketed drug is Idhifa, which received an FDA approval last August for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. The approval lent a huge boost to the company on the back of its immense commercial potential in the target market. Moreover, Idhifa provides a first-ever treatment, alternative to patients living with the aforementioned indication in the United States. Notably, Idhifa also enjoys an Orphan Drug status in the EU for treating AML.Agios’ progress with the pipeline has been quite impressive. The company has some interesting candidates in its portfolio including an IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AG-120 (ivosidenib) and a pan-IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881.Ivosidenib is presently under priority review in the United States for treating patients with R/R AML with an IDH1 mutation. An approval for ivosidenib is expected in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, the company anticipates a regulatory filing for the candidate in the EU in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the same indication.Ivosidenib is also being evaluated in phase I study for addressing advanced hematologic malignancies and in phase I/II combined with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Vidaza for the cure of newly diagnosed AML patients, who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.Meanwhile, Agios is conducting phase I programs on AG-881 for treating patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors including glioma. Last October, the company announced positive findings from the study.Notably, the company also plans to initiate a perioperative window study to analyze ivosidenib and AG-881 in low grade glioma for investigating the effects on brain tumor tissue in the first half of 2018.The company has another interesting candidate in its portfolio. Its lead rare genetic diseases candidate, AG-348, is under evaluation in a phase II trial on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase deficiency. Agios reported positive data from the program in June 2017. The FDA granted a fast track designation to the candidate for the given indication. As the RGD market is still untapped, newer therapies in this area hold huge potential.Successful development and commercialization of the above investigational candidates should boost the company’s top line going forward, considering the lucrative markets that it is targeting.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus | Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Zacks Rank & Key PicksAgios carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3205,CELG,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) is the latest company to join the ongoing acquisitions spree in the biotech sector. The company recently announced that it will acquire Sweden-based Wilson Therapeutics.Details of The TransactionAlexion has offered SEK 232 in cash for each outstanding share of Wilson Therapeutics which translates into a total transaction value of $855 million. Alexion has already obtained shareholder support agreements from the four largest shareholders accounting for 57.4% of Wilson Therapeutics’ outstanding shares and two additional shareholders accounting for 8.7% for a total of 66.1% of the company’s outstanding shares. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter.Rationale Behind the TransactionThe acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, WTX101 to Alexion’s pipeline. The candidate is currently in phase III for the treatment of Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder. The candidate is a first-in-class oral copper-binding agent with a unique mechanism of action and ability to access and bind copper from serum and promote its removal from the liver. The candidate has also obtained Fast Track designation in the United States and enjoys Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of Wilson disease in the United States and EU.   Our TakeAlexion is looking to diversify its portfolio and reduce its dependence on its blockbuster drug Soliris. The deal will strengthen Alexion’s rare disease pipeline with a late-stage candidate.However, investors weren’t much impressed with the news as the acquisition adds a candidate to the pipeline and not an approved drug. Thus, the stock lost 2.35% following the announcement. Moreover, the market opportunity for such a rare disease will be limited and might not boost the top-line as expected.  Alexion’s shares have lost 21.7% in the last six months, compared with the industry’s decline of 16.2%.Of late, quite a few biotech companies have been looking to strengthen their portfolio/pipeline. While 2017 was pretty ho-hum on this front with just a few key deals, 2018 is expected to see a surge in M&A primarily due to lower U.S. tax rates.  Taking a clue from Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) acquisition of Kite Pharma, Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) recently acquired Juno Therapeutics to gain traction in the promising CAR-T space.  Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) acquired Bioverativ Inc. which focuses on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders.Zacks Rank Alexion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3206,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that it will acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion.Per the terms of agreement, Impact Biomedicines’ shareholders will receive contingent payments based on regulatory approval and sales-based milestones. The maximum aggregate amount payable for such milestone payments is $1.4 billion.  The aggregate tiered sales-based milestone payments could total to a maximum of $4.5 billion if global annual net sales exceed $5.0 billion.The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF) and polycythemia vera. Fedratinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary endpoints of splenic response and total symptom score, respectively in a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III pivotal trial (JAKARTA-1) for treatment-naïve MF.In addition, a multi-center, single-arm phase II trial (JAKARTA-2) evaluated fedratinib in MF patients who were found to be resistant or intolerant to Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) Jakafi which is another a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. Fedratinib demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in splenic response and total symptom score in this second-line setting.However, we remind investors that JAKARTA-2 was stopped prematurely as the FDA put a clinical hold on the fedratinib program. The hold was put after potential cases of Wernicke’s encephalopathy were reported in eight out of 877 patients receiving one or more doses (less than one percent of treated patients). The FDA withdrew the clinical hold in August 2017. Based on the reported benefit risk profile of fedratinib from the JAKARTA-1 and JAKARTA-2 clinical trials, regulatory applications in MF are planned beginning the middle of 2018.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017.Celgene’s stock has declined 20.4% of its value in the last six months compared with the industry’s loss of 1.9%.Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback last week when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed.The study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared with the standard of care featuring Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-VN CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. In 2016, the drug’s worldwide sales increased 20% to $7.0 billion and contributed almost 62.1% of the total revenues. Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma.The failure of the study is disappointing. The drug’s label expansion would have boosted its sales potential.In addition, in October 2017, the company announced a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) were discontinued following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis.Meanwhile, the deep, yet persistently slow growth of the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis markets, especially during the entire third quarter, has led to a weak performance of Otezla. Consequently, the company also reduced its annual guidance. The challenging market conditions were driven by an increasingly restrictive PBM formulary control.On a positive note, in August 2017, the company obtained an FDA approval for Idhifa for treatment of relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The drug was developed in partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AGIO  -  Free Report).Big biotechs are looking for strategic acquisitions to bolster their portfolio and pipeline.

3207,CELG,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) stock was up 21.3% in 2017, which compared favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry.Last year’s share price surge was supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies and rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions. The positive trend is likely to continue this year as well.What Drove the Stock in 2017?Two new drugs were approved last year - Guselkumab/Tremfya in the United States as well as in the EU for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States. Juluca is under review in the EU.J&J also gained FDA approval for several line extensions -  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive their sales higher in future quarters.In 2017, J&J also submitted regulatory applications for label expansion of key drugs including Darzalex (in first-line setting for multiple myeloma), Xarelto (for chronic coronary artery disease and/or peripheral artery disease), Invokana (to include the cardiovascular indication), Zytiga (for earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer). It might get FDA nod for these line extensions this year.Factors Likely to Support the Rally in 2018With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is likely to continue in 2018.This year J&J expects to file for approval of depression candidate, esketamine while apalutamide for pre-metastatic prostate cancer and Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for HIV could be approved by the FDA.J&J’s domestic Pharma segment sales decelerated in the first half of 2017 as a number of key growth drivers like Remicade and Concerta faced competition. However, sales growth accelerated in the third quarter and we are likely to see the positive impact of the trend in fourth-quarter results and probably in 2018. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions - mainly Actelion – will support top-line growth. All these factors bode well for the stock.

3208,CELG,"The biotech industry has been on the comeback trail in 2017 after facing a number of challenges last year including pricing pressure, rising competition, pipeline setbacks, pricing pressure, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs.Frequent FDA approvals, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong clinical study results and continued strength in some legacy products have changed the scenario for the better this year.In fact, the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index has gained 21.1% so far this year in sharp contrast to last year’s decline of 22%.Notably, the Medical - Biomed/Genetics sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #115, which places it at the top 43% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one. Moreover, the Medical - Biomed/Genetics industry has increased 3% this year so far.The positive factors are expected to continue contributing to the sector’s growth next year. Also, on Dec 20, 2017, the Senate Republicans passed the tax overhaul Bill, excluding the provisions. The Bill permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21% which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies.Further, companies will be allowed to pay a 5% tax on reinvested earnings and 10% tax on deferred cash earnings. After the Senate passed the tax Bill, the House of Representatives re-voted 224-201 in favor of the Bill, complying with the Senate rules.The approval of the bill is an advantage for the biotech companies as the companies will be left with with more cash on hand. This cash can be utilized for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively less this year than in 2016.What has caught our attention in 2017 is that smaller biotech companies have done well and we saw a sharp rise in their share prices. These companies are continuously working on bringing innovative new treatments to market, and there could be significant catalysts in the coming quarters in the form of important new product approvals as well as major data read-outs.Here we discuss four such companies whose prices have increased more than 100% this year.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALNY  -  Free Report): Alnylam has been in the news for the past few months based on impressive progress of its pipeline candidates. The company is making fast progress toward its goal of achieving having three marketed products by the end of 2020. During the past few weeks, the company completed regulatory submissions for patisiran in the United States and Europe.The potential approval of patisiran in 2018 is likely to be a huge boost for Alnylam as it will be the first approved product for the company.Alnylam also announced that in December, the FDA lifted clinical hold placed on all ongoing studies of its hemophilia candidate, fitusiran.The continuous positive developments have led to a consistent rise in shares. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and the shares of the company have soared 228% compared with the industry’s gain of 3%.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report): Shares of the company have increased 200.4% this year so far compared with the industry’s gain of 3%. The company’s CAR-T candidate, bb2121, produced encouraging results in patients with a deadly blood cancer. The results were presented at ASH Annual Meeting held in December.The representatives from Bluebird and bb2121 co-developer Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) revealed that 94% of the patients with advanced forms of multiple myeloma exhibited positive responses to the therapy in a recent study. The two companies also reported that at least seven study participants were complete responders.If the two companies can get bb2121 on the fast track to approval, they would become the third group to bring a CAR-T treatment to market. CAR-T is an emerging method of treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. : This Washington-based biopharmaceutical company focuses on the development of immuno-oncology treatments. It carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company’s shares have gained a significant 138.8% so far this year.  Last week, the company reported additional data from a phase I study (TRANSCEND) on its lead pipeline CAR-T candidate, JCAR017, for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). The study demonstrated that the percentage of people showing an overall response rate (ORR) and  complete response (“CR”) rate at three months was more than what it had shown in the previous data presented in June.The study also showed that the safety profile of JCAR017 remained impressive with only 1% of patients experiencing severe cytokine release syndrome and 15% experiencing severe neurotoxicity.The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL by the end of 2018 with a biologics license application expected to be filed in the second half of 2018.Puma Biotechnology, Inc. (PBYI  -  Free Report): Shares of the company have skyrocketed 216.5% compared with the industry’s increase of 3% during this period. The FDA approval of Puma’s cancer drug, Nerlynx (neratinib) in the United States this year coupled with strategic collaborations have led to consistent appreciation in share price.The FDA approval of Nerlynx for breast cancer was a huge boost to Puma, given the immense commercial potential in the target market. The drug was made commercially available in the United States in August.

3209,CELG,"After a busy last week filled with clinical trial data presentation at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology, the cancer space saw regulatory approvals for label expansion of four drugs this week.Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) breast cancer drug, Perjeta, received FDA nod for its label expansion in post-surgery breast cancer with high risk of recurrence. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) blockbuster PD-1 inhibitor drug, Opdivo, received approval for intravenous administration in patients with completely resected melanoma with lymph node involvement or metastatic disease in the United States. Meanwhile, Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Bosulif has been approved for treating Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (“CML”) in first-line setting. Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) also announced the approval of Cabometyx’s label expansion in previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”).However, Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) suffered a setback when its key drug, Revlimid, failed in a phase III study evaluating it as a maintenance therapy in treatment-naïve follicular lymphoma patients.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced the acceptance of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) by the FDA that sought label expansion of Tagrisso to include first-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) whose tumors have EGFR mutations. The sNDA was also granted priority review, suggesting speedy review with a decision in the next six months.Let’s see the major news in details.Roche's Perjeta Gets Approval in Post-Surgery Breast Cancer: The FDA approved Perjeta in combination with Herceptin and chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy for HER2-positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. The drug regimen significantly reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death compared to Herceptin and chemotherapy alone. (Read more: Roche's Perjeta Gets FDA Nod for Post Surgery Breast Cancer)Also, during the week, Roche entered into an agreement to acquire U.S. based biotech company, Ignyta for $1.7 billion to boost its oncology portfolio.

3210,CELG,"Shares of Juno Therapeutics  continued to soar on Tuesday. The stock has now gained nearly 40% since the announcement that fellow CAR-T cancer therapy designer Kite Pharma  is being acquired by biotech behemoth Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report). Along with Kite and Bluebird Bio (BLUE  -  Free Report), Juno is a leader in the development of CAR-T cancer treatments—a therapy that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells. Kite is significantly further in the approval process than Juno and Bluebird, and its lead candidate, axicabtagene ciloleucel, is currently under review by the FDA. Axicabtagene ciloleucel is expected to be approved as a treatment for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with a decision coming on or before November 29. On Monday, Gilead announced that it was acquiring Kite for $11.9 billion in an all-cash deal. The buyout valued Kite at $180 per share, a 29% premium to the company’s closing price on Friday (also read: Why Did Kite Pharma Stock Skyrocket Today?).  “The acquisition of Kite establishes Gilead as a leader in cellular therapy and provides a foundation from which to drive continued innovation for people with advanced cancers,” Gilead President and CEO John F. Milligan said in a statement. Of course, the acquisition immediately inspired speculation that Juno and Bluebird would also become takeover targets. With a market cap of just $3.8 billion, Juno would be the cheapest of the three CAR-T leaders; however, the company recently took a step back in the approval process. In March, Juno announced that it was discontinuing development of its lead CAR-T candidate, which had already reached Phase 2 development.  Bluebird’s CAR-T program, bb2121, is still in Phase 1, but the drug has pretty encouraging data so far. Bluebird’s market cap currently sits at about $4.9 billion. Interestingly, both Juno and Bluebird have partnerships with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report), another global biopharma giant. However, Bluebird’s partnership only extends to its bb2121 project, so it could a more diversified buyout candidate—especially considering that the company has another gene therapy program targeting beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Nevertheless, Juno might emerge as the lowest-priced CAR-T pure play right now. Want to know more about Kite?

3211,CELG,"With earnings season drawing to a close, focus is back on pipeline and regulatory updates. While Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), which has several pipeline catalysts lined up for the second half of the year, reported data on one of its late-stage pipeline candidates, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) got priority review for its investigational HIV treatment.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesRegeneron Shelves RSV Antibody on Study Failure: Regeneron’s investigational antibody, suptavumab (REGN2222), for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study conducted in infants. Regeneron has decided that it will not continue with the development of this candidate. Regeneron has several pipeline catalysts lined up for the second half of the year. Later this quarter, the company expects to report top-line phase III data on Dupixent for asthma – positive data would allow the company to go ahead with a U.S. filing in the fourth quarter. Another important data readout scheduled for the second half of the year is on the company’s PD-1 antibody REGN2810, for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the second most common skin cancer after basal cell carcinoma and the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Meanwhile, Eylea is being evaluated in combination with nesvacumab with top-line data from two phase II studies (wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema) expected in the fourth quarter of the year.Regeneron is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Priority Review for Gilead HIV Drug: Gilead gained priority review in the U.S. for its investigational, fixed-dose combination of bictegravir (50mg) (BIC), a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (200/25mg) (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone, for the treatment of HIV. Gilead had used a Priority Review voucher at the time of filing the regulatory application. With the combination gaining priority review, a response from the FDA should be out by Feb 12, 2018. The combination is under review in the EU as well. Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera bringing in sales of $6.2 billion in the first half of 2017. Gilead’s shares are up 2.1% year to date, lagging the industry’s 7.4% rally (Also read: Gilead NDA for HIV Combo Regimen Gets Priority Review).Another Late-Stage Failure for Ophthotech Eye Drug: Ophthotech (OPHT  -  Free Report), which is focused on the development of treatments for eye diseases, announced that Fovista failed to meet the primary endpoint in another late-stage study. The superiority study was evaluating Fovista anti-PDGF therapy in combination with Eylea (aflibercept) or Avastin (bevacizumab) anti-VEGF therapy compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The study failed to achieve the primary endpoint. The company had anyway attributed a low likelihood of success to the study given Fovista's earlier failure in two phase III studies as well as the failure of a mid-stage study conducted by a competitor on a PDGF inhibitor and a VEGF inhibitor combination for AMD.Ionis Retains Full Rights to Inotersen and IONIS-FB-LRx: Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS  -  Free Report) said that Glaxo has declined its options for two drugs, inotersen and IONIS-FB-LRx, in keeping with its decision to reprioritize its pipeline and review its Rare Diseases business. The company, however, will continue to collaborate with Ionis for IONIS-HBVRx and IONIS-HBV-LRx, which are being evaluated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.With Ionis retaining rights to these two investigational drugs, the company laid out its plans and said that it will be filing for approval of inotersen in 2017 followed by launch in 2018. The initial indication for inotersen, which has been designed to treat patients with TTR amyloidosis (ATTR), is expected to be for the treatment of patients with polyneuropathy due to hereditary TTR amyloidosis (hATTR-PN).Ionis said that it is considering setting up a commercial subsidiary to commercialize or co-commercialize inotersen in North America. The company is evaluating other options as well including a partnership deal.Meanwhile, IONIS-FB-LRx is slated to move into a mid-stage study in patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) later this year (Also read: Ionis Pharmaceuticals Retains Rights to Inotersen, Stock Up).Galapagos Up on IPF Data: Galapagos NV’s (GLPG  -  Free Report) shares were up 10.8% on positive data from a mid-stage study on the company’s investigational idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) drug. GLPG1690 halted disease progression in IPF patients in the study and is the first autotaxin inhibitor to show effect in an IPF study. Galapagos now intends to move the candidate into a late-stage study and is already in discussions with regulators regarding the study design.Galapagos’s data comes shortly after FibroGen’s investigational IPF drug, pamrevlumab, fared well in a mid-stage study as well as two combination safety sub-studies. Pamrevlumab is an anti-connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) antibody.The IPF market represents huge commercial potential – IPF or abnormal scarring of the lungs is a rare and serious lung disease with survival rates comparable to those of some of the deadliest cancers. Currently approved IPF drugs include Esbriet and Ofev.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NASDAQ Biotechnology Index declined 1.6% over the last five trading sessions.

3212,CELG,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) posted second-quarter 2017 loss of $1.78 per share, wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.52 and the year-ago loss of $1.47.Agios’ shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The company’s shares have surged 43.3% compared with the industry’s increase of 18%.Earlier this month, the FDA has granted an approval to its lead candidate, Idhifa, (enasidenib) for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, apart from Idhifa, Agios does not have any sanctioned product in its portfolio yet. Hence, the company’s top line mainly comprises collaboration revenues and milestone payments.Total collaboration revenue in the second quarter amounted to $11.3 million, which marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12 million. However, revenues substantially surged 61.4% from the year-ago figure of $7 million. This swell in revenues is partially attributable to reimbursement from Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) for Idhifa commercialization efforts in the U.S.Research & development expenses jumped almost 57% year over year to $79.8 million. The increase was largely driven by increased costs associated with the ivosidenib program.General and administrative expenses climbed 28% year over year to $16.1 million due to a higher headcount and other professional costs to support the expansion of operations.Pipeline UpdatesAgios has several candidates in its pipeline, including an IDH1 mutant inhibitor, ivosidenib (AG-120) and pan-IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881.In June, Agios presented positive data from the dose-escalation and expansion cohorts of the phase I study, evaluating single agent ivosidenib in mutant-positive cholangiocarcinoma at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.During the second quarter, Agios initiated a phase III study to evaluate ivosidenib in front-line AML patients with an IDH1 mutant-positive advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Subsequently, in April, the FDA granted an orphan drug designation to ivosidenib for treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. The company plans to submit an NDA to the FDA for ivosidenib by this year-end.Additionally, Agios is conducting phase I studies on another pipeline candidate, AG-881, for treatment of patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors, including glioma. The company completed enrollment for the study during the quarter.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3213,CELG,"The third-quarter reporting cycle is witnessing revenue acceleration and a positive revisions trend for Q4.Results from about half of the S&P 500 members are already out. As of Oct 27, 2017, total earnings for the 272 S&P 500 members are up 8.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% and 66.2% surpassing the earnings and revenue estimates, respectively.According to the Earnings Preview, these 272 S&P 500 companies account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization. Per the report, total earnings of the S&P 500 companies in Q3 are expected to grow 5.4% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Please note that the broader Medical sector (includes drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 5.2% in earnings in Q3.Among the biotech/pharma bigwigs, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) reported their third-quarter results last week.  While Merck, Celgene and AbbVie outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings, they lagged the same for revenues. However, Bristol-Myers and Gilead surpassed expectations for both earnings and revenues.Notably, Bristol-Myers and Gilead raised their earnings outlook for 2017 as well. While Merck raised its previously issued adjusted earnings guidance, it upped sales guidance marginally. Abbvie and Celgene also tightened their earnings guidance for 2017.Here we have three biotech/pharma companies that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 31.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) Pfizer, which is scheduled to release earnings before the market opens, delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.08% in the last quarter. The company’s earnings performance has been mixed with the bottom line missing in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average surprise to negative 0.39%.For this quarter, Pfizer has an Earnings ESP of -0.11% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 65 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) may contribute to the top line, meaningfully. Meanwhile, sales of blockbuster drug Enbrel will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The lower sales trend in Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to continue as well. Sales of Viagra are expected to be affected by lower demand.

3214,CELG,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Nov 1, before the opening bell.Shares have surged 57.9% so far this year, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 22.7%.Agios’ earnings track record shows mixed results with the company having missed estimates twice in the trailing four quarters and also surpassed the same twice. Overall, Agios has an average positive surprise of 0.34%. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative surprise of 17.11%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayAgios’ only marketed drug is Idhifa (enasidenib) for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation.Idhifa received the FDA approval earlier in August and was launched soon after.The company expects to draw revenues for the first time from Idhifa this to-be-reported quarter after the drug’s FDA approval. We expect management to update on commercialization/launch plans of Idhifa at the third-quarter conference call. Investors’ focus will also be on Agios’ pipeline over there. Its cancer pipeline includes AG-120 (IDH1 mutant inhibitor) and AG-881 (pan-IDH mutant inhibitor).A phase III study on AG-120 is currently on for front-line AML patients with an IDH1 mutation. The company plans for an NDA submission in the United States by this year-end. On the other hand, Agios is conducting phase I studies on AG-881 for treating patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors, including glioma. The FDA granted a fast track designation to the candidate for the given indication.Notably, Agios is busy developing AG-881 in collaboration with Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report), which should fetch in collaboration revenues.Earlier in August, the company completed an agreement with global regulators to advance its lead candidate AG-348, in its rare genetic metabolic disorders (RGD) portfolio into two pivotal trials for treatment of patients with Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. The studies are expected to start in the first half of 2018.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Agios is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Agios has an Earnings ESP of -2.06% that represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of $1.78 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.74. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Agios has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this leaves the case inconclusive.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks worth considering as these consist of the right combination of elements to surpass expectations this quarter:Emergent Biosolutions, Inc. (EBS  -  Free Report), which is scheduled to release results on Nov 2, has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and also carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

3215,CELG,"Prothena Corporation plc (PRTA  -  Free Report) reported a loss of $1.26 per share for the first quarter of 2018, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.23 and the year-ago loss of $0.99.Quarterly revenues came in at $0.23 million, down from $0.26 million in the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $31.45 million.Prothena’s stock was trading down in after-market trading following the announcement of the results. The company’s shares have lost 74.8% in last six months, worse than the industry’s decline of 10.8%.  Quarter in DetailR&D expenses were $34.7 million, up 35% year over year primarily due to due to higher consulting expenses, higher personnel costs, higher expense associated with PRX002/RG7935 and higher clinical trial costs.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $14.2 million, up 31.4% year over year.Pipeline UpdatesProthena has discontinued the development of its lead pipeline candidate, NEOD001. The candidate, an antibody, was being evaluated for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. A phase IIb study, PRONTO, did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Hence, the company asked the independent data monitoring committee (“DMC”) of the phase III VITAL study to review a futility analysis of the ongoing VITAL study. Thereafter, the DMC recommended discontinuation of the VITAL study.Hence, the company decided to discontinue all studies for the development of NEOD001, including the VITAL study as well as the open label extension studies.On the other hand, Prothena is evaluating PRX002, in collaboration with Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies. The company initiated a phase II study, PASADENA, on PRX002 in patients suffering from Parkinson`s disease, which triggered a $30-million milestone payment from Roche to Prothena. The study is continuing enrolment.Alongside, Prothena is also working to advance PRX004 in a phase I study in patients with ATTR amyloidosis. A phase I study was initiated in the second quarter of 2018 and continues to enroll patients. Preliminary data is expected in 2019.Prothena also entered into a global neuroscience research & development collaboration with Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report)  to develop new therapies for a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases. The collaboration is focused on three targets implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, inducing tau, TDP-43 and a third that is undisclosed. Per the terms, Prothena received a $100 million upfront payment and a $50 million equity investment by Celgene. The company is eligible to receive future potential exercise payments and milestone payments for each licensed program. Prothena is also eligible to receive additional royalties on net sales of any resulting marketed products.Our TakeThe wider-than-expected loss in the first quarter was disappointing. The discontinuation of the development of NEOD001 came as a major blow to the investors as the company has a very limited number of candidates in its pipeline and NEOD001 was a lead candidate. Prothena Corporation plc Price and Consensus  Prothena Corporation plc Price and Consensus | Prothena Corporation plc Quote Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderProthena carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Exelixis’ earnings per share estimates increased from 59 cents to 86 cents for 2018 over the last seven days after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter results.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

3216,CELG,"Problems do not seem to end for biotech bigwig Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report). The company’s president and chief operating officer, Scott A. Smith, has decided to step down from his position with immediate effect.As a result, chairman and CEO Mark J. Alles will take up responsibilities.The sudden exit of the president has added to the woes as Smith was primarily responsible for building the Inflammation and Immunology franchise, and particularly for the launch of Otezla.Celgene stated that the company is reshuffling its executive team to enhance leadership focus.The news comes at a time when Celgene is sailing in troubled waters. Celgene’s stock has lost 18.3% in the last three months, worse than the industry’s decline of 7.6%. Shares lost 2.4% on the news.  Last month, Celgene suffered yet another setback when it received Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for multiple sclerosis candidate ozanimod. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (“MS”). The FDA stated that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were inadequate to allow a complete review. Hence, Celgene will request a Type A meeting with the FDA to ascertain the additional information needed for resubmission of the NDA. The news comes as a great disappointment for investors given the potential the MS market holds.Notably, things have been on the downturn for the company since last October after Celgene announced a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) have been discontinued following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis.In December 2017, a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan failed. Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. While Revlimid sales continue to be impressive, we are concerned about the company’s dependence on the product for growth. The drug is set to lose patent exclusivity soon and hence Celgene is desperately trying to revive its portfolio.The company recently announced a development and co-promotion agreement with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report). Both companies have entered into a deal to co-develop and co-promote bb2121, an experimental anti-B-cell maturation antigen chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in the United States.Earlier in 2018, Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics and added JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to its lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T candidate, currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Zacks Rank & Key PickCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Regeneron’s earnings per share estimates have moved up from $18.65 to $18.68 for 2018 in the last 30 days.

3217,CELG,"Shares of Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) moved up 3% after the company announced a development and co-promotion agreement with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report). Both companies have entered into a deal to co-develop and co-promote bb2121, an experimental anti-B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in the United States.We remind investors that both companies entered into a broad, global strategic research collaboration in 2013 to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies in oncology. Currently, bluebird bio and Celgene are collaborating to develop CAR-T cell therapies targeting BCMA and the lead target of this program is bb2121 which is being evaluated for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.Celgene is upbeat on the potential of the bb2121 and believes that the candidate can revolutionize the treatment approach and outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma.Per the terms of the latest agreement, both companies will share the costs and profits in the United States equally. bluebird and Celgene have joint responsibility for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of bb2121 in the United States. In addition, Celgene will assume sole responsibility for drug product manufacturing and commercialization outside the United States.In addition, bluebird will also receive milestones and royalties on ex-U.S. sales.Meanwhile, bluebird bio and Celgene are also working together on a second clinical-stage anti-BCMA CAR-T program, bb21217.Our TakeThe news should somewhat relieve the wary investors as Celgene’s stock has lost 15.3% in the last three months, worse than the industry’s decline of 5.2%.  Celgene is making desperate attempts to revive its portfolio/pipeline after a series of pipeline setbacks in recent times.Things have been on the downturn for the company since last October after Celgene announced a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) have been discontinued following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis. In December 2017, a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan failed. Celgene suffered yet another setback when it received Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application for multiple sclerosis candidate ozanimod.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017. The company recently acquired Juno Therapeutics and added JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to Celgene’s lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T candidate, currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  The candidate is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the United States in 2019 and generate sales of approximately $3 billion.  Hence, the bluebird deal will further bolster Celgene’s presence in the CAR-T space.Zacks Rank & Key PickCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3218,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is taking desperate attempts to bolster its portfolio and reduce dependence on lead drug, Revlimid.  However, things do not seem to be working in favor of the company.  Celgene’s stock has lost 17.8% in the last three months, worse than the industry’s decline of 5.6%.Last month, Celgene suffered yet another setback when it received Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for multiple sclerosis candidate ozanimod. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (“MS”). The FDA stated that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were inadequate to allow a complete review.

The study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared with the standard of care featuring Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-VN CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance for previously untreated follicular lymphoma. However, the R2 treatment arm could not achieve superiority in the co-primary endpoints of complete response or unconfirmed complete response CR/CRu) at 120 weeks and in terms of progression-free survival observed during the pre-planned analysis.Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. While Revlimid sales continue to be impressive, we are concerned about the company’s dependence on the product for growth. The drug is set to lose patent exclusivity soon and hence Celgene is desperately trying to revive its portfolio.Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017 just like Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) which acquired Kite Pharma.  The Juno acquisition added JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to Celgene’s lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T candidate, currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  The candidate is expected to obtain regulatory approval in the United States in 2019 and generate sales of approximately $3 billion.  While the acquisition of Juno will surely boost Celgene’s growth prospects given the immense potential in the CAR-T therapy space, it might be a risky proposition for Celgene as Juno has faced setbacks with its pipeline candidate, JCAR015.Hence, we expect investors to stay on the side-lines for the time being and observe how the revival story for Celgene plays out.Zacks Rank & Key PickCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Regeneron’s earnings per share estimates have moved up from $18.65 to $18.68 for 2018 in the last 30 days.

3219,CELG,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.99%.The pharma giant has a mixed record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters while missing in the other two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 0.35%.Pfizer’s shares rose 1.9% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 11.8% for the Zacks classified industry.Factors at PlayNew products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are likely to contribute to the top line meaningfully. Xeljanz (5 mg taken twice daily) was approved in the EU in Mar 2017, which may boost the drug’s sales in the to-be reported quarter.Also, revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the Sep 2016 Medivation acquisition, are likely to propel U.S. revenues.The Hospira acquisition is expected to be an important growth driver as well.Also, Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Remicade in Nov 2016. Inflectra recorded sales of $17 million in the U.S. and $78 million globally in the first quarter. The biosimilar may generate more sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, Pfizer will continue to face headwinds in the form of loss of exclusivity on key products like Pristiq, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements, which will continue to hamper top-line growth. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is expected to continue to see lower sales while lower demand should continue to hurt sales of Viagra.Meanwhile, the bottom line should be driven by cost savings and share buybacks. However, new product launch expenses and R&D investments are expected to hurt profits.On the second-quarter call, investor focus is expected to remain on the performance of new products and pipeline progress including biosimilars and immuno-oncology. Importantly, key cancer candidate, Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Mar 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. The drug may bring in some revenues in the second quarter. Management is expected to shed light on how the launch is progressing at the conference call.Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) candidate, Besponsa, was also approved in the EU in late Jun 2017. We expect management to comment on the commercialization plans at the conference call.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (66 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (65 cents per share), is +1.54%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that also have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Aug 9, has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and a Zacks Rank #3.

3220,CELG,"We issued an updated research report on Corcept Therapeutics Inc. (CORT  -  Free Report) on Jul 12.Corcept’s shares have surged 71.2% year to date, comparing favorably with the Zacks classified Medical-Drugs industry’s gain of 6.3%.Currently, the company is striving to commercialize Korlym (mifepristone) successfully by deploying medical liaisons and sales representatives. In fact, Korlym  is its only marketed drug, which is approved for the treatment of patients with Cushing's syndrome.Notably, about 10–15 of every 1 million people are newly diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome each year, resulting into more than 3,000 new patients annually in the U.S. Therefore, we believe increased awareness among physicians and patients about the drug and expanded sales efforts should boost sales, going forward.Corcept is currently working on developing the drug for additional indications. It is conducting a phase I/II safety and efficacy study on Korlym in combination with Eisai Co., Ltd.’s anti-cancer drug, Halaven, for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Enrolment in the study is complete and the company announced encouraging data in Dec 2016.We expect a successful label expansion of Korlym to boost the top line significantly, as the disease represents huge potential with as many as 40,000 women in the U.S. being diagnosed every year.Moreover, the University of Chicago is conducting a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xtandi, for the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. The institution also plans to conduct a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Abraxane, for the treatment of patients with TNBC.Importantly, apart from Korlym, Corcept is also evaluating CORT125134 for Cushing’s syndrome and a range of solid tumors. Early data on the candidate for Cushing’s syndrome has been quite promising. The company has begun dosing patients in a phase I/II study on CORT125134, in combination with Abraxane, for the treatment of a range of solid-tumor cancers. The possible target indications include triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and sarcoma. The company expects open expansion cohorts by the end of 2017.Additionally, the company has three promising preclinical candidates - CORT118335 (metabolic disorders), CORT122928 (alcohol withdrawal) and CORT125281 (castration-resistant prostate cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and ovarian cancer) – which are expected to enter the clinic in 2017.Also, during its first quarter 2017 earnings release, the company raised its 2017 revenue guidance. Now, Corcept projects revenues to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million more than its prior expectation of $120 million to $130 million.Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated Price and Consensus Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated Price and Consensus | Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCorcept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3221,CELG,"Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. (ADVM  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results, possibly on May 8.The company has a dismal track record as it missed estimates in two of the last four quarters, resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 4.98%. In the last reported quarter, Adverum beat estimates, delivering a positive surprise of 5.88%.However, Adverum’s shares have rallied 78.6% year to date, significantly outperforming a 10.7% decline registered by the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAdverum is a clinical-stage gene therapy company company with no approved product in its portfolio.We expect investor focus to remain on pipeline updates during the first-quarter earnings call.Adverum’s pipeline consists of gene therapy programs for rare diseases, alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, wet age-related macular degeneration (“wAMD”) and hereditary angioedema (“HAE”).Adverum initiated a phase I/II study on ADVM-043 for the treatment of A1AT deficiency in December 2017. The company expects to report preliminary data in the second half of 2018.Based on positive pre-clinical development results, the company is planning to advance its anti-VEGF gene therapy candidate, ADVM-022, to clinical stage. The candidate is being developed for treating wet AMD. Adverum is planning to file an investigational new drug (“IND”) with the FDA in the second half of 2018. The company is also developing ADVM-053 in pre-clinical study to treat HAE and is preparing to file an IND in the second half of 2018.Adverum extended its collaboration agreement with Editas Medicine, through the third quarter of 2018, in January 2018. The companies will develop treatment for up to five inherited retinal diseases using the latter’s CRISPR-based genome editing technologies.The company has also collaborated with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) to develop eight distinct ocular therapeutic targets, including AVA-311, which is being developed for treating juvenile X-Linked Retinoschisis.Why a Likley Positive Surprise ? Our proven model shows that Adverum is likely to beat estimates this quarter as it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold)  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +6.90%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of 29 cents and the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at a loss of 27 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Adverum currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc.

3222,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before the opening bell.Celgene has an excellent track record with the company beating earnings estimates in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3%.  In the last reported quarter, the company topped estimates by 2.56%. Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation Quote Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Celgene is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.63%.

The combination of Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Revlimid to Drive GrowthCelgene’s key growth driver, Revlimid, continues to drive revenues at the company. Revlimid is approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Market share gains in key markets and longer treatment duration are contributing to the drug’s growth.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on expanding Revlimid’s label further. Revlimid received FDA approval for use as a maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after they receive an autologous stem-cell transplant. The drug was also approved in the EU for the same. NDMM market share continues to grow outside of the United States with a positive uptake both in the EU and in Japan.  The company is working further on the label expansion of the drug.Continued momentum in the core indication, label expansion and global launches should help the product to keep contributing to the top line. However, in December 2017, a late stage study on Revlimid in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan failed.Revlimid sales are projected around $9.4 billion for 2018. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Revlimid currently stands at $2.2 billion for the first quarter.Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.9 billion. The drug’s label was recently updated in the United States and the EU to include data from a pooled pharmacokinetics analysis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM and impaired renal function.  Pomalyst, in combination with Darzalex and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma was recently approved by the FDA and should propel sales further. These should act as growth drivers leading to share and duration gains in the future.Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. Otezla sales are now projected at $1.5 billion.During first-quarter earnings call investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on recent acquisitions and pipeline.Earlier in 2018, Celgene acquired Juno Therapeutics and added JCAR017 (lisocabtagene maraleucel; liso-cel) to its lymphoma pipeline. JCAR017 is a best-in-class CD19-directed CAR-T candidate, currently in a pivotal program for relapsed and/or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.During the quarter, Celgene suffered a setback when it received Refusal to File letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for multiple sclerosis candidate ozanimod. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (“MS”). The FDA stated that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were inadequate to allow a complete review. Hence, Celgene will request a Type A meeting with the FDA to ascertain the additional information needed for resubmission of the NDA.Revlimid is set to lose patent exclusivity soon and hence Celgene is desperately trying to revive its portfolio.Celgene also announced a development and co-promotion agreement with bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report). Both companies have entered into a deal to co-develop and co-promote bb2121, an experimental anti-B-cell maturation antigen chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in the United States.Hence, we expect the management to throw further light on its plans going forward.Celgene’s stock has gained 16.8% in the year so far compared to the industry’s decline of 10.7%.  Stock to ConsiderHere is one stock in the healthcare sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this quarter.Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc.

3223,CELG,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 8.4% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CELG due for a breakout?

Revenues were boosted by consistent performance of the company’s key growth driver, Revlimid.Revlimid – A Key CatalystNet product sales increased 17% year over year to $3.48 billion. Net sales of Revlimid came in at $2.2 billion, reflecting 21% year-over-year growth. The drug performed well in the United States (up 24%).

3224,CELG,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) has proposed to buy Viralytics Limited, an Australian pharmaceutical company that develops oncolytic immunotherapies for a range of cancers, for $394 million (502 million Australian dollars).We believe the deal makes strategic sense and strengthens Merck’s presence in the fast growing immuno-oncology market. Immuno-oncology or immunotherapy is a new class of cancer therapy that utilizes certain parts of the immune system to fight the disease. This can be done by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells or by introducing immune system components into the body.  Immuno-oncology drugs and their combinations are in great demandWith the deal, Merck will gain Viralytics’s lead pipeline candidate Cavatak, an oncolytic virus, which engages the innate immune system to attack and kill cancer cells.Cavatak is being evaluated in several phase I/II cancer studies including a combination study with Merck’s PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda. The Cavatak/Keytruda combination is being studied in melanoma, prostate, lung and bladder cancers, per a deal signed by the companies in November 2015.Early clinical data on Cavatak demonstrated robust potential in a wide variety of tumor types, both as a monotherapy or in combination studies.In the past year, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have declined 16.4% in the period against an 11.6% increase for the industry.Merck has offered to pay 1.75 Australian dollars for each share of the Sydney-based company, which represents a premium of 160% to Viralytics average stock price over the past month. Merck will acquire Viralytics through a subsidiary. The transaction is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2018, contingent on Viralytics shareholder approval.Importantly, Cavatak complements Merck’s pipeline efforts for Keytruda, its second largest drug.Keytruda is already marketed for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer. It is also being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 studies, including more than 400 combination studies.The latest offer by Merck is one of the many mergers and acquisitions expected this year now that the tax reforms are in place. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is expected to spur merger activity this year.Biotech/pharma M&A activity has started to gain steam with Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) announcing two deals each.Sanofi, earlier this year, announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company, Ablynx and haemophilia focused biotech, Bioverativ. Celgene also announced deals to buy Juno Therapeutics, Inc. , which focuses on the development of CAR-T therapies and Impact Biomedicines, which will add a late-stage JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3225,CELG,"Juno Therapeutics Inc.  is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 7, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.98%.Juno’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has skyrocketed 267.9% compared with the industry’s 2.5% decline. The company’s poor earnings history shows negative surprises in three of the last four quarters with a positive one just once. The average negative earnings surprise for the trailing four quarters is 1.12%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLast month, Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced that it will acquire its partner Juno for $87 per share in cash or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. Notably, the former already owns approximately 9.7% of the latter's outstanding shares. The transaction is expected to close during first-quarter 2018. We expect investors to approach management with queries on this merger.With no approved products in its portfolio, Juno is yet to generate product revenues. Thus, investors’ focus will primarily be on the company’s cash burn and its pipeline updates in the to-be-reported quarter.Juno’s most advanced pipeline candidates include JCAR017 and JCAR014, which use CAR T-cell technology to target CD19 (Cluster of Differentiation 19).JCAR017 is in a phase I study for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and a phase I/II trial on pediatric and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). In December 2017, the company reported positive results from the phase I program, demonstrating improved overall and complete responses in the core group. The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL as early as 2018 and for multiple indications by the end of 2019.We remind investors that last year, Novartis’ CAR T Kymriah and Gilead’s Yescarta received the FDA approvals in August and October for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively. Hence on fourth-quarter conference call, we expect investors to focus on updates from the company’s plans to introduce JCAR017 into the market space. The candidate JCAR017 has already induced competition due to the above-mentioned approvals.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Juno is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Juno has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $1.15. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Juno carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. Notably, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Moreover, a company’s 0.00% ESP  makes surprise prediction difficult.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Quote Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of health care stocks with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Exelixis, Inc.

3226,CELG,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) has unanimously (10-0) recommended the approval of immunocellular therapy candidate CTL019 (tisagenlecleucel).CTL019, an investigational chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, is being evaluated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).We remind investors that CTL019 was first developed by the University of Pennsylvania. Novartis entered into a collaboration agreement in 2012 with Penn to further research, develop and commercialize CAR-T cell therapies, including CTL019, for the treatment of cancers.CAR-T is manufactured for each individual patient using their own cells thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment process, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create T cells that are genetically coded to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other Bcells expressing a specific antigen.Earlier in 2017, Novartis submitted its Biologics License Application (BLA) for CTL019 to the FDA, marking the first submission by Novartis for a CAR-T cell therapy.We remind investors that CTL019 previously received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation. The application is under Priority Review in the U.S. While the FDA will consider the ODAC vote as it reviews the BLA, it is not obligated to follow the recommendation. A decision is expected by Oct 2017.The recommendation was based on review of CTL019 r/r B-cell ALL development program, including the pivotal phase II global trial, ELIANA, the first pediatric global CAR-T cell therapy registration trial.CTL019 could become the first CAR-T cell therapy if approved. A potential approval will also open new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL.Meanwhile, Novartis plans to make additional filings for CTL019 in the EU later this year, including applications with the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of adults with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Novartis has outperformed the Zacks classified industry in the last six months. The stock has rallied 13.0% compared with the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s 11.3% gain.Going forward, we expect that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones will bode well for Novartis. Also, strong performance of growth products should be able to offset the impact of generic competition for Gleevec.The news bode well for other companies who are developing CAR-T cell therapies like Kite Pharma Inc. . The company submitted its BLA to the FDA in Mar2017 for the approval of lead candidate KTE-C19. KTE-C19 is a CAR-based therapy, being evaluated for the treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and DLBCL. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of Nov 29.Meanwhile, bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) and Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) also entered into a collaboration to develop CAR-T cell therapies for cancer. The collaboration was amended and restated to focus on developing product candidates targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA).Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3227,CELG,"The pharma/biotech sector has picked up this year after being battered by the drug pricing controversy in 2016. The first half has been pretty strong for companies in the space.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has risen almost 9.8% year to date (YTD) after declining almost 10% last year. NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up 17.7% YTD after sliding 19.1% in 2016.The sector does have its share of challenges in the form of rising competition, high profile pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and the loss of exclusivity for certain key drugs. Though the drug pricing issue still prevails, investors, lately, are hoping that steep pricing will not be as damaging as feared previously.Nonetheless, strong performance of newer drugs, evolving pipelines, impressive clinical trial results, new drug approvals, continued strong performance of legacy products and rising demand are some of the factors that promise a sustained recovery in the sector.Meanwhile, there have been many more FDA drug approvals so far this year than in 2016.  A total of 23 drugs have gained FDA approval YTD, beating the total of 22 for the whole of 2016. With acceleration in the drug approval process, more innovation and a surge in new drug approvals are expected.Though M&A activities and collaborations/deals have slowed down this year, chances are that they will pick up in the second half. With President Trump promising a major tax reform that will allow companies to bring back cash held overseas, acquisition activities are expected to pick up pace. Then again, the number of deals will still be less than the pharma industry, as it has been for many years.Finally, the Republican administration’s vow to ""repeal and replace"" Obamacare bodes well for the sector’s growth.How to Pick Likely Q2 WinnersGiven the enormity of the healthcare space, selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be quite daunting. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.  More often than not, a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company leads to stock price appreciation.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their upcoming earnings announcement.

3228,CELG,"U.S. stock markets ended in negative territory on Monday as a broad-based decline pushed all three major indexes in red. Slide into the healthcare and industrial stocks more than offset gains from several merger and acquisitions (M&A) except a telecom mega deal. Moreover, strong first quarter earnings results also failed to uplift investor’s sentiment.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,163.15, declining 0.6% or 148.04 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.8% to close at 2,648.05. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,066.27, decreasing 0.8%. A total of 6.81 billion shares were traded on in the first trading day of the week, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.57 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.74 -to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.99 to -1 ratio. The CBOE VIX increased 3.4% and closed at 15.93.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow decreased 0.6% with 25 stocks of the 30-stock blue-chip index closing in the red while five traded in the green.The S&P 500 decreased 0.8% led by 1.5% decline of the Health care Select Sector SPDR (XLV), 1.3% decrease of Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) and Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB). Each of the 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. The index recorded 22 new 52-week highs and 11 new 52-week lows.The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8%.  The index recorded 55 new 52-week highs and 46 new 52-week lows.Healthcare, Metal and Industrial Stocks Pull Down the MarketHealthcare, metal and industrials sectors were the worst performers in the last day of trading in April. These three sectors led a broad-based market decline.Shares of Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) declined 4.5% after a Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) report stated that the company will require one-to-three years more to resubmit its applications for the U.S. approval of the company’s critical drug ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis.Shares of Allergen plc (AGN  -  Free Report) plunged 5.2% after its Chairman and CEO Brent Saunders expressed his view’s that he is opposed to any changes of the company’s fundamental business structure. (Read More)  However, Allergen’s first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $3.74 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.36. Revenues generated $3.67 billion, which marginally exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.59 billion.Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report) declined a massive 20.6% after reducing its 2018 outlook. The company’s adjusted earnings came in at $0.34 per share for the first quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.32. Revenues of $3,445 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,329.6 million.However, Arconic now expects adjusted earnings in 2018 to be in the range of $1.17-$1.27 per share (down from prior guidance of $1.45-$1.55) and free cash flow to be around $250 million (down from $500 million).

Net earnings came in at $0.09 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.03. Revenues generated $1,659 million exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,549 million. Investors were expecting more especially after President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel.Concern on Telecom Mega Deal Overshadows Slew of M&AsA number of M&As announcements helped markets advance in the initial hours of trading. Shares of Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) increased 1.3% after the retail giant’s U.K. arm, ASDA Group Ltd., agreed to merge with British supermarket chain J Sainsbury plc. Likewise, shares of ILG Inc. (ILG  -  Free Report) rose 4.5% after Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corp. (VAC  -  Free Report) agreed to buy the former.Also, shares of logistics company DCT Industrial Trust Inc. DCT advanced 11.6% after Prologis Inc. (PLD) agrees to buy the former. Likewise, shares of Andeavor (ANDV) advanced 13% after Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MRO) agreed to buy the former.However, investor concerns regarding the approval of a $26.5 billion merger deal between T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS and Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) overshadowed investor’s positive enthusiasm over these M&As.Share price of T-Mobile US and Sprint declined 6.2% and 13.7%, respectively as many industry watchers believe that the FCC may not okay the deal. Even if the deal is permitted, it will be detrimental to consumers since number of national wireless operators will come down to three from four.Economic Data The Department of Commerce reported that personal consumption expenditure (PCE) grew $67.1 billion or 0.4% in March, the first advance since the end of 2017. Personal income increased $47.8 billion or 0.3% and personal disposable income increased $39.8 billion or 0.3% in March.PCE price index, a key inflation barometer used by the Fed, rose to 12-month rate of 2% from 1.7% in February, hitting the central bank’s target for the first time in a year. The core PCE — excluding food and energy — increased 1.9% in March.Monthly RoundupFor the month of April, all three major stock market indexes witnessed marginal gains reversing the overall negative trend witnessed in the last two straight months. The Dow and S&P 500 each increased by 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.1%. Year to date, Nasdaq Composite is trading in the green while both Dow 30 and S&P 500 are in red.Strong earnings results by most of the large U.S. corporates failed to enthuse investors. Disappointing guidance by Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, the largest contract chipmaker worldwide, led to losses for tech majors, especially Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Moreover, Caterpillar Inc.’s (CAT  -  Free Report) forecast that economic growth might decelerate later this year also resulted in a broad-based market decline.  Rising bond yields also dented investors’ confidence. In April, the 10-year Treasury yield briefly hit the psychological 3% mark for the first time since January 2014.Additionally, stock markets fluctuate due to the fear about a global trade war and geopolitical tensions related to Syria.Stocks That Made HaedlinesBP Posts Strong Q1 Earnings on Record Upstream BusinessBP plc (BP  -  Free Report) reported strong first-quarter 2018 results as oil price has started to recover from the slump witnessed nearly four years back.

3229,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announced data from phase III trial, RELIEF, on dermatology drug Otezla in a late-breaking oral presentation at the 2018 American Academy of Dermatology (""AAD"") Annual Meeting.The phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, RELIEF, is evaluating Otezla twice daily (“BID”) in 207 patients with active Behçet’s Disease who were previously treated with at least one topical or systemic medication.The primary endpoint was the area under the curve (“AUC”) for a number of oral ulcers at week 12, while the secondary objectives of the study included changes from baseline in pain of oral ulcers, Behçet’s Syndrome Activity Score, Behçet’s Disease Current Activity Index and Behçet’s Disease quality of life score at week 12.Data from the study showed statistically significant reductions in oral ulcers with Otezla versus placebo through week 12.Consequently, Celgene plans to submit supplemental New Drug Applications for Otezla BID for the treatment of active Behçet’s Disease with oral ulcers in the United States and Japan in the second half of this year. The company also plans to submit a type II Variation to the Marketing Authorization Application in EU in 2019.Otezla is already approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy in the United States and for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis.Sales of Otezla have increased in the fourth quarter after a slowdown in the third.  Celgene’s stock has tumbled 25.3% in the last six months compared with the industry’s slip of 0.6%.Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Rituxan failed. The stock was hit earlier after a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) was discontinued.The threat of generic competition is also looming large on Revlimid forcing Celgene to look for acquisitions. In January 2018, Celgene announced plans to acquire Juno Therapeutics  for $87 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $9 billion, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. The former already owns approximately 9.7% of outstanding shares of Juno. The CAR-T therapy space was in the spotlight in 2017 as the FDA approved the first CAR-T therapy, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse stage.Zacks Rank & Key PickCelgene carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock from the health care space is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

This officially unlocked a procedure using which the tax code can be changed using a simple majority of only Republican votes, instead of the 60 votes norm usually followed. Trump and his fellow Republicans had campaigned on bringing about much needed tax reforms and such an event gets the members of GOP even closer to delivering on their promise.In a 216 to 212 vote, the House cleared the budget blueprint, with as many as 20 Republicans voting against it. Meanwhile, House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brad stated that the budget Bill would be introduced on Nov 1. Apart from tax repatriation, the framework also promises to almost double the standard deduction of tax rates and add as much as $1.5 trillion to deficits over a period of 10 years.ECB Extends Quantitative EasingThe ECB announced on Thursday that it will be slashing the level of bond purchases every month, but, will extend the length of the time the stimulus program runs. ECB promised to buy €30 billion in bonds from €60 billion, beginning in January. The central bank intends to extend its monetary stimulus program until at least September 2018.The ECB also reiterated that interest rates would remain at their current levels well past the end of the quantitative easing (QE) program.Economic DataPending home sales for the month of September remained unchanged from August, whereas the consensus estimate for the period was a decline of 0.5%. With this, the index hit a two and a half year low. Such a lackluster show can be attributed to extremely short supply amidst strong demands.  Meanwhile, initial jobless claims decreased to 233,000 — still languishing at historically low levels. The consensus estimate for the period was an increase to 235,000.Stocks That Made HeadlinesDeckers Defies Retail Challenges, Tops on Q2 EarningsIt was not UGG but sturdy sales performance across HOKA ONE ONE and Teva brands coupled with lower cost of sales and SG&A expenses that enabled Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK  -  Free Report) to post better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.

3231,CELG,"Welcome to the fully open spigot of Q3 earnings season. It is the single busiest day of the quarter, and after the bell we will see results from GOOGL, MSFT, INTC and others. Plenty of S&P 500 companies have already reported earnings before the opening bell today, and if that’s not enough, we’ve also got tons of economic data and newsworthy financial information to get to. So let’s get started:European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi has extended the quantitative easing program that has helped foster the Eurozone back to good health. Euro buybacks, which were scheduled to have expired in December, will now taper off beginning in January and continue through September of next year.Buybacks will be cut in half to 30 billion euros per month. As a result, we see the euro fall in value, but not drop out of its range. In his statement, Draghi expressed that risks to growth in the Eurozone are “broadly based” and the economic expansion is “solid.”Initial Jobless Claims also stayed range-bound at 233K last week, up 10K from the slightly revised 223K the previous week. Continuing claims stayed even at 1.893 million. A few weeks ago, we saw a spike in initial jobless claims following the double-whammy of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but weekly claims have reverted back to the favorable 225-250K range we’ve seen for the past couple years.Wholesale inventory rose 0.3% in its latest read, while Retail inventory fell 1%. Growth via inventory increases is widely considered one of the weakest economic growth metrics, whereas drawdowns on inventory make room for new products to hit the market. Consider this report another modest positive for the current U.S. economy.Q3 Earnings, ContinuedTwitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) shares are spiking up 12% in today’s pre-market following a better-than-expected Q3 earnings report: 10 cents per share topped the 7 cents we were expecting, whereas $589.6 million in quarterly sales modestly outpaced the $589.3 million in the Zacks consensus. Monthly active users grew 4% to 330 million, as the company has taken steps to clean up its operations in light of allegations of abuse of the platform. CEO Jack Dorsey is also pointing Twitter in the direction of video streaming to increase usage going forward.Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) followed a recent strong Q3 report from GM by beating estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning: earnings of 43 cents per share outperformed the 32 cents expected in the Zacks consensus. Quarterly revenues of $33.6 billion improved over the $32.9 billion estimate. The automotive giant also raised the lower end of its full-year guidance from $1.65 per share to $1.75, and recorded an all-time high in pre-tax profit from its Asia-Pacific region. Shares went up 1.6% on the report.United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) reported $1.45 per share in its quarterly report this morning, beating estimates by a penny. Revenues came in strongly ahead of expectations: $15.98 billion surpassed the $15.61 billion in the Zacks consensus. Though UPS reported a $50 million cost as a result of the hurricanes, the company also raised the lower end of earnings guidance for full-year 2017. UPS also looks forward to a potential record holiday season in Q4, though pre-market trades have sent shares into slightly negative territory.However, biopharma major Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) shares have fallen more than 16% in today’s pre-market on quarterly revenue numbers that came in far short of expectations. Though profits beat estimates, $1.91 per share versus $1.88 anticipated, $3.29 billion in Q3 sales missed the $3.42 billion estimate. Full-year profit and revenue guidance has been lowered, as well as long-term targets to year 2020.

3232,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in third-quarter 2017 wherein earnings beat expectations but sales failed to meet estimates.The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.91 per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.88, up from $1.58 in the year-ago quarter.Total revenues grew 10.2% to $3.29 billion in the quarter but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.42 billion. Revenues were boosted by consistent performance of the company’s key growth driver, Revlimid. However, sales of Otezla in the United States were weak. Celgene’s stock has fallen 3.5% in the last six months as against the industry’s  gain of 3.2%. Shares of the company are down in the pre-market trading due to revenue miss in the third quarter.  The stock was hit earlier after a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) was discontinued.Revlimid Continues to ShineNet product sales increased 10.6% year over year to $3.28 billion. Net sales of Revlimid came in at $2.0 billion, reflecting 10% year-over-year growth. The drug performed well in the United States (up 17.9%). Growth in the reported quarter was driven by increased volume as a result of increases in duration of treatment and market share.Net sales of another cancer drug, Abraxane increased 7.7% to $251 million as sales grew both in the United States and international markets. Sales of oncology drug, Pomalyst/Imnovid, came in at $417 million, up 22.3%. Sales were driven by increased volume from duration gains.Otezla reported sales of $308 million in the reported quarter, up 12%. Sales in the United States were impacted by an increase in gross-to-net adjustments from contracts implemented in January and a slowing in overall category growth due to a more challenging market access environment.All other product sales (including Istodax, Thalomid, Vidaza and an authorized generic version of Vidaza in the United States) totaled $226 million in the reported quarter, down from $228 million from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted research and development expenses increased 8.6% to $698 million due to increased spending related to drug discovery and clinical trial activity while adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 11.8% to $521 million.Last month, Celgene announced that the FDA put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program. Partial clinical hold has been put on five trials and a full clinical hold on one trial. The trials were evaluating Imfinzi, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in combination with immunomodulatory and chemotherapy agents in blood cancers such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma. Celgene entered into a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC's (AZN  -  Free Report) MedImmune in April 2015 to develop and commercialize Imfinzi for hematologic malignancies in combination with Revlimid, Pomalyst, Vidaza and others. The FDA placed a hold on these trials due to risks identified in other trials for an anti-PD-1 antibody, Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, in patients with multiple myeloma in combination with immunomodulatory agents.Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation Quote2017 Outlook UpdatedCelgene updated its guidance for 2017. The company anticipates earnings in the range of $7.30-$7.35 compared with the previous guidance of $7.25-$7.35 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $7.34 per share. Revenues are now projected at $13 billion compared to the earlier projection of $13-13.4 billion.Revlimid sales are projected between $8 billion and $8.3 billion. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.6 billion. However, Otezla sales are now projected at $1.25 billion, down from the previous projection of $1.5-$1.7 billion.Our TakeCelgene’s third-quarter results were mixed with the company beating on earnings but missed on sales estimates. While Revlimid sales were impressive yet again, Otezla sales in the United States were weak which led the management to reduce annual guidance for the drug. Consequently, the company updated its annual guidance.In August 2017, the company obtained FDA approval for Idhifa (enasidenib) for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The drug was developed in partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AGIO  -  Free Report). Going forward,  we expect approval of new drugs to boost the top line.Zacks Rank Celgene is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3233,CELG,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 3, before the market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.81%.This generic drug maker’s shares have lost 5.1% this year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 5.9%.Teva’s earnings surpassed expectations in only one of the last four quarters, met the same in one and missed expectations in the remaining two, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.49%. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIncreased pricing erosion, volume declines in the U.S. Generics unit, rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone and declines in sales of several other products in the Specialty segment are expected to hurt Teva’s top line in the first quarter.Significant competitive and pricing pressure in the generics industry is hurting sales of Teva’s Generics unit. The ongoing consolidation of customers in the generics industry is resulting in increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. Accelerated FDA approval of additional generic versions of competing off-patent medicines, increased competition for its largest product - Concerta authorized generic – and stringent government regulations are also hurting sales.Meanwhile, in the Specialty segment, loss of exclusivity of key drugs like Copaxone, Azilect and Nuvigil and divesture of some non-core assets in the Women’s Health business will hurt sales.Sales of blockbuster multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment, Copaxone are likely to erode due to lower volumes of the 20 mg and the 40 mg formulation, which are facing generic competition. Glatopa, a generic version of Copaxone 20 mg, is being marketed by Momenta and Sandoz - Novartis’ generic arm - since 2015 while Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its version of the 20 mg formulation in October 2017. In the same month, in a major blow to Teva, Mylan launched (at-risk) its generic version of the 40 mg thrice-weekly formulation, much earlier than expected.With the entry of the generic version of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation, there has been rapid erosion in sales of Copaxone. Moreover, a second generic version of the 40 mg formulation (Glatopa) was launched by Sandoz in February this year, much earlier than its scheduled launch in April.To combat the rapid decline in sales, in December, Teva announced a restructuring plan that will see more than 25% of the company’s global workforce being laid off over the next two years with the majority expected in 2018. An update on the progress made so far on the restructuring plan is also expected on the call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Teva is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is +2.71% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 70 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 68 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Teva has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some drug/biotech stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMAG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +31.28% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on May 3.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.63% and a Zacks Rank #2.

3234,CELG,"We expect Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) to surpass expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on May 4, before the market opens. Last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.70%.Shares of Agios have soared 67.7% in a year’s time, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 12.5%. The company’s earnings track record shows mixed results with the company having outpaced estimates twice in the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two. Overall, Agios came up with an average negative surprise of 1.34%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayAgios’ only marketed drug is Idhifa (enasidenib), which received an FDA approval last August for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) having an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. Per the last report, the drug generated strong sales and we expect encouraging revenues in the first quarter as well.Moreover, Agios’ progress with the pipeline has been quite impressive. In fact, investors’ focus will remain on the same in the to-be-reported quarter. Two interesting candidates in the company’s cancer portfolio are IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AG-120 (ivosidenib) and a pan-IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881.Ivosidenib is under priority review in the United States for treating patients with R/R AML with an IDH1 mutation. An approval for ivosidenib is expected in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, the company anticipates a regulatory filing for the candidate in the EU during the fourth quarter of 2018 for the same indication.Ivosidenib is also being evaluated in phase I study for addressing advanced hematologic malignancies and combined with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Vidaza, it is under assessment in phase I/II, for the cure of newly diagnosed AML patients, who are not eligible for an intensive chemotherapy.Meanwhile, Agios is conducting phase I programs on AG-881 for treating patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors including glioma. In the second half of 2017, the company announced positive findings from the study.Notably, the company also plans to initiate a perioperative window trial to analyze ivosidenib and AG-881 in low grade glioma for investigating the effects on brain tumor tissue in the first half of 2018.The company has another interesting candidate in its portfolio. Its lead rare genetic diseases candidate, AG-348, is under evaluation in a phase II trial on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase deficiency. Agios reported positive data from the program in June 2017. The FDA granted a fast track designation to the candidate for the given indication. As the RGD market still remains unexplored, newer therapies in this area hold huge potential.Nonetheless, this March, Agios announced commencement of a phase I study, evaluating its first-in-class methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) inhibitor, AG-270, for patients with solid tumors or lymphoma with deletion of the MTAP. We expect management to produce an update on the same in first-quarter earnings release.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Agios is likely to beat on earnings this reporting cycle because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Agios has an Earnings ESP of +1.72%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate (loss of $1.57 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (loss of $1.60). A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Agios has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and together with a positive ESP, chances of an earnings beat in the stock’s upcoming release are pegged higher.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3235,CELG,"ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 4 before the market opens. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 42.86%.ImmunoGen’s earnings performance has been a mixed bag in the recent past. The company surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters, missing the same in the other two. Overall, ImmunoGen pulled off an average negative surprise of 0.50%.Shares of ImmunoGen have significantly outperformed the industry  so far this year. The stock has skyrocketed 71.1% against the industry’s decrease of 2.1%. Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayIn absence of an approved product in ImmunoGen’s portfolio, investors’ focus should remain on the company’s progress with its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine, and other programs.ImmunoGen has significantly advanced with respect to mirvetuximab soravtansine. Recently, the company successfully completed the interim analysis of a phase III study (FORWARD I), evaluating the candidate as a single-agent therapy for treating patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, whose tumors express high or medium levels of FR alpha. The company has also finished full enrollment of the trial two months ahead of schedule and expects top-line results from the program during the first half of 2019.Also, combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine to address ovarian cancer are in phase Ib/II FORWARD II study. The trial consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Merck’s Keytruda. Initial findings from the study demonstrated that the candidate has potential to complement all available therapies for the indication. Updated outcomes from the program are expected in the first half of 2018.Apart from mirvetuximab soravtansine, ImmunoGen is working to develop a couple of early-stage candidates including IMGN779 and IMGN632. Last December, the company presented positive results from the ongoing phase I study, evaluating IMGN779 on patients with relapsed or refractory adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at the annual meeting of American Society of Hematology. Moreover, this January, the company moved IMGN632 into phase I study to treat hematological malignancies including AML.Per fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, the company issued its cash guidance for 2018, anticipating cash and cash equivalents in the range of $115-$120 million by the end of December 2018. ImmunoGen had then stated that it hoards enough funds to run its operations through the fourth quarter of 2019.What the Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that ImmunoGen is likely to beat estimates this reporting cycle. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: ImmunoGen has an Earnings ESP of -3.07%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 28 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 27 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ImmunoGen has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company needs a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

3236,CELG,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter 2017 loss of $1.81 per share, wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.65 and the year-ago loss of $1.34.Total revenues in the reported quarter amounted to $9.8 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16 million. Revenues plunged 56.6% from the year-ago figure of $22.6 million due to lower collaboration revenues.However, Agios shares increased almost 2% despite reporting wider loss and lower revenues as the company sounds bullish on its pipeline progress. In fact the stock has outperformed the industry in a year’s time, having surged 69.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 15.1%. Notably, in August 2017, Agios’ only marketed drug Idhifa (enasidenib), received an FDA approval for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation.

The drug posted revenues of $13 million in the reported quarter.Research & development expenses were up 19.3% year over year to $77.2 million, largely driven by escalated costs associated with the ivosidenib program.General and administrative expenses increased 47.4% year over year to $22.7 million due to higher costs related to investment in increasing commercial capabilities of Idhifa and the potential launch of ivosidenib in 2018.In December 2017, Agios submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for ivosidenib (AG-120), which has been developed for treating patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation. The NDA submission was based on encouraging data from dose expansion part of an ongoing phase I study, evaluating the candidate as a single agent on patients with advanced hematologic malignancies and an IDH1 mutation. An approval for ivosidenib is expected in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, the company anticipates a regulatory filing for the candidate in the EU in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the given indication.2017 ResultsFull-year sales decreased 38.5% year over year to $43 million. Sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $49.3 million.The full-year loss of $6.75 per share was also wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $6.59.

In October 2017, the company announced positive data from the study.The company has another interesting candidate, AG-348, in its portfolio. This lead rare genetic diseases candidate is under evaluation in a phase II study on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Last December, Agios reported impressive data from the trial, demonstrating the candidate’s potential as the first disease-modifying therapy for patients with PK deficiency.

3237,CELG,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full year 2017 results on Feb 14, before the opening bell.Shares have soared 61.4% in a year’s time, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 12.8%. Agios’ earnings track record shows strong results with the company having surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters and missed the same once. Overall, Agios has an average beat of 4.48%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 8.62%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayAgios’ only marketed drug is Idhifa (enasidenib), which received FDA approval in August, last year for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. Though the drug recorded nominal revenue in the last quarter, it is expected to add significantly to the company’s top line in the fourth-quarter release.Moreover, Agios’ progress with the pipeline has been quite impressive in the fourth quarter. In fact, investors’ focus will remain on the same in the to-be reported quarter. Two interesting candidates in the company’s cancer portfolio are IDH1 mutant inhibitor, AG-120 (ivosidenib) and a pan-IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881.In December 2017, Agios submitted a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for AG-120 which has been developed for treating patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation. The NDA submission was based on encouraging data from dose expansion part of an ongoing phase I study, evaluating the candidate as a single agent on patients with advanced hematologic malignancies and an IDH1 mutation.Meanwhile, Agios is conducting phase I programs on AG-881 for treating patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors including glioma. In October 2017, the company announced positive data from the study.Notably, Agios is busy developing AG-881 in collaboration with Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report), which should fetch in collaboration revenues.The company has another interesting candidate, AG-348, in its portfolio. This lead rare genetic diseases candidate is under evaluation in a phase II study on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Last December, Agios reported impressive data from the trial, demonstrating its potential as the first disease-modifying therapy for patients with PK deficiency.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Agios is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Agios has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $1.65. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Agios has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.   We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Quote Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Exelixis, Inc.

3238,CELG,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $3.27 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 by 5.8% and increased 15% from the year-ago period. Better revenues and lower operating costs drove the bottom line. A lower tax rate and share count also pulled up profits.Total revenue rose 2% to $5.81 billion in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.67 billion by 2.5%. An unfavorable impact of foreign exchange hurt sales by 1% in the quarter.While U.S. revenues rose 2% and ex-U.S. sales grew 8%, excluding currency headwinds.Quarter in DetailTotal product revenue rose 2% from the year-ago quarter to $5.57 billion (U.S.: $4.39 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.19 billion) as strong demand for newer products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolisand Blincyto somewhat made up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Revenues of Amgen’s erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), Aranesp, rose 6% from the year-ago quarter to $535 million due to higher unit demand in the U.S.Revenues of the other ESA, Epogen, declined 12% to $292 million due to lower selling price owing to a recently negotiated contract with DaVita Inc.Neulasta revenues declined 5% to $1.09 billion from the year-ago period due to lower unit demand following competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapies. Neupogen recorded a 30% decline in sales to $137 million due to biosimilar competition in the U.S. Zarxio, Sandoz’s (Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm) biosimilar version of Neupogen, was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015 and is hurting sales.The company expects Neulasta and Neupogen sales to continue to be hurt by competitive dynamic through the rest of 2017. However, management did specify on the call, that “no new U.S. biosimilar competition” is expected this year. This suggests that Neulasta and Epogenmay not start facing any biosimilar competition in the U.S. this year, contrary to previous expectations.However, the Neulasta Onpro kit (on-body injector) continues to perform well commanding a market share of about 55% in the U.S. for all Neulasta sales.Enbrel delivered revenues of $1.47 billion, down 1% from the year-ago quarter due to increased competition, which offset favorable changes in inventory and price.However, in the quarter, market volume growth improved in the rheumatology/dermatology segments compared with the first quarter with Enbrel experiencing relatively stable unit share in these markets.Prolia revenues came in at $505 million, up 15% from the year-ago quarter due to higher demand. The osteoporosis drug witnessed market share gains in both the U.S. and our international markets.Meanwhile, Xgeva delivered revenues of $395 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter mainly due to higher demand.Sensipar/Mimpara revenues increased 10% to $427 million due to higher price increases.Vectibix revenues came in at $168 million, up 5%, driven by higher demand.Kyprolis recorded sales of $211 million, up 23% year over year driven by higher demand.In the quarter, Amgen submitted regulatory applications in the U.S. and EU to include overall survival data from the ENDEAVOR study on the label of Kyprolis. The study demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Velcade plus dexamethasoneThis overall survival data, if approved, can help drive usage and boost sales of Kyprolis.Amgen also announced final data from the phase III ASPIRE study of Kyprolis this month, which showed that a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis plus Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd ) significantly improved overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma compared to Revlimidand dexamethasone(Rd).Blincyto sales surged 43% from the year-ago period to $43 million, reflecting higher demand. Earlier this month, the FDA approved the inclusion of overall survival data from the TOWER study on the label of Blincyto. The addition of the data should help boost sales.Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha generated revenues of $83 million, higher than $49 million in the first quarter driven by higher demand.Uptake of the drug, which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent.We remind investors that a phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER) on Repatha had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes in the first quarter. The data is key to commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use of the drug. Though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data. Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in Jun 2017.Operating Margins IncreaseAdjusted operating margins rose 380 basis points (bps) to 55.2% due to lower operating costs, reflecting continued benefits from transformation and process improvement efforts.R&D expenses declined 3% in the quarter due to lower late-stage pipeline related costs. SG&A spend declined 7% due to the Oct 2016 expiration of Enbrel residual royalty payments, which offset investments to support new product launches.Amgen bought back shares worth $1 billion in the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, Amgen had $2.5 billion remaining under its $5 billion stock repurchase plan.2017 GuidanceWhile Amgen slightly cut the lower end of the previously issued sales outlook, it raised the earnings guidance to account for strong first-half profits.The company expects total revenue in the range of $22.5 billion to $23.0 billion versus $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion expected previously. Adjusted earnings are now expected in the range of $12.15 to $12.65 in 2017 compared with $12.00 to $12.60 per share, expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues in 2017 is pegged at $12.40 per share and $22.62 billion, respectively.Operating expenses are expected to be higher in the second half.Our TakeIt was a rather strong quarter for Amgen as it beat expectations for both earnings and sales and raised its earnings guidance. Shares, however, lost 2.4% in after-market trading probably due to concerns related to the tightened revenue guidance. However, so far this year, Amgen’s shares are up 23.7%, better than the 12.7% increase registered by the industry.Though Amgen’s newer products – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well, their volume growth may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brands like Enbrel due to competitive pressure. However, Amgen’s restructuring plan should make it leaner and more cost efficient. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline, including biosimilar drugs, given quite a few regulatory and data updates scheduled for the second half.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3239,CELG,"The second quarter earnings season is off to a strong start. As of July 25, approximately 128 S&P 500 companies or 36.1% of the index’s total membership have reported results.  A deep look into the results show that earnings for the companies reported so far are up 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. Of these, 77.3% have topped earnings estimates while 70.3% have beat on revenue estimates. However, the pace of growth is below the first quarter but in line with the four-quarter average and has improved over the 12-quarter average. Going forward, estimates for the third quarter are going down. The estimate for Q3 growth is 4.8%, down from 6% at the start of the quarter.The Pharma sector has more or less combated the overall decline in the financial markets and maintained momentum.  Last week, industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. Swiss major Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) reported encouraging second-quarter results. Meanwhile, biotech giant Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the second quarter of 2017 and raised its annual guidance.Let’s take a look at three biotech companies that are set to report second-quarter results on Jul 27.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company beat earnings estimates by 16.7%.Bristol-Myers has a decent track record so far. The company’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.39%. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a 0.00% Earnings ESP . Although the current rank increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes it unlikely for the stock to beat estimatesthis quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Bristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, is expected to continue to drive the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Although the first quarter saw some stability in the second-line lung cancer, the recent FDA approval of Merck & Co., Inc.  (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC will impact sales.

Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 4.08%.Celgene’s key product, Revlimid, is expected to continue to be the main growth driver as in the first quarter, driven by share gains in important markets and longer treatment duration in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla continue to perform well. In the second-quarter call, investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front. Celgene has submitted a new drug application to the FDA for Idhifa in relapsed refractory AML in 2016. The NDA for Idhifa was granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Aug 30.Celgene’s track record has been pretty decent with the company toppingearnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 3.01%.

3240,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 4.08%.Celgene has outperformed the Zacksclassified industry in the year so far. The stock has gained 19% during this period against the industry’s11.8% gain.Celgene’s track record has been pretty decent with the company beating earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 3.01%.Let's see how things are shaping up at the company ahead of this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Celgene is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.62%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.62 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.61. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the first-quarter earnings results, Celgene updated its outlook for 2017. The company now expects earnings around $7.15–$7.30 compared to the earlier forecast of $7.10–$7.25 per share. Net product sales are expected around $13.0–$13.4 billion.Celgene’s key product, Revlimid, should continue to be the main growth driver as in the first quarter, driven by share gains in important markets and longer treatment duration in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM).  Revlimid sales are projected between $8 billion–$8.3 billion.Currently, Celgene is working on expanding Revlimid’s label further. FDA approved Revlimidfor use as a maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after they receive an autologous stem-cell transplant. The drug was also approved in the EU for the same. NDMM market share continues to grow outside the U.S., with a positive uptake both in the EU and in Japan. A label expansion of the drug is expected to boost sales further.Meanwhile, a broad phase III program evaluating Revlimid in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is underway.Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla continue to perform well. Both Otezla and Pomalyst achieved blockbuster status in 2016, recording over $1 billion in sales. Otezla sales in the first quarter were impacted by managed care dynamics that led to lower total marketplace prescriptions for psoriasis therapies although the pressure is expected to ease as the year goes.Pomalyst/Imnovid is being evaluated in multiple combination studies in relapsed/refractory MM. The drug’s label was recently updated in the U.S. and the EU to include data from a pooled pharmacokinetics analysis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM and impaired renal function.  Pomalyst, in combination with Darzalex and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma, is under FDA review.For 2017, Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. While Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.6 billion, the same for Otezla are estimated around $1.5 billion– $1.7 billion.Meanwhile, R&D expense as a percentage of revenues is expected to increase throughout the year.In the second-quarter call, investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front. Celgene has submitted a new drug application to the FDA for Idhifa in relapsed refractory AML in 2016. The NDA for Idhifa was granted Priority Review with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Aug 30. We note that Celgene has inked an agreement with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO  -  Free Report) for Idhifa.Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteStocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.3% and a Zacks Rank #1.

3241,CELG,"We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports its second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes.Year to date, Vertex’s shares have soared 116.3% while the industry has recorded an increase of 11.2%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three and missed expectations in one of the last four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 406.25%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex posted a positive surprise of 225%.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlaySales of Vertex’s both cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — rose in the first quarter. We expect this positive trend to continue in the second as well.In May 2017, Kalydeco gained an FDA approval for use in patients 2 and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Over 900 people in the U.S. have one of these mutations. Following the approval, Vertex upped its Kalydeco 2017 revenue guidance to $740-$770 million. We expect this expanded indication to boost Kalydeco sales in the second quarter.Orkambi’s sales growth will be dependent on reimbursement discussions in Europe in 2017. Last week, Vertex announced that it has struck a re-imbursement agreement in Italy for Orkambi, thereby making the medicine more accessible in the country. Though the reimbursement agreement will not be beneficial in the second quarter, it should contribute to sales in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, the company had also mentioned that if it gains reimbursement in France this year, it would contribute significantly to revenue growth this year.Vertex is also evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor.Data from VX-152 and VX-440 phase II and VX-659 phase I triple combination studies presented earlier this week, have showed that all three combinations led to a pronounced improvement in lung function. Phase II study on VX-659 is expected to be initiated in early Aug. Phase II studies on the fourth next-generation corrector, VX-445 (triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor), are already going on. Data from VX-445 and VX-659 phase II studies are expected in early 2018. Thereafter, upon discussion with regulatory agencies, Vertex will initiate its pivotal studies on one or more of these triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population.Investor focus at the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, crucial for long-term growth of Vertex.However, operating expenses are likely to shoot up as Vertex expands its pipeline.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Vertex is likely to beat estimates this quarterbecause it has the right combination of two key ingredients. For astock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (earnings of 10 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (earnings of 6 cents), stands at +66.7%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Vertex currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3242,CELG,"HCA Healthcare, Inc. (HCA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.Last quarter, this hospital company posted in-line results. It has, however, surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.47%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackThe company’s commercial volumes have been stressed over the past few quarters. It has taken  efforts to build out its local networks and create greater patient access both from an outpatient facilities standpoint and a digital media standpoint to address the issue. We, however, don’t expect to see any major improvement in this business in the second quarter.Last quarter, the company reported the 12th consecutive quarter of equivalent admission growth for HCA and we expect the trend to continue in the second quarter.HCA Healthcare consistently makes capital expenditure for the expansion of services and capacity in its large fast growing urban markets. In 2016, it incurred $2.76 billion in this regard and expects to invest $2.9 billion in 2017. The company has also made a number of acquisitions over the past many years to expedite growth. We believe these investments will generate top-line growth by increasing business volumes.Share bought back by the company during the to-be reported will cushion the bottom line. The company has not paid regular dividend since its IPO in 2011. It prefers share buyback over dividend payment for allocating capital and will maintain its current policy on dividend payouts.HCA Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise HCA Holdings, Inc.

3243,CELG,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25 after the market closes. Amgen delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.0% in the last quarter.Amgen shares are up 22.6% so far this year. This compares favorably with the 10.5% increase registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company reporting positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.31%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAmgen’s growth products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, Vectibix, Nplate, Sensipar are likely to perform well. While new patient adoption and repeat injections might drive Prolia sales, Xgeva is likely to benefit from its superior clinical profile versus competition. Parsabiv (etelcalcetide), for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), was approved in the U.S in Feb 2017 and in EU in Nov 2016. The drug is likely bring in some revenues in the second quarter.However, the company has some challenges in store given the presence of biosimilar competition and slowdown in sales of mature products. Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen sales are expected to be hurt by competition in the EU. Note that Neupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the U.S. mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s, Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) generic arm, biosimilar version of Neupogen, which was launched in the U.S. in Sep 2015. Neupogen is expected to face continued competitive pressure this year from the existing and potential biosimilars.Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition in the U.S. this year, though no biosimilars were launched in the second quarter.Meanwhile, blockbuster drug Enbrel is facing increasing competition in the rheumatology/dermatology segments, which will hurt sales.Volume growth of recently launched products may not be enough to offset the decline in mature brandsThe bottom line will however benefit from the company’s overall cost-cutting efforts and share buyback. The company’s restructuring plan will make it leaner and more cost efficient.Investor focus will remain on the performance of the company’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in Aug 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions.A phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (FOURIER) on Repatha had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes in the first quarter. The data is key to the commercial success of Repatha as it would broaden the use of the drug. Though data from the study looks good, it is not very clear if payers will be willing to improve access to Repatha based on this data. Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the U.S. and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in Jun 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.32% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.08 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.09. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Amgen Inc.

3244,CELG,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter 2017 results. While earnings beat expectations, sales missed the same. However, the drug and consumer products giant raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook, which sent shares up more than 1% in pre-market trading.This year so far, J&J’s share price is up 14.7%. This compares favorably with the 11.3% increase witnessed by the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.Earnings BeatJ&J’s second-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $1.83 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 and increasing 5.2% from the year-ago period.Including one-time items, J&J reported second-quarter earnings of $1.40 per share, down 2.1% from the year-ago period.Sales Miss AgainSales came in at $18.84 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.89 billion by 0.3%. Sales increased 1.9% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 2.9% and a negative currency impact of 1%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 0.5% on an operational basis.Second-quarter sales grew 1.6% in the domestic market to $9.73 billion and 2.3% in international markets to $9.11 billion, reflecting 4.4% operational growth, partially offset by a 2.1% negative currency impact.Sales in DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales declined 0.2% year over year to $8.64 billion, reflecting 1% operational growth and 1.2% negative currency impact. Higher sales in international markets offset a weaker performance in the U.S.Sales in the domestic market declined 2.6% to $5.01 billion, while international sales grew 3.3% to $3.63 billion.New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Other growth drivers were Xarelto, Stelara and Invega Sustenna.However, sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 23%. Also, Concerta declined 23.9% while Zytiga sales fell 7.2%.Importantly, sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), declined 14% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 13.9% and international sales declining 5.6% due to biosimilar competition. In this regard, we would like to mention that Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) launched its Inflectra injection, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the U.S. late last November. This did not have any significant impact on Remicade sales in the past two quarters. Management is expected to comment on the impact of the biosimilar on second-quarter sales at the conference call.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter. These included the FDA approval for Darzalex to be used in combination with Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Pomalyst (pomalidomide) and dexamethasone for the third-line treatment of multiple myeloma. Importantly, last week, J&J announced FDA approval for its pipeline candidate guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The drug will be marketed by the trade name of Tremfya.Meanwhile, last month J&J completed its previously announced $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion, which will diversify its revenuesto the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) category. Actelion’s PAH drugs added $91 million to the top line in the quarter.Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.73 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 5.9% and negative currency movement of 1%. Sales gained mainly from the inclusion of Abbott Medical Optics acquisition. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 1.1%.Sales in the domestic market rose 6.1% year over year to $3.23 billion. International market sales increased 3.9% (operational increase of 5.8%) year over year to $3.5 billion.Operational growth was driven by the Advanced Surgery business; electrophysiology products in the Cardiovascular business and Acuvue contact lenses in the Vision Care business, which made up for a weaker sales performance in the Diabetes Care unitThe Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.48 billion in the reported quarter, up 1.7% year over year(operational increase of 2.3%). Foreign currency movement negatively impacted sales in the segment by 0.6%. Sales in the domestic market grew 7.4% from the year-ago period to $1.49 billion.Slower growth in baby care products was partially offset by growth in over-the-counter products.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded a decline of 2.2% to $1.99 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 1.1% and a negative currency impact of 1.1%.2017 Guidance RaisedJ&J raised its earnings guidance for 2017 and increased the lower end of its sales outlook.J&J expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.12 - $7.22, including currency impact, compared with $7.00 - $7.15 expected previously.The revenue guidance is in the range of $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion compared with $75.4 billion to $76.1 billion expected previouslyOur TakeDespite the third consecutive sales miss, J&J looks optimistic about a better sales performance in the second half. Chief executive officer, Alex Gorsky said that J&J’s sales growth will accelerate in the second half of the year.Importantly, sales in the Medical Device segment are picking up, which made up for lower sales in the international Consumer and U.S. Pharmaceutical segments in the quarter. Sales in J&J’s domestic Pharma segment have decelerated this year as key growth drivers have slowed down due to competition. Quite a few products in its portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition. However, we believe that new products like Tremfya, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from Actelion could lead to better sales trends in the remaining half of the year.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3245,CELG,"The CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cells) space got a significant boost recently with an FDA advisory panel issuing a positive recommendation for an experimental treatment in this corner of the immune-oncology market. Last week, Swiss pharma giant, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) experimental CAR-T therapy, CTL019, got a unanimous (10-0) vote of approval from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC). Novartis is looking to get CTL019 approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CTL019 is currently under priority review and timely approval would make it the first CAR-T cell therapy to be available.How Does CAR-T Cell Therapy Work?CAR-T falls under the ambit of cellular immunotherapy which involves using a patient’s own immune cells to attack and get rid of harmful disease cells in the body.The CAR-T approach involves -- the collection of a patient’s T cells, their genetic modification outside the body, the incorporation of specific receptors which target cancer cells and finally, the re-infusion of the modified T cells back into the patient.There is a lot of enthusiasm for CAR-T as early stage studies have shown that it can help achieve durable complete responses in some leukemias and lymphomas, including in patients who have suffered multiple relapses. But, CAR-T therapy comes with its own set of challenges including a high level of R&D investment as well as safety issues like serious immune toxicity (CRS) or neurotoxicity. Pricing could be an issue as well as these treatments will not come cheap.However, these treatments have huge commercial potential and could well change the treatment paradigm.5 CAR-T Stocks in FocusGiven the increased focus on this corner of the immune-oncology market and the possibility that a CAR-T drug could enter the market by year end, here is a look at 5 companies that are working on CAR-T cell treatments.Kite Pharma, Inc. : Santa Monica, CA-based Kite is a cell therapy company engaged in the development of innovative cancer immunotherapies with the goal of providing rapid, long-term durable response and eliminating the burden of chronic care. The company’s focus is on CAR and T cell receptor (TCR) engineered cell therapies.Kite is following close on the heels of Novartis where FDA approval of a CAR-T treatment is concerned. Lead pipeline candidate, axicabtagene ciloleucel, is currently under priority review in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A response from the FDA is expected by Nov 29, 2017. The company will be filing for EU approval in the third quarter. Axicabtagene ciloleucel targets the antigen CD19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias.According to the company, the initial market opportunity for axicabtagene ciloleucel includes about 7,400 and 7,000 addressable CAR-T patients in the U.S. and Europe, respectively, while 7,800 new cases are diagnosed in Japan every year and 25,000 in key urban/eastern rural coastal areas of China.Kite has had a strong run so far in 2017 with shares skyrocketing 128.1%, outperforming the Zacks-categorized Medical-Biomedical/Genetics industry which is up about 9%.Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (BLCM  -  Free Report): Houston, TX-based Bellicum is a clinical stage biopharma company working on novel, controllable cellular immunotherapies for different forms of cancer, including hematological cancers as well as solid tumors, and orphan inherited blood disorders. The company’s proprietary chemical induction of dimerization (CID) technology platform is designed to potentially offer better safety and efficacy outcomes compared to other cellular immunotherapies.The company’s pipeline candidates include BPX-501 (an adjunct T-cell therapy for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, registration studies advancing in the EU while preparations are on for registration studies in the U.S.), BPX-601 (GoCAR-T candidate, for solid tumors, designed with the proprietary iMC activation switch to improve efficacy, phase I), and BPX-701 (high affinity TCR candidate, for solid tumors, designed with the CaspaCIDe safety switch, phase I).Bellicum’s shares are down almost 12% year-to-date (YTD), lagging the Zacks-categorized Medical-Drugs industry which is up 5.8% during this period.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. : Seattle, WA-based Juno is another key player in the cellular immunotherapy area. Although the company suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), Juno is now focusing on JCAR017, a CAR-T cell product that targets CD19.Juno is looking to get JCAR017 on the market as early as 2018 for NHL. The company also has a strong partner in Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report).Juno’s shares are up 44.9% YTD.ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (ZIOP  -  Free Report): Boston, MA-based ZIOPHARM is a biotech company that uses innovative gene expression, control and cell technologies to provide safe, effective and scalable cell- and viral-based therapies for cancer and graft-versus-host-disease. ZIOPHARM’s immune-oncology platform includes CAR-T as well as other adoptive cell-based approaches.ZIOPHARM is advancing programs in multiple stages of development together with Intrexon’s RheoSwitch Therapeutic System (RTS) technology, a switch to turn on and off, and precisely modulate, gene expression in order to improve therapeutic index.Within the CAR+ T programs, the company is continuing with a phase I second generation study of CD19 specific CAR+ T for lymphoid malignancies and expects to move third generation CD19 with mbIL15 towards an early-stage study evaluating point-of-care. Plans are also on to commence a phase I study with CD33-specific CAR+ T for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) this year.ZIOPHARM’s shares are up 9.5% YTD.NantKwest, Inc. (NK  -  Free Report): NantKwest is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on using natural killer (NK  -  Free Report) cells to treat cancer, infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases. The company’s NK cell-based platform has been designed to induce cell death against cancer or infected cells by three different modes of action -- direct killing using activated NK cells (aNK); antibody-mediated killing using haNKs; and targeted activated killing using taNKs.NantKwest’s shares are up 19.2% so far in 2017.While Kite, ZIOPHARM, Bellicum and NantKwest are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, Juno is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

3246,CELG,"ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACAD  -  Free Report) is expected to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 8. In the last reported quarter, ACADIA delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.17%. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 11.24% in the last four quarters.ACADIA’s shares have tumbled 47.5% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 10.7%.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayACADIA is focused on developing products for treating unmet medical needs in central nervous system (“CNS”). The performance of its first approved drug, Nuplazid (pimavanserin), for treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease (“PD”) psychosis, has been impressive since its launch in April 2016.The company is also on track with its multi-year plans of developing Nuplazid in indications beyond PD psychosis. The company is studying the drug in five clinical programs for Nuplazid — Alzheimer's disease agitation, Alzheimer’s disease psychosis, Schizophrenia inadequate response, Schizophrenia negative symptoms and major depressive disorders.In October 2017, the company initiated a phase III HARMONY study in dementia-related psychosis or DRP. The company also received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for Nuplazid for the treatment of DRP. Following an End-of-Phase II meeting with the FDA, robust positive results from one phase III study, together with supported data from prior studies with Nuplazid could serve as the basis of a supplementary new drug application.We expect the company to provide further update on the progress of this study during first-quarter earnings call.The company expects that full-year Nuplazid net product sales for 2018 will be between $255 million and $270 million, with net sales for the first quarter of 2018 between $45 million and $48 million. The company expects strong volume growth for Nuplazid.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for ACADIA this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

3247,CELG,"As the first month of 2018 has come to a close, it’s time to look back and see what was hot and what not in this time period. In any case, the market behaved decently. The S&P 500 offered 5.9% gains in the last one month (as of Jan 29, 2017) while the Dow Jones index returned about 6.5% during this time frame.Against this backdrop, let’s delve a little deeper and find out the winning and losing ETFs.Best PerformersUnited States Natural Gas (UNG  -  Free Report) – Up 28.2%Natural gas prices shot up on winter chills. Ample supplies were responsible for downbeat natural gas prices. Normally, Arctic Chills give life to this commodity every winter. The cold snap boosts electricity demand across the region, putting natural gas in focus. The fund thus gained substantially in January (read: Polar Blast Warms Up Natural Gas ETFs).ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF  – Up 24.6%The underlying index of the fund enables investors to take advantage of both event-driven news and long-term trends in the cannabis industry as well as the industries likely to be influenced by the medicinal and recreational cannabis legalization initiatives taking place in many locations globally.The medical marijuana industry is growing by leaps and bounds lately and amassing investors’ interest. While the medical usage of marijuana is legalized in many areas, lately there has been a surge in legalization in the recreational usage of marijuana in some U.S. states. In an election held in 2016, marijuana was declared legal for recreational and medical purposes in seven additional states.Legal marijuana sales surged 34% to $6.9 billion in 2016 according to the cannabis research firm ArcView. The firm expects the sales figure to skyrocket about 213% by 2021. This clearly explains the gains in MJX (read: Rush for Marijuana ETFs Getting Stronger).First Trust China AlphaDEX ETF (FCA  -  Free Report) – Up 21.7%The Chinese economy expanded 6.8% year over year in Q4, the same as in the previous three months and beating market expectations of 6.7%. This makes China ETF a gainful investment tactic.Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF (CNCR  -  Free Report) – Up 21.2%Buyouts in the biotech space are in the spotlight currently. Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) buying Juno Therapeutics Inc  for $9 billion and Sanofi SA (ADR) (SNY  -  Free Report) buying Bioverativ Inc  for $11.6 billion recently are probably pushing the space higher. Plus, the tax reform entails biotech companies to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars stacked in the international economies. This extra cash may be used to buy back shares or pay out dividends in the coming days.Worst PerformersiPath Bloomberg Sugar SubTR ETN  – Down 12%Higher supplies amid weak demand probably weighed on sugar prices which hurt the sugar-related exchange-traded products.iShares Residential Real Estate Capped ETF (REZ  -  Free Report) – Down 5.2%Amid rising interest rates, real estate stocks have underperformed and weighed on the fund.iPath Pure Beta Softs ETN  – Down 4.3%The underlying index of the fund -- the Barclays Commodity Index Softs Pure Beta TR -- reflects the returns that are potentially available through an unleveraged investment in three futures contracts on softs commodities traded on U.S. exchanges. Coffee (43.6%), sugar (36.1%) and cotton (20.4%) are the three holdings of the ETN. A lower sugar price obviously weighed on the fund.WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund (USDU  -  Free Report) – Down 3.8%The fund looks to provide total returns, before expenses, that surpass the performance of the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently promoted a weaker greenback, in order to boost the nation’s trade. This in turn weighed on the U.S. dollar (read: A Tale of Two Currencies and The ETF Impact).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

3248,CELG,"We expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports its third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.Year to date, Vertex’s shares have soared 109.9% while the industry has recorded an increase of 12.1%.Vertex’s track record has been impressive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters and missed expectations in one. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 17.91%. In the last reported quarter, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 11.43%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayVertex’s cystic fibrosis (""CF"") drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — did well in the second quarter. We expect this positive trend to continue in the second as well.In May 2017, Kalydeco gained FDA approval for use in patients 2 years and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (""CFTR"") gene. Over 900 people in the United States have one of these mutations. In August, Kalydeco received approval for CF patients who have one of five residual function mutation, which causes splicing defect in the CFTR gene. Over 600 people in the United States have one of these mutations. Following these approvals for label expansion, Vertex upped its Kalydeco 2017 revenue guidance to $770-$800 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kalydeco for the third quarter is $197 million.Orkambi’s sales growth will be dependent on reimbursement discussions in Europe in 2017. In June and July this year, Vertex struck re-imbursement agreements in Ireland and Italy, respectively, for Orkambi, thereby making the medicine more accessible in the countries. The expanded accessibility is expected to bring in more sales for the drug.In the first quarter, the company had also mentioned that if it gains reimbursement in France this year, it would contribute significantly to revenue growth. However, the company is yet to sign the agreement. The consensus estimate for Orkambi for the third quarter is $322 million.Vertex is also evaluating some next-generation CFTR correctors (VX-152, VX-440, VX-659 and VX-445) as part of a triple combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor. Investor focus at the call will be on these triple combination CF regimens, which are crucial for long-term growth of Vertex.However, operating expenses are likely to shoot up as Vertex expands its pipeline.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Vertex is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP:Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (earnings of 39 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (earnings of 37 cents), stands at +7.24%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Vertex currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

3249,CELG,"Immune Design (IMDZ  -  Free Report) announced that it plans to initiate a pivotal phase III study to support a regulatory application for CMB305, in patients with synovial sarcoma. The company plans to start the study in mid-2018 and enroll 248 patients aged 12 years and older. The decision was based on discussions with the FDA.The phase III study will evaluate CMB305 monotherapy in comparison to placebo in patients with NY-ESO-1+ locally advanced unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma, who have no evidence of progression after first-line chemotherapy. Patents will be randomized 1:1 to receive either CMB305 monotherapy or placebo. The study will have progression free survival (PFS) followed by overall survival (OS) as co-primary endpoints. If the study meets the PFS endpoint, the candidate may get approved by the FDA.So far this year, Immune Design’s stock has rallied 83.6% compared with the industry’s 2.5% gain. CMB305 is one of the primary candidates being developed by Immune Design.

3251,CELG,"Bayer Aktiengesellschaft (BAYRY  -  Free Report) has inked a deal to sell selected Crop Science businesses to BASF for EUR 5.9 billion. Notably, the company intends to divest these assets as a part of its strategy to complete the planned acquisition of Monsanto Co. .The divestiture is subject to the closure of Monsanto deal and Bayer is working with the relevant authorities to end the acquisition by early next year. In fact, the company plans to utilize the net proceeds from the divestiture for partially refinancing the planned acquisition of Monsanto.Markedly, the assets to be divested include Bayer’s global glufosinate-ammonium non-selective herbicide business and the related LibertyLink technology for herbicide toleranceas well as its seed businesses for key row crops in select markets. The transaction includes respective research and development capabilities as well. In 2016, revenue from these businesses amounted to around €1.3 billion.So far this year, Bayer’s shares have outperformed the industry. The stock has rallied 34.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 18.3%.More than 1,800 commercial, R&D, breeding and production personnel will be transferred from Bayer to BASF.Meanwhile, Bayer will continue to own, operate and maintain these businesses until the closing of this divestiture.In Sep 2016, Bayer signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire U.S. seed giant Monsanto Company in a deal worth approximately $66 billion. The combined business is expected to boost Bayer’s Crop Science business and provide accretion to its core earnings from the first full year of the closing of the transaction, followed by double-digit percentage growth.Bayer also expects annual earnings contributions of around $1.5 billion from synergies after three years of closing the transaction, as well as additional future benefits from integrated offerings. We believe that the proposed Monsanto acquisition is a strategic move which will offer Bayer with a broad set of solutions to meet farmers’ current and future needs.Bayer AG Price Bayer AG Price | Bayer AG QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBayer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3252,CELG,"Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its plaque psoriasis drug, Stelara for use in adolescents (12 years of age or older). The drug is approved for adults in this indication since 2009.The company believes that the label expansion is a significant achievement as plaque psoriasis develops before the age of 20 years in approximately one-third of the patients. Moreover, the number of treatments available for adolescents is limited.Patients are administered only four doses a year after two starter doses of Stelara, which has become a leading therapeutic option.Shares of the company are up 18.4% so far this year, almost in line with the industry’s performance. The industry has gained 18.3% in the same time frame.The latest approval for Stelara is based on data from a phase III study, which evaluated the subcutaneous administration of the drug in adolescent patients. The data showed that the drug achieved minimal psoriasis or clear skin in at least two-thirds of the patients. The safety data was also consistent with what was achieved in adult patients.There are almost 7.5 million people suffering from psoriasis in the United States per the American Academy of Dermatology. Moreover, the National Center for Biotechnology Information stated that the majority of psoriasis patients suffer from plaque psoriasis. The numbers represent a huge opportunity for the drug following its label expansion..Moreover, with this approval Stelara has gained an edge over competing drugs like AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira, Novartis AG’s Cosentyx and Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Otezla, which are only approved for adult plaque psoriasis patients. However, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Enbrel will compete with Stelara in the adolescent segment.Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus  Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJohnson & Johnson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3253,CELG,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (VRX  -  Free Report) announced that one of its divisions, Ortho Dermatologics, announced results from the long-term phase III extension study, AMAGINE-2.The study demonstrated that Siliq injection provided sustained high levels of skin clearance (PASI 100) over more than two years in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.The results from a phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AMAGINE-1) which evaluated the efficacy of brodalumab in a subset of patients with prior exposure to ustekinumab, demonstrated that Siliq was similarly efficacious with improved skin clearance in patients both with and without prior ustekinumab exposure.We note that Siliq is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and have failed to respond or have lost response to other systemic therapies. The drug was approved in February.  However, weakness in the dermatology segment persists and is expected to impact the top line.Valeant entered into a collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) granting the former an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Siliq globally, except in Japan and certain other Asian countries where the rights are held by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd.  The agreement was amended in July 2016 to entitle Valeant the right to develop and commercialize brodalumab in Europe.Valeant’s stock has lost 7.2% in the year so far compared to gain of 1.4% for the industry.Once an acquisition giant, Valeant has been caught up in various controversies since October 2015. Following a substantial decline in Valeant’s share price in the first quarter of 2016, Bill Ackman and Steve Fraidin joined the board in March 2016 as part of Pershing Square’s effort to stabilize the company. Thereafter, Joseph C. Papa took charge as the new CEO. The new management took various efforts to turnaround the company.Even though it is still early to comment on the rebuilding process but the company’s efforts to sell non-core assets and lower debt is commendable. The divestiture of non-core assets is expected to help the company streamline its product portfolio and focus on core areas of dermatology and lower debt.Although the approval of new drugs brings some hope, we believe it is still a long road ahead for Valeant before investors faith can be restored in the stock. Earlier in the year, Bill Ackman, chairman of Perishing Square Holdings, Ltd stated that investing in Valeant was a big mistake on his part.Zacks Rank & Key PicksValeant currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.

3254,CELG,"Shares of Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ICPT  -  Free Report) declined 37.4% year to date against the industry’s gain of 15.4%.  In particular, shares have plunged 40.4% over a month due to safety issues regarding approved drug Ocaliva.Per a recent news article, prescriptions of the drug have fallen by 25%. The FDA issued a guideline regarding incorrect dosing of Ocaliva.  The FDA reported 19 deaths due to Ocaliva, approved for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and stated that the drug may also affect the liver.However, Intercept conducted an analysis and concluded that that these patients were prescribed once-daily doses of Ocaliva, which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose. The analysis was conducted in consultation with the FDA. The company concluded that deaths occurred due to overdosing.Consequently, Intercept issued the Dear Healthcare Provider letter. Thereafter, the FDA issued their own safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing. Intercept is also working in tandem with the FDA to develop Ocaliva’s label for safety purposes.We note that Ocaliva was approved in the United States in May 2016 (and subsequently in the European Union and Canada) for the treatment of PBC with an inadequate response to or intolerant to the standard of care, UDCA.The dose recommended for earlier stage PBC patients with no or mild hepatic impairment was 5 mg once daily, which was increased after three months to 10 mg once daily based on tolerability and treatment response. On the other hand, in late stage patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B or C cirrhosis), recommended dosing starts at 5 mg once weekly, with the possibility to gradually increase to a maximum of 10 mg twice weekly.The warning comes a major setback for Intercept and we expect the company’s sales to be hurt in the third quarter due to the same. The company expected the drug’s sales to improve in 2017 as international demand was projected to pick up in the second half. Ocaliva is the company’s only approved drug and such side-effects will limit the sales potential.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIntercept currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.

3255,CELG,"Companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) were in the news with Amgen providing pipeline and regulatory updates while Regeneron and partner Sanofi got some good news with an appeals court ruling in their favor in the PCSK9 inhibitor lawsuit against Amgen.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPhase II Combination Data on Amgen’s Imlygic Published: Positive data on Amgen’s oncolytic viral therapy, Imlygic, when used in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Yervoy were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Results from the mid-stage study showed that the objective response rate (""ORR"") more than doubled when Imlygic was used in combination with Yervoy compared to Yervoy alone in patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV melanoma (39% versus 18%). Moreover, the complete response rate was almost double in the combination arm compared to Yervoy alone (13% versus 7%). Responses were observed in both injected and uninjected lesions, including visceral lesions.Advanced melanoma is highly aggressive and one of the most dangerous types of skin cancer with there being need for multiple treatment approaches over the course of the disease. The data is encouraging and could open up new avenues of revenues for Imlygic if it eventually gains approval for use in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. Sales of Imlygic, approved in October 2015, are yet to pick up.Meanwhile, Amgen said that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application seeking label expansion for the use of Prolia in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. A response from the agency should be out on May 28, 2018. Prolia, which brought in sales of $505 million in the second quarter of 2017, is an important growth driver for Amgen with the company working on improving diagnosis, treatment rates and duration in order to drive access to a greater number of patients (Read more: Amgen Label Expansion Application for Prolia Accepted by FDA).Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Shares of Amgen have gained 27.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 13.9% rally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breather for Amgen with Neulasta Biosimilar Approval Delay: Amgen got a bit of a breather with the FDA issuing a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) for Mylan and Biocon’s biosimilar version of Amgen’s blockbuster drug, Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). While the agency did not raise any queries regarding biosimilarity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, clinical data or immunogenicity of MYL-1401H, the CRL relates to the pending update of the regulatory application with certain CMC data from facility requalification activities post recent plant modifications.We note that Mylan and Biocon are not the only companies to get a CRL from the FDA for a biosimilar version of Neulasta. While Novartis’s Sandoz had received a CRL last year, Coherus was issued a CRL this year in June.  Regeneron/Sanofi Score a Win in PCSK9 Inhibitor Litigation: Regeneron and partner Sanofi got a major boost with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordering a new trial related to Amgen’s claims regarding patents for PCSK9 inhibitors. The court also vacated the permanent injunction in the lawsuit which means Sanofi and Regeneron can continue selling their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, in the United States (Read more: Regeneron and Sanofi Get Favorable Ruling Against Amgen).AbbVie in Immuno-Oncology Deal: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) has entered into a research, option and license agreement with clinical-stage immuno-oncology company Turnstone Biologics. The deal provides AbbVie with an exclusive option to license up to three of Turnstone's next-generation oncolytic viral immunotherapies.Turnstone’s Ad-MG1-MAGEA3 therapy is in a couple of phase I/II studies for different solid tumor indications alone as well as in combination with an approved anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.Promising New Data on Biogen’s Spinraza: New phase III data presented by Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) on Spinraza showed that earlier initiation of treatment with the therapy may improve motor function outcomes in infants and children with spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”). Biogen and Ionis’s Spinraza is the first approved medicine for the treatment of SMA. Spinraza is off to a promising start in the United States bringing in sales of $203 million in the second quarter of 2017.Clovis Seeks Label Expansion for PARP Inhibitor: Clovis Oncology (CLVS  -  Free Report) has filed for label expansion of its PARP inhibitor, Rubraca, in the United States. The company is looking to get the drug approved for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. The company had presented impressive late-stage data earlier this year in June on Rubraca showing that the treatment significantly improved progression-free survival in all ovarian cancer patient populations evaluated in the ARIEL3 study.Rubraca had gained accelerated FDA approval in December 2016 for use in advanced ovarian cancer patients who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies and who have deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations. A broader label would boost Rubraca’s sales potential (Read more: Clovis Submits sNDA for Ovarian Cancer Drug Rubraca).PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up 0.6% over the last five trading sessions.

3256,CELG,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA accepted the company’s new drug application (“NDA”) for its isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutant inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120). The company is seeking to get ivosidenib approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) with an IDH1 mutation. The FDA granted priority review to the candidate and set an action date of Aug 21, 2018.Year to date, Agios’ share price improved 58.2%, compared with the industry’s gain of 16.8%.  Priority Review designation from the FDA is generally granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease. Ivosidenib is being evaluated in a phase I expansion cohort for treatment of patients with IDH1m R/R AML. Data from the study demonstrated durable responses in patients with the given indication. This enabled the company to submit a NDA to the FDA for ivosidenib in December 2017.In addition to the NDA, a premarket approval application was also submitted to the FDA by Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) for the FDA review of an IDH1 assay on the Abbott m2000 RealTime System. The assay automatically prepares samples and analyzes batches for nucleic acid amplification and detection. IDH1 mutations occur in about 6% to 10% of AML patients. The Abbott assay will serve as a companion diagnostic for ivosidenib.Ivosidenib is also being evaluated in phase I study for treatment of advanced hematologic malignancies and phase I/II combination with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Vidaza for treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients, who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.The potential approval of the candidate will boost sales for the company. Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3257,CELG,"Thursday, October 26, 2017Welcome to the fully open spigot of Q3 earnings season. It is the single busiest day of the quarter, and after the bell we will see results from GOOGL, MSFT, INTC and others. Plenty of S&P 500 companies have already reported earnings before the opening bell today, and if that’s not enough, we’ve also got tons of economic data and newsworthy financial information to get to. So let’s get started:European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi has extended the quantitative easing program that has helped foster the Eurozone back to good health. Euro buybacks, which were scheduled to have expired in December, will now taper off beginning in January and continue through September of next year. Buybacks will be cut in half to 30 billion euros per month. As a result, we see the euro fall in value, but not drop out of its range. In his statement, Draghi expressed that risks to growth in the Eurozone are “broadly based” and the economic expansion is “solid.”Initial Jobless Claims also stayed range-bound at 233K last week, up 10K from the slightly revised 223K the previous week. Continuing claims stayed even at 1.893 million. A few weeks ago, we saw a spike in initial jobless claims following the double-whammy of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but weekly claims have reverted back to the favorable 225-250K range we’ve seen for the past couple years.Wholesale inventory rose 0.3% in its latest read, while Retail inventory fell 1%. Growth via inventory increases is widely considered one of the weakest economic growth metrics, whereas drawdowns on inventory make room for new products to hit the market. Consider this report another modest positive for the current U.S. economy.Q3 Earnings, ContinuedTwitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) shares are spiking up 12% in today’s pre-market following a better-than-expected Q3 earnings report: 10 cents per share topped the 7 cents we were expecting, whereas $589.6 million in quarterly sales modestly outpaced the $589.3 million in the Zacks consensus. Monthly active users grew 4% to 330 million, as the company has taken steps to clean up its operations in light of allegations of abuse of the platform. CEO Jack Dorsey is also pointing Twitter in the direction of video streaming to increase usage going forward.Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) followed a recent strong Q3 report from GM by beating estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning: earnings of 43 cents per share outperformed the 32 cents expected in the Zacks consensus. Quarterly revenues of $33.6 billion improved over the $32.9 billion estimate. The automotive giant also raised the lower end of its full-year guidance from $1.65 per share to $1.75, and recorded an all-time high in pre-tax profit from its Asia-Pacific region. Shares went up 1.6% on the report.United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) reported $1.45 per share in its quarterly report this morning, beating estimates by a penny. Revenues came in strongly ahead of expectations: $15.98 billion surpassed the $15.61 billion in the Zacks consensus. Though UPS reported a $50 million cost as a result of the hurricanes, the company also raised the lower end of earnings guidance for full-year 2017. UPS also looks forward to a potential record holiday season in Q4, though pre-market trades have sent shares into slightly negative territory.However, biopharma major Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) shares have fallen more than 16% in today’s pre-market on quarterly revenue numbers that came in far short of expectations. Though profits beat estimates, $1.91 per share versus $1.88 anticipated, $3.29 billion in Q3 sales missed the $3.42 billion estimate. Full-year profit and revenue guidance has been lowered, as well as long-term targets to year 2020.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

Total earnings for the S&P 500 index for the third quarter are expected to be up 3% on 4.9% higher revenues.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 companies which account for 24.7% of index’s total market capitalization have reported results.

Among these, 71.3% beat earnings estimates while 70.1% beat revenue estimates.Medical Sector PerformanceThe Medical sector has performed relatively well till date and this quarter is not going to be any different as per estimates. Of the 5.4% companies that have reported so far, 66.7% beat on revenues while all the companies surpassed earnings expectations. Going forward, the sector is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 1.9% in earnings in Q3.The bellwether of the sector, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and raised its outlook. Swiss giant Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) too beat on both earnings and sales on the back of new drugs like Cosentyx and Entresto. Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter.Here we have four major biotech giants that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 26. Let's see how things are shaping up for these:Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is expected to beat expectations when it reports after the market closes. Per the Zacks model a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Gilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in two of the last four and missing in two. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 17.4%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Specifically, Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Genvoya stands at $919 million. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  (Read more: Is Gilead Poised for a Beat This Earnings Season?)Gilead Sciences, Inc.

The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.We expect the company to beat estimates once again on the back of strong performance of key drug Revlimid.  The drug performed well in the first half and combated the challenges of uneven buying patterns and coverage gap. Continued momentum in core indication, label expansion and global launches should help the product to keep contributing to the top line.

3259,CELG,"Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) third quarter results surpassed both top-and bottom-line expectations. Meanwhile, Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) CAR T therapy gained earlier-than-expected FDA approval. Alexion (ALXN  -  Free Report) also got a regulatory boost with the FDA expanding the label of the company’s flagship product, Soliris.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesBiogen Beats on All Fronts: Although Biogen’s third quarter results were better than expected with the company surpassing both earnings and revenue expectations, shares were down 3.9% on concerns regarding the company’s multiple sclerosis franchise sales as well as U.S. sales of its recently launched spinal muscular atrophy (“SMA”) treatment, Spinraza. Spinraza U.S. sales were $198 million in the third quarter, more or less flat from second quarter sales of $195 million though the company reported a 75% increase in the number of patients on therapy in the United States compared to the end of the second quarter. However, second quarter sales included inventory buildup of $30 million (Read more: Biogen Tops Q3 Earnings & Sales, Spinraza Sales Up).Biogen has gained 11.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 8.2% rally.Gilead CAR T Therapy Yescarta Approved: Gilead’s Yescarta, which became a part of the company’s portfolio following the $11.9 billion Kite Pharma acquisition, gained FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. This makes Yescarta the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy to gain approval for use in this patient population.Yescarta is the second gene therapy to gain approval in the United States, the first being Novartis’s Kymriah. Both treatments come with a Boxed Warning regarding the risks of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and neurologic toxicities.Yescarta’s approval is a major boost for Gilead which is currently facing declining sales from its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise. According to information provided by the company, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) - about 7,500 patients with refractory DLBCL are eligible for CAR T therapy every year. Yescarta represents a new treatment option for these patients who have run out of treatment options and face a poor prognosis. Yescarta will be launched with a list price of $373,000 in the United States and is currently under review in the EU where a response is expected in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Gilead CAR-T Therapy Yescarta Clinches FDA Approval).Gilead also announced phase II results on its investigational treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (""NASH""). The company said that the higher dose (20 mg) of GS-0976, an oral ACC inhibitor, achieved significant reductions in buildup of fat in the liver and a noninvasive marker of fibrosis (TIMP-1) compared to placebo. However, statistical significance was not achieved for other parameters like liver stiffness (by FibroScan and MRE), serum ALT and PIII-NP, a serum marker of fibrogenesis. Meanwhile, differences between the lower dose (5 mg) of GS-0976 and placebo were not statistically significant.Celgene Hit by Crohn’s Disease Study Discontinuation: Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) shares were down 10.8% on news that the company will be discontinuing studies (phase III REVOLVE study and the extension study (SUSTAIN)) being conducted with its investigational Crohn’s disease drug, GED-0301 (mongersen). The decision was based on a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee in October following an interim futility analysis. No meaningful safety imbalances were observed in the analysis.Celgene also said that it will wait to review the full dataset from the phase II ulcerative colitis study on GED-0301 before deciding the path forward. The company will not be initiating the phase III DEFINE study for Crohn’s disease (Read more: Celgene Down on Discontinued Crohn's Disease Drug Study).AbbVie Announces Immuno-Therapy Focused Deals: AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced a couple of deals this week. While one deal is focused on immuno-neurology, the other is focused on immuno-oncology.The immuno-neurology deal will see AbbVie collaborating with Alector for the use of the latter’s immuno-neurology discovery platform for innovative new therapies for Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders.Immuno-neurology, a rapidly evolving scientific area, is focused on harnessing the power of the immune system to attack neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease.While development and commercialization costs as well as profits will be shared equally by the companies, Alector will get an upfront payment of $205 million and a potential, future equity investment of up to $20 million.Meanwhile, the immuno-oncology deal will see AbbVie teaming up with Harpoon Therapeutics for the use of Harpoon's tri-specific T-cell activating construct (TriTAC) platform with AbbVie's research-stage immuno-oncology targets to develop cancer therapeutics (Read more: AbbVie Inks Immuno-Oncology Deal with Harpoon Therapeutics).Label Expansion for Alexion’s Soliris: The FDA granted approval to Alexion for the use of its flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab) in adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are AchR antibody-positive. Soliris, already approved in the United States for serious ultra-rare disorders like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), brought in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3260,CELG,"Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell. Celgene’s stock has moved up 6.1% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 11.8%.Celgene has an excellent track record with the company beating earnings estimates in the last four trailing quarters. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 2.8%. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive surprise of 3.8%. We expect the company to beat estimates once again on the back of strong performance of key drug Revlimid.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Celgene is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.08%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteRevlimid to Drive GrowthConcurrent with the second-quarter earnings results, Celgene raised its guidance for 2017. The company anticipates earnings in the range of $7.25-$7.35 per share compared with the previous guidance of $7.15-$7.30 per share. Net product sales are projected at $13-13.4 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for product sales in the third quarter currently stands at $3.4 billion.Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma. The drug performed well in the first half and combated the challenges of uneven buying patterns and coverage gap. Market share gains in key markets and longer treatment duration are contributing to the drug’s growth.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on expanding Revlimid’s label further. Revlimid received the FDA’s approval for use as a maintenance treatment in NDMM patients after they receive an autologous stem-cell transplant. NDMM market share continues to grow outside the United States, with a positive uptake both in the EU and Japan.Continued momentum in the core indication, label expansion and global launches should help the product to keep contributing to the top line. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Revlimid currently stands at $2.1 billion for the third quarter.Other key products — Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla — continue to perform well. Pomalyst/Imnovid is being evaluated in multiple combination studies in relapsed/refractory MM. The drug’s label was updated in the United States and the Europe to include data from a pooled pharmacokinetics analysis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM and impaired renal function.  Pomalyst, in combination with Darzalex and dexamethasone for relapsed/refractory myeloma was approved in the United States and should propel sales further.The approval of Idhifa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML (R/R AML) will further boost Celgene’s portfolio. The drug was developed in collaboration with Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO  -  Free Report). Otezla achieved the blockbuster status in 2016 driven by solid demand in the United States and trend is expected to continue in 2017. Increased contribution from European countries also impacted sales positively. It is currently being evaluated in phase III studies for Behçet's disease, atopic dermatitis and expanded indications in psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis.The company is keen to expand its oncology franchise beyond Abraxane. Label and geographical expansion of approved drugs in additional indications will increase their commercial potential further. Abraxane sales are estimated to be around $1 billion. While Pomalyst’s revenues are projected around $1.6 billion, the same for Otezla are estimated around $1.5-1.7 billion.During third-quarter earnings call investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front.Other Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.24% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release third-quarter results on Oct 25. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.28% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

3261,CELG,"Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report)is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after the market closes.The company’s earnings history has been disappointing so far, having missed expectations on two occasions, missed in one and registered in-line results in another with an average negative surprise of 55.24%. Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 11.76%.Shares of Conatus have plunged 61% in a year’s time versus the industry’s 12.6% rally. Let’s see, how things are shaping up for the upcoming release.Factors at PlayWith no approved product in Conatus’ portfolio at the moment, the company is yet to generate revenues. Hence, investors’ focus will be on the company’s progress with respect to the lead candidate, emricasan, an orally active pan-caspase protease inhibitor.Emricasan is under evaluation in various phase IIb studies for the treatment of chronic liver disease including NASH fibrosis. There are now four ongoing emricasan phase IIb trials, which consist of three other ENCORE programs on patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in various patient populations. Data from these analyses are expected between 2018 and 2019.The company also plans to initiate a new study called ENCORE-XT, a planned extension trial on patients, who completed the ENCORE-PH or ENCORE-LF studies with continued monitoring for efficacy, safety, clinical outcomes and a healthy quality of life.Apart from emricasan, the company’s portfolio has IDN-7314, presently undergoing a phase II study for treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis. We expect an update on the same on first-quarter conference call.Emricasan has also been extensively profiled in in-vitro tests and studied in many preclinical models of human disease. In April, Conatus announced positive results from both in-vitro and in-vivo studies, demonstrating reductions of hepatic tissue factor-driven coagulation.It is important to note that Conatus has an exclusive option, collaboration and license agreement with Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the worldwide development and commercialization of emricasan. With Novartis sharing half the development costs related to Conatus’ phase IIb studies on emricasan, the company now anticipates lower spending on in-licensing and internal pipeline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Conatus is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Conatus has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 17 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Conatus carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.  We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc.

3262,CELG,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter results on May 1, after the market closes. Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gilead Sciences, Inc. Quote Gilead, a leader in the hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) space, has a decent track record, with the company’s earnings beating estimates in three of the last four while missing in one. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings beat expectations by 4.7%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 7.5%.   Gilead’s stock has rallied 10.5% over a year outperforming the industry's decline of 10.8%.Why A Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Gilead is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates which is what the case is here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Gilead is +0.32%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayConcurrent with the fourth-quarter earnings call, Gilead provided guidance for 2018. Gilead now expects net product sales in the range of $20-$21 billion.Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (“TAF”) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. The TAF-based regimens now represent 62% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume. Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting also put up a strong performance as the company saw a significant uptick in PrEP usage in 2017 with approximately 153,000 patients using Truvada by the end of 2017. Moreover, the franchise received a further boost with the FDA approval of once-daily single tablet regimen (“STR”), Biktarvy (bictegravir 50mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25mg, BIC/FTC/TAF) for HIV-1 infection in February 2018. Hence, sales should get a further boost.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Genvoya is $1074 million. However, Gilead lost exclusivity for Viread in some countries outside the United States which might impact sales.On the other hand, the HCV franchise continues to be under competitive and pricing pressure leading to a massive decline in Harvoni and Sovaldi sales. Harvoni and Sovaldi has been facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR among others.  The franchise suffered a significant plunge in sales due to new competition and fewer patient starts.  Both pricing and market share are expected to stabilize by mid-2018 while patient starts are expected to decline further. HCV revenues are projected to decline further and will constitute a smaller portion of the top-line going forward.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of lead HCV drug Sovaldi and Harvoni are $98 million and $466 million, respectively.Adjusted R&D expenses and adjusted SG&A expenses are projected in the range of $3.4-$3.6 billion and $3.4-$3.6 billion, respectively. Adjusted product gross margin is expected in the range of 85-87%.Meanwhile, the Kite acquisition was a step in the right direction with the FDA approval of its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for the treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. However, management stated that Yescarta launch will be a controlled launch to ensure patient safety as CAR-T therapy is complicated and can sometimes be associated with severe side effects.Gilead is also looking to build up a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis franchise. We expect the management to throw more light on the same during the first-quarter’s call. Investors are also likely to keep an eye on other pipeline updates.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report) is expected to report earnings on May 8.

3263,CELG,"Immune Design Corp. (IMDZ  -  Free Report) isscheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 2.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25.64%. Immune Design topped earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat 19.84%.Immune Design’s shares have lost 10.2% year to date, compared with the industry’s fall of 3.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayBeing a development-stage biopharmaceutical company, Immune Design has not generated any product revenues yet. It earns revenues from collaboration and licensing agreements, and product sales.Investors remain focused on the company’s progress based on its pipeline candidates. Immune Design is developing multiple candidates using two discovery platforms — ZVex and GLAAS — for the treatment of various types of cancers. The company’s key pipeline candidates are CMB305 for solid tumor and G100 for merkel cell carcinoma (“MCC”).CMB305 has been designed under a prime-boost approach, involving the sequential dosing of two complementary agents — LV305 and G305.Currently, this candidate is being evaluated in soft tissue sarcoma patients both as monotherapy (phase I) and in combination with Roche Holding’s (RHHBY) Tecentriq (phase II). The company plans to initiate a pivotal phase III trial studying CMB305 as monotherapy in synovial sarcoma patients in mid-2018. If the progression free survival endpoint is met, the company intends to file a Biologics License Application and seek approval for CMB305 for the treatment of synovial sarcoma.The discussion with the FDA was positive regarding CMB305. Consequently, the company had planned to initiate a pivotal phase III trial studying CMB305 as monotherapy in synovial sarcoma patients. The study is expected to start in mid-2018. It will enroll 248 patients aged 12 and older with NY-ESO-1+ synovial sarcoma who will either receive CMB305 monotherapy or placebo. If the progression free survival endpoint is met, the company intends to file a Biologics License Application and seek approval for CMB305 for the treatment of synovial sarcoma. Meanwhile, G100 is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials, including as a monotherapy with local radiation in a completed phase I study in patients with MCC and in an ongoing investigator-sponsored trial in patients with sarcoma.It is also being developed as a monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (“NHL”), in a randomized phase Ib/II study. In October 2017, G100 received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of follicular NHL from the European Medicines Agency.A potential approval of these pipeline candidates will be a boost for the company.During the earnings call, we expect Immune Design to shed light on the progress of these ongoing trials.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Immune Design this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Immune Design has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

3264,CELG,"Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the market opens.Last quarter the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 44.44%. Keryx’s performance over the last four quarters has been disappointing. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss in the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 25.57%.Keryx’s shares have lost 0.9% year to date, compared with the industry’s 9.9% decline. Factors Influencing This QuarterApart from license fees, Keryx’s top line comprises revenues generated by its only marketed product Auryxia (ferric citrate). Auryxia is used to treat patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.In November 2017, the FDA granted an approval for an additional indication of Auryxia to treat adults with iron deficiency anemia (“IDA”) and chronic kidney disease, not on dialysis. Moreover, Keryx claims that Auryxia is the only oral treatment option available for this indication. Auryxia is already approved to control serum phosphorus levels in adults with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. With the latest approval, this drug can treat two complications of chronic kidney disease.  It also represents a significant opportunity for physicians to treat their patients at an earlier stage of the disease before their anemia becomes more severe. Hence, the approval should significantly boost Auryxia’s sales.Meanwhile, the company is looking for potential partners to commercialize the drug in the EU. Ferric citrate has been considered as a new active substance by the European Commission. This provides it with 10 years of data and marketing exclusivity in the region.The company also remains focused on creating rapid awareness for the new indication and differentiating Auryxia from existing treatment options along with communicating the favorable insurance access to Auryxia that prescribers and patients can expect to see.Further, the company supports a number of ongoing trials, including several investigator-sponsored clinical studies, and one new phase IV study called COMPASS. The COMPASS study will continue to expand the clinical dataset for Auryxia as a treatment for iron deficiency anemia by studying it in people who haven't been treated previously with low iron and in different dosing regimens such as twice-a-day.However, with Auryxia being the only approved product in Keryx’s portfolio, the company is entirely dependent on Auryxia for growth. What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Keryx this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Keryx’s has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 19 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Keryx’s has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement. Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.

3265,CELG,"Summit, NJ based Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs targeting cancer and inflammatory diseases. Celgene’s key growth driver is Revlimid. The company's portfolio also includes Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane, Otezla, Istodax, Vidaza and Thalomid/Thalidomide.However, Celgene is facing generic competition for Vidaza. In this scenario, investor focus remains on the performance of Revlimid and Otezla apart from the usual top-and bottom-line numbers. Meanwhile, Celgene has been striking prudent acquisitions and inking strategic deals to bolster its pipeline. The company is also working on label expansion of its approved drugs.Celgene’s track record has been decent with the company beating earnings estimates on three occasions over the trailing four quarters. Overall, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.80%.Currently, Celgene has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following the company’s earnings report which was just released. We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below:Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Celgene Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Celgene Corporation QuoteEarnings: Celgene beat on third-quarter 2017 earnings. The company reported adjusted EPS of $1.91 while our consensus called for EPS of $1.88.Revenues:  Revenue however missed expectations. Celgene posted revenues of $3.29 billion, missing our consensus estimate of $3.42 billion.Key Stats: While Revlimid continued with its strong performance, Otezla sales were impacted by an increase in gross-to-net adjustments from contracts implemented in January and a slow-down in overall category growth due to a more challenging market access environment in the United States.2017 Outlook: Celgene updated its guidance for 2017. The company anticipates earnings in the range of $7.30-$7.35 compared to the previous guidance of $7.25–$7.35 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $7.34 per share.  Net product sales are now projected at  $13 billion, compared to the earlier range of $13 billion – $13.4 billion.Pre-Market Trading: Shares are down in pre-market trading.Check back later for our full write up on this CELG earnings report later!Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3266,CELG,"Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report) announced that it will initiate a new phase IV study on H.P. Acthar Gel.This multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study will further assess the efficacy of Acthar as a therapy option in patients with symptomatic sarcoidosis. The study will evaluate Acthar as a later-line treatment option for sarcoidosis patients with persistent disease.The drug is already approved in the United States for this indication.  The company is conducting the study to determine which class of patients will benefit the most from an alternative treatment like Acthar.Acthar became part of the company’s portfolio following the Questcor acquisition and is currently approved for 19 indications. Mallinckrodt is working on boosting Acthar sales in the approved indications including rheumatology and pulmonology as well as underserved patient populations. The company intends to invest in research and development activities for developing Acthar for indications like lupus, proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and diabetic nephropathy.Performance of the drug has been impressive so far, propelled by solid demand for rheumatology, pulmonology, ophthalmology and nephrology, and expanded access in more recently promoted indications such as lupus and sarcoidosis, as well as mature indications such as infantile spasms and nephrotic syndrome.Mallinckrodt’s stock price has declined 28.0% year to date, compared with the industry’s  fall of 20.7%.We note that Mallinckrodt is currently focused on reshaping its product portfolio through strategic acquisitions and non-core asset divestitures to transform the portfolio and become a high-performing specialty pharmaceutical company. The company recently acquired privately-held InfaCare Pharmaceutical Corp. This specialty pharmaceutical company focuses on the development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceuticals for neo-natal and pediatric patients.The company’s generic segment continues to face weakness as various product categories are witnessing stiff competition, which is hurting both volumes and prices. The company expects double-digit declines in revenues from this segment. In addition, continued expected weakness in this segment will adversely impact gross profit margins also.The company sold its Nuclear Imaging business due to persistent challenges. The company also sold its Intrathecal Therapy business to focus on key areas. While Acthar Gel sales continue to be strong on the back of increased formulary positions and access for appropriate patients in both the commercial and public environments, sales of Therakos are expected to decline.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMallinckrodt currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACAD  -  Free Report), Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) and Aduro Biotech, Inc. (ADRO  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.ACADIA’s loss per share estimates have narrowed from $2.82 to $2.57 for 2017 and from $2.07 to $1.90 for 2018 over the last 60 days. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.97%.Celgene’s earnings estimates for both 2017 and 2018 have inched up by 0.7% over the past 90 days. The stock has rallied 20.7% year to date, outperforming the industry.Aduro Biotech’s loss per share estimates narrowed from $1.36 to $1.29 for 2017 over the last 30 days. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the four trailing quarters with an average of 2.53%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

3267,CELG,"Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner UCB SA  announced that the FDA has issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the biologics license application (BLA) for Evenity (romosozumab). Amgen is looking to get Evenity approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.The original BLA included data from the pivotal FRAME study.However, the FDA now requires safety and efficacy data from the other two pivotal phase III studies - ARCH and BRIDGE - to be included in the application. The agency has asked for a resubmission of the BLA, which will be considered as an extension of the current review.We remind investors that in May, Amgen had presented data from ARCH fracture study of romosozumab compared to Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax (alendronate) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Data from the study showed that Evenity/romosozumab led to a statistically significant superior fracture risk reduction than Fosamax (alendronate), which is the current standard of care in osteoporosis. However, a cardiovascular side effect was observed in the study.The company then said that the safety data from the ARCH data will now be considered in the regulatory review as agreed with the FDA. Following the heart-related safety issue that emerged from the otherwise successful ARCH results, Amgen warned that it did not expect Evenity to be approved this year.The CRL, thus, does not come as a surprise.So far this year, Amgen’s shares are up 21.1%, better than the 9.0% increase registered by the Zacks categorized Biomed/Genetics industry.The FRAME study evaluated the effectiveness of Evenity in reducing the risk of new vertebral fractures over 12 months. It also compared the effectiveness of 12 months of Evenity administration, followed by another 12 months of Xgeva to placebo followed by Xgeva administration.The BRIDGE study evaluated Evenity in older men with osteoporosis and a history of fragility fracture or vertebral fracture. The study evaluated the effectiveness of Evenity in increasing bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and its effect on BMD at the femoral neck and total hip.The company is working along with the FDA and is in a process to re-submit the BLA with the requested data.In a separate press release, Amgen announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA and a variation to the marketing application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its myeloma drug, Kyprolis. The submission of the regulatory applications was done to expand the drug’s label to include overall survival (OS) data from phase III ENDEAVOR study.We remind investors that Kyprolis (twice weekly) is already approved for use in combination with dexamethasone or with Celgene Corporations’ (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) plus dexamethasone based on the primary analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) data from the ASPIRE study.The submissions include data from the pivotal ENDEAVOR study, which compared Kyprolis and J&J’s Velcade in combination with dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The data demonstrated that Kyprolis reduced the risk of death by 21% compared to Velcade and increased the median OS by 7.6 months (47.6 months vs. 40 months).Kyprolis is the first and only therapy to achieve superior OS in a head-to-head comparison with a current standard of care, Velcade.Last week, Amgen announced OS data from the ASPIRE study. Overall survival data from the study showed that patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma lived 7.9 months longer when treated with Kyprolis plus Revlimid and dexamethasone (KRd) compared to those treated with Revlimid and dexamethasone (Rd) (median OS of 48.3 months for KRd versus median OS of 40.4 months for Rd).).Kyprolis is also being evaluated in a couple of other studies for potential label expansion. Amgen is evaluating a weekly dosing regimen of Kyprolis in a phase III study (ARROW) in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients. Data is expected to be out in 2019.Amgen Inc.

3268,CELG,"The second-quarter earnings season is expected to be strong, with the S&P 500 index anticipated to see earnings growth of 5.6% and revenue growth of 4.5%, per the latest Earnings Trends. The stock market is also at record levels. However, the ongoing turmoil in Washington, geopolitical risks, Fed-related uncertainty, and lofty valuation could bring some difficulties for stocks this season (read: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Tap Q2 Earnings Growth).  While five of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to post double-digit earnings growth, six sectors would lag. Plus, the current earnings estimate is down from 7.9% projected at the start of the second quarter. Amid such volatility, investors should focus on ETFs with large allocations to stocks that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming release. This could result in a winning bet this earnings season.How to Find ETFs?Handpicking ETFs with a portfolio of stocks that are most likely to beat on earnings is no mean task. However, our proprietary methodology of finding out the Earnings ESP of stocks by calculating the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is a solid building block.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Betting on ETFs with the winning combination of stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) would lead to profits in investor portfolios. This is especially true as an earnings beat will definitely draw investors’ attention and propel the stock price and related ETFs higher. Let’s see how the ETFs have been selected with this combination of stocks.First, we ran our Zacks stock screener to find out the stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank. Then, we narrowed down the list by selecting the group of stocks with higher positive Earnings ESP. Accordingly, we chose three ETFs, which contain few stocks with higher chances of beating estimates in a particular industry (see: all the ETF Categories here).Our research shows that for the stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. As a result, this trio could be excellent for investors seeking sure profits this earnings season.PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Fund (PEJ  -  Free Report)This fund tracks the Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Intellidex Index and holds a small basket of 30 stocks. It is pretty well spread out across various securities as each holds less than 5.6% of total assets. About half of the stocks in the portfolio are expected to come up with an earnings beat, suggesting a solid upside for the ETF. In particular, American Airlines (AAL  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), McDonald's MCD and Time Warner , which are among the top five holdings and account for 5% share each,  have an Earnings ESP of +4.62%, +0.60%, +4.94%, and +2.56%, respectively. AAL and DAL have a Zacks Rank #1 while the other two have a Zacks Rank #2.From an industry look, restaurants and airlines take the largest share at 31% and 21% of PEJ, respectively, followed by hotels & leisure facilities (21%) and casinos & gaming (13%).

3269,CELG,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is in full swing with financial figures from 133 S&P 500 members or 26% of the index already out as of Jan 26, 2018 per the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these index members jumped 12.3% from the year-ago quarter, driven by 8.8% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 81.2% for the bottom line and 78.9% for the top line.On a positive note, the ongoing earnings phase seems to have begun well for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season with earnings beating estimates while sales slightly missing the same. A few other large pharma companies released their earnings results last week and the picture looks quite encouraging.The pharma bigwigs having reported last week are Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), which surpassed both earnings and sales estimates in the quarter under review. While Novartis raised its sales guidance for 2018, AbbVie increased its previously issued earnings expectations for the year.Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced a mixed performance in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations during the fourth quarter.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical reports as well as a continued robust performance of legacy products. Moreover, these impressive factors, along with regular acquisitions, are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018 as well.Also, per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 4.9% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 4.2% rise in earnings in the period under discussion.Two pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Jan 31. Let's see how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company delivered a positive surprise of 1.94% last quarter. Lilly’s earnings performance has been modest with earnings missing expectations in three of the last four quarters while beating the same in the remaining one, thus bringing the average beat to 1.68%.Our proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The combination of Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP as a solid Zacks Rank, and a positive Earnings ESP of +0.47% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the impending report. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.08 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We expect a sturdy uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo. This upside is likely to make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient in the fourth quarter. (Read More: Lilly to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)Vertex is slated to release fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes. The company’s track record has also been impressive so far. It delivered a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 32.67%. In third-quarter 2017, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 43.24%.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -4.00% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 58 cents per share. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Vertex’s cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs, Kalydeco & Orkambi, performed consistently in the first three quarters of 2017.

3270,CELG,"For investors seeking momentum, SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI  -  Free Report) is probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up around 59.5% from its 52-week low price of $61.44/share.But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:XBI in FocusThis fund offers exposure to the S&P Biotechnology Select Industry Index which represents the biotechnology sub-industry portion of the S&P Total Markets Index. Bioverativ, MiMedx Group and Juno Therapeutics are top three holdings of the fund. It charges 35 basis points in annual fees (see all Health Care ETFs here).Why the Move?Buyouts in the biotech space are in the spotlight currently. Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) buying Juno Therapeutics Inc  for $9 billion and Sanofi SA (ADR) (SNY  -  Free Report) buying Bioverativ Inc  for $11.6 billion recently are probably pushing the space higher. Plus, the tax reform entails biotech companies to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars stacked in the international economies. This extra cash may be used to buy back shares or pay out dividends in the coming days.More Gains Ahead?Currently, XBI has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook, suggesting that the outperformance could continue in the months ahead.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:BBC in FocusThis fund has a novel approach to biotechnology investing with exposure to companies that are in the clinical trial stage. It has a well-diversified portfolio of 74 stocks with key holdings in the hottest stock Juno Therapeutics  currently in the market. BBC charges 79 bps in fees per year from its investors (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Why the Move?The biotech segment of the broad equity market has been an area to watch lately given that the new tax legislation has enticed companies in this corner to bring offshore cash back home, leading to a wave of mergers and acquisitions. Additionally, the slower growth in mature drugs has compelled prominent biotechs to acquire smaller ones with promising pipelines. The latest catalyst is JUNO, which has agreed to be acquired by Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) for $87 per share in cash, or $9 billion.More Gains Ahead?Currently, BBC has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook, suggesting that the outperformance could continue in the months ahead.

3272,CELG,"Acquisitions once again remained in focus this week with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) rumored to be in talks with Juno  regarding a possible deal.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJuno Soars on Acquisition Rumors: Juno’s shares skyrocketed on reports that Celgene is interested in acquiring the immuno-oncology focused company. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the companies are in talks regarding a possible acquisition deal. If the Juno acquisition rumors turn out to be true, this will be the second acquisition announcement to be made by Celgene this year. Just last week, the company announced its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines, which is developing fedratinib for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.Celgene is under a lot of pressure to strengthen its pipeline and revenue stream - the company had a tough 2017 with issues like pipeline setbacks as well as the weak performance of Otezla weighing on the stock.However, it remains to be seen how much Celgene will be willing to shell out for Juno. Juno’s market cap as of Jan 16, 2018 was $5.2 billion. Juno’s shares have been on an upward trend following the $11.9 billion Gilead-Kite acquisition announcement last year in August. With Juno being focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, the company has long been considered a potential acquisition target. Over the last one year, Juno’s shares are up 139% compared to the 3.3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma. Although Juno suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), the company is now focusing on liso-cel, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. Juno expects to file for FDA approval of liso-cel for relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”) in the second half of 2018. With the immuno-oncology space remaining quite lucrative, Celgene may have to pay a hefty premium to finalize the deal. Juno and Celgene already have a collaboration deal in place.Concert Down on Patent Challenge Update: Concert Pharmaceuticals (CNCE  -  Free Report) suffered a major blow with its Post Grant Review (“PGR”) petition challenging the validity of U.S. Patent No. 9,662,335 being rejected by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Concert had filed the petition last year in July challenging the validity of the patent that has been assigned to Incyte Pharmaceuticals (INCY  -  Free Report). The concerned patent covers deuterated ruxolitinib analogs while Concert’s CTP-543 is a deuterium-modified version of ruxolitinib. Incyte markets ruxolitinib in the United States under the name Jakafi and has patents covering ruxolitinib that may be unexpired if and when Concert seeks marketing approval for CTP-543.Despite the setback, Concert said that it can always challenge the validity of the patent later in federal court. Moreover, the company said that the decision does not affect its plans to develop CTP-543 for alopecia areata. However, the company is now reassessing its plans for developing CTP-543 for additional indications.CTP-543 is a novel JAK inhibitor currently in phase II development for alopecia areata. The FDA recently granted fast track status to the candidate for this indication (Read more: Concert Pharmaceuticals Plunges on Patent Petition Setback).Vertex’s Orkambi Label Expanded in EU: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report) gained EU approval for the use of Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) in children with cystic fibrosis (“CF”) in the 6-11 years age group with two copies of the F508del mutation. About 3,400 children in Europe belong to this category. Approval was in-line with expectations considering the company had got a positive opinion from the European Union Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) for this indication in November 2017 (Read more: Vertex's Cystic Fibrosis Drug Ok'd for Pediatric Use in EU). Vertex is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Humira Biosimilar BLA Accepted by FDA: The FDA has accepted for review a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) submitted by Sandoz for its biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira (adalimumab). Humira is approved for a wide range of indications. At a recent healthcare conference, AbbVie said that global Humira sales crossed $18 billion in 2017 and should approach $21 billion in 2020. The company, which expects the drug to lose exclusivity in international markets in the fourth quarter of 2018, believes that sales erosion will be manageable.  We note that Sandoz is not the first to file for a biosimilar version of Humira. In fact, companies like Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim have already gained approval for their Humira biosimilars. Amgen, which entered into a global settlement and license agreement with AbbVie, expects to launch its Humira biosimilar in Europe in October 2018 and in the United States in January 2023. Meanwhile, AbbVie and Boehringer are engaged in patent litigation in the United States.Eiger Plunges on Pipeline Setback: Eiger suffered a major setback with its investigational treatment, ubenimex, for pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) failing to meet the primary endpoint in a mid-stage study. Based on this disappointing update, the company has decided to discontinue the development of ubenimex for PAH though it will continue to evaluate ubenimex for lymphedema. Ubenimex is in a mid-stage study for this indication with data expected in the second half of the year. The company’s shares were down 49.4% on the news.PerformanceMedical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index was up slightly over the last four trading sessions.

3273,CELG,"We expect Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Year to date, Bristol-Myers’ shares have increased 10.2% while the industry has recorded an increase of 20.5%.Bristol-Myers’ track record has been positive so far. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters and missed expectations in one. The average positive earnings surprise in the last four quarters is 7.99%. In the last reported quarter, Bristol-Myers came up with a positive surprise of 1.37%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayBristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo is expected to be the primary sales driver in the third quarter. The drug is already approved in multiple cancer indications. During this quarter, the FDA approved the drug for two additional indications – hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic colorectal cancer – in patients who have received prior treatment. Although, these label expansions are not expected to have much impact on the top line, these when combined with the two label expansions in the second quarter will certainly boost sales.Although the second quarter saw some stability in the second-line lung cancer setting, FDA’s approval of Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in May for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC will increase competition and may impact sales unfavorably. The Zacks Consensus Estimates indicates the drug sales to increase 31% from the year-ago quarter to $1.2 billion.In July, the FDA also approved the label expansion of Yervoy injection in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug this quarter is $323 million.Meanwhile, rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, received approval for treating psoriatic arthritis in the United States as well as in Europe in July. Moreover, in June, Bristol-Myers announced the availability of subcutaneous administration option for Orencia in patients with moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The label expansion and new administration option is expected to fuel growth of the drug. The drug, which registered growth of 10% in the previous quarter, is expected to generate sales of $635 million this quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.On the other hand, the decline in the Hepatitis C franchise is expected to continue due to intense competition from multiple drugs including Epclusa whose label was expanded to include HIV co-infection in August. Moreover, the HIV business continues to face competitive pressure. Recent launches by other companies in the same space are expected to further impact the Sustiva franchise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hepatitis C franchise sales is pegged at $108 million this quarter, down 71.5% from year ago quarter.The company is developing its key drug, Opdivo as monotherapy as well as combination therapy for several tumor types in multiple studies, with two label expansion applications under review in the United States. We expect investor focus on updates related to Opdivo in the conference call. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that Bristol-Myers is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (earnings of 77 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (earnings of 76 cents), stands at +0.79%. This is a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Bristol-Myers currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may also want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Clovis Oncology, Inc.

3274,CELG,"The year 2017 has been better than expected for the biotech sector. The NASDAQ Biotechnology index was up 18.7% in 2017. While drug pricing issue, competition and a slowdown in growth of key drugs are expected to remain a hangover in 2018 as well, approval of new drugs and strategic acquisitions by several big wigs in 2017 are likely to boost investors’ sentiments. Thus 2018 needless to say, holds promise for generating stellar returns.The slowdown in mature products compelled bigwigs like Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) to undertake acquisitions to bolster pipelines. Gilead acquired erstwhile Kite Pharma and added Yescarta to its kitty. The company also inked an agreement to acquire Cell Design Labs. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Recently, Celgene, Inc. (CELG  -  Free Report) inked a deal to acquire Impact Biomedicines for an upfront amount of $1.1 billion. The acquisition will add a late-stage candidate, fedratinib, a highly selective JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.  The candidate is being developed for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Celgene was on the look-out of new deals and acquisitions given a lacklustre 2017, having suffered a few pipeline setbacks and weakness in Otezla sales. Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank.Acquisitions and mergers will keep investors focused in the space in 2018.  In addition, new drug approvals and label expansion of existing drugs will boost the top line of prominent biotech companies.Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) looks poised for growth with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio. Amgen’s new drugs — Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar — are performing well. The company recently won the FDA approval for the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) of Xvega to expand the drug’s label for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3.Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) is another biotech which looks poised for growth in 2018. The recent FDA approval of the label expansion of lead drug Cabometyx for the treatment previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma is expected to drive growth. The drug has performed impressively since approval in 2016. Exelixis currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well and the FDA approval of the drug for generalized myasthenia gravis will further boost sales. Among new products, while Strensiq is gaining momentum, the company redefined its strategy for Kanuma.  Alexion carries a Zacks Rank #3.Investors should also keep an eye on key upcoming PDUFA dates. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) is looking to expand label for its newly approved drug Dupixent. The drug is already approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The company is also evaluating the drug for treating asthma in adults (LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study).  sBLA for the same is expected to be filed shortly. Regeneron is working on expanding lead ophthalmology drug Eylea label into additional indications. The FDA has accepted for review the company's sBLA for the label expansion of Eylea Injection. The company is seeking approval a for a 12-week dosing interval of Eylea Injection in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) based on physician's assessment. The action date set by the FDA is Aug 11, 2018. Regeneron carries a Zacks Rank #3.Another big biotech, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) is taking measures to strengthen its already dominant position in the cystic fibrosis market (CF). Vertex has two CF drugs — Kalydeco & Orkambi — in its portfolio with blockbuster potential.  The company has developed another CF corrector tezacaftor (VX-661) — in combination with ivacaftor.  Regulatory applications are under review in the United States (PDUFA Date: Feb 28, 2018) and the EU.  A potential approval would further bolster demand.  Vertex currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % Return   Medical - Biomedical and Genetics Industry 5YR % ReturnConclusion While the threat of biosimilars loom large on key drugs of most companies, we expect investors to remain focussed on this dynamic sector eying new drug approvals and important data read-outs.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3275,CELG,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its regulatory application in the United States seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). The FDA is expected to give its decision on May 28 next year.Prolia is presently marketed in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.The supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) was submitted in July this year. The sBLA was based on a phase III study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Prolia compared with risedronate in patients receiving glucocorticoid medications.GIOP is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. This serious condition is presently treated with glucocorticoid treatment, which increases fracture risk within the first three months of beginning treatment. Prolia, if approved for the treatment of GIOP, can cater to an expanded patient population and drive sales higher.Prolia is a key revenue generator for Amgen and is witnessing market share gains in both the United States and international markets. In the first half of 2017, the drug generated sales of $930 million, up 17% year over year.Amgen’s shares have rallied 26.9% this year so far, better than the industry’s growth of 14.1% so far this year.Currently, Amgen holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3276,CELG,"Israel-based generic drug maker, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report), saw its shares decline 9.4% last week with the company suffering a fresh setback in the form of FDA approval of a generic version of the company’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone (multiple sclerosis). Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for its generic version of the 40 mg (thrice weekly) dosage as well as the once-daily 20 mg formulation of Copaxone. With Mylan being among the first applicants to challenge the 40 mg patent, the company could enjoy 180 days of exclusivity. Mylan has launched both products. Mylan also gained approval for the 40 mg dose in the EU.The FDA approval of generic Copaxone is a major blow for Teva which is currently facing a whole lot of challenges. Teva issued a statement saying that the launch of the 40 mg formulation before the final resolution of pending patent infringement lawsuits with Mylan will be treated as an “at-risk” launch – this means Mylan would have to pay significant damages if the court upholds the patents protecting the drug.Copaxone brought in total sales of $1.99 billion in the first half of 2017. At the end of the second quarter of 2017, Copaxone 40 mg accounted for more than 85% of total Copaxone prescriptions in the United States.The entry of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation (Sandoz and Momenta have been on the market for quite a while with Glatopa, a generic version of the 20 mg dose) is expected to cut Teva’s 4Q earnings by at least 25 cents per share. Additional details should be out when the company announces third quarter results on November 2. The entry of generic Copaxone just adds to the existing list of problems being faced by Teva.Generic pricing erosion remains a huge issue for generic companies like Teva. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.Consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs leading to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year. All these headwinds will persist for the U.S. Generics unit into the near future, resulting in lower revenue and profit in this segment in 2018 and potentially 2019.Meanwhile, the company said that it does not expect any earnings contribution from its businesses in Venezuela given the significant devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. Teva also cut its dividend by 75%.Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.The company has been working on addressing these issues and recently announced the appointment of a new CEO (Read more: Why Did Teva Pharmaceuticals Stock Soar Today?). Teva has also made significant progress in the divestment of non-core businesses. However, the entry of Copaxone 40 mg is a major setback for the company and it could well be a while before Teva is able to get back on track.Teva is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. The company has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.9% downward over the last 7 days while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has been revised 5.1% downward over the last 7 days. Teva has lost 56% of its value year to date versus the 20.5% decline of its industry.While Teva deals with these challenges, here is a look at five drug companies that sport a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Celgene is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. The company has several blockbuster products in its portfolio including Revlimid, Pomalyst, and Otezla. Celgene has a rich and promising pipeline as well with key data readouts lined up for the next two years.Celgene, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has gained 20.3% year to date, outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. The company also has a VGM Score of A. The VGM Score is a useful tool that allows investors to gain an insight into a stock’s strengths and weaknesses.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pfizer is focused on the development and commercialization of a wide range of medicines and vaccines as well consumer health care products. During the first half of the year, the company paid $8.9 billion in dividends and share buybacks to its shareholders including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program.Pfizer, which expects 2017 revenues to be affected by about $2.5 billion due to loss of exclusivities (LOEs), is working on bringing new products to market to make up for lost sales. The company has 15 potential blockbusters lined up for the next 5 years with about half of these potentially by 2020. Focus also remains on growing new products like Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Meanwhile, the impact of LOEs should continue declining in the coming years (about $2 billion in 2018 as well as 2019, $1 billion - $2 billion in 2020; $1 billion in 2021, and $0.5 billion or less from 2022 to 2025).Pfizer, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, carries a VGM Score of B.Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report): Amgen, one of the most well-known names in the biotech industry, has a presence in the oncology/hematology, inflammation, nephrology, bone health and cardiovascular disease markets. Key products include Enbrel, Neulasta, Aranesp, Prolia, Xgeva, Epogen, Kyprolis, Repatha, and Blincyto among others. Most of these products are either blockbusters or have blockbuster potential. Amgen has a deep pipeline with the company working on bringing new products to market to combat the impact of potential biosimilar competition for mature products in its franchise. The company has been returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.Amgen is also a Zacks Rank #2 stock with a VGM Score of B. The stock has gained 27.1% year to date, outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertex is a key player in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market. The company holds a strong position in this market with two marketed products – Orkambi and Kalydeco. Vertex is working on expanding its CF portfolio and is currently seeking both FDA and EMA approval for a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out by Feb 28, 2018.Vertex, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 110.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report): Ligand’s business model is based on developing or acquiring royalty revenue generating assets and coupling them with a lean corporate cost structure. The company is focused on the development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets. Ligand’s Captisol formulation technology has allowed it to enter into several licensing deals and generate royalties. The company’s partners include big names like Amgen and Novartis among others. Ligand also has licensing deals based on its OmniAb technology.Ligand’s recent decision to acquire Crystal Bioscience, a leader in avian genetics and the generation of fully-human therapeutic antibodies, is expected to boost the company’s 2018 revenues by at least $5 million and earnings by at least 9 cents per share.Ligand, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 39.4% year to date, substantially outperforming the 14.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3277,CELG,"Biotech stocks have been moving north of late, largely driven by a spate of deal news. Such deals lend financial stability to businesses and maximize shareholders’ wealth. Further, more deals are expected to be signed in the biotech space, now that the tax reform bill allows companies to repatriate cash pilling up overseas.Corporate taxes, in the meantime, will be trimmed and price gouging fears have ebbed, which bode well for biotech companies. Banking on such positives, investing in sound biotech stocks seems judicious.Biotech ETFs Hit Record High on Deal NewsThe biotech sector scaled record highs on Jan 22 following a couple of multi-dollar deals. After all, a flurry of mergers in any sector is always encouraging. Such mergers give control over the markets, increase value and reduce costs. Needless to say, these also lead to economy of scale through sharing of resources, reduced risks owing to usage of innovative techniques as well as tax advantage.The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) rose 3.8%, the biggest one-day percentage gain since June 2017. The fund registered a gain of 9% so far this year, well above the 5.4% rise of the S&P 500. For quite some time, the fund has remained popular among investors and has seen inflows of $216.2 million on a year-to-date basis. On the other hand, the fund has witnessed a meager outflow of $35.9 million during the same period, per FactSet. Similarly, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) went up 2.6% to $114.9, the highest since September 2015. The fund also posted its biggest one-day percentage gain since last August.The rise followed Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) acquisition of Bioverativ Inc.  for $11.6 billion in order to establish its authority in the specialty care space. The French company insisted on paying $105 in cash for each share purchased. This represents a whopping 64% premium to Bioverativ’s closing price on Jan 19, according to Sanofi.  Even though Sanofi’s shares took a beating, the company expects the deal to boost earnings in 2018 and help it achieve return on invested capital in just about three years. Shares of Bioverativ, in the meantime, jumped 61.9% to close at $103.79. In fact, the company saw its share price hit an intraday high of $104.30 (read more: Sanofi to Acquire Haemophilia Focused Bioverativ, Stock Dips).Another biotech buyout hogging the limelight is that of Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  and Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report). The latter agreed to buy Juno Therapeutics for $9 billion, or $87 a cash. This deal will help Celgene access the Seattle-based firm’s CAR-T cancer drug pipeline. Celgene added that Juno's research capabilities will strengthen the company’s leadership in hematology and add new drivers for growth in the long run. The deal is expected to add 50 cents per share to Celgene’s adjusted earnings this year. Shares of both Celgene and Juno Therapeutics were up 0.3% and 26.8%, respectively (read more: Juno Hits 52-Week High on Celgene's Rumored Buyout Interest).Mergers to Gain Momentum, Tax Plan to Boost ProfitsCourtesy of the new tax overhaul policy, biotech firms are able to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars stranded overseas and pay only 8% to 15.5% tax, instead of the current 35%. This extra cash can be used for merger and acquisition activities. Biotech firms have around $500 billion in cash to invest in merger and acquisitions, while Jay Rao, a medical doctor and money manager at Balyasny Asset Management had said that “M&A and consolidation are inevitable” in the biotech sector.President Trump’s business tax plan should also benefit biotech companies. The headline-grabbing corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed until 2019. The lower tax burden is expected to boost profits for large biotech companies (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).5 Best Biotech Stocks to Buy NowThe biotech sector has come alive, courtesy of a slew of deals. Notably, such deals can further get a boost from the new U.S. tax reform. Inventors have also, lately, started to feel that drug pricing issues won’t be as damaging as feared. Earlier, fears that price control could be put in place had deterred investors from investing in biotech.Given the positives, it seems prudent to invest in five solid biotech firms. Such stocks essentially have strong fundamentals, thus being great investment options. Also, these companies flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ANTH  -  Free Report) focuses on the development and commercialization of medicines for patients with unmet medical needs. The biopharmaceutical company has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings surged more than 100% over the last 90 days.

3278,CELG,"We have completed just three weeks in 2018 and the biotech sector is already seeing a significant pickup in merger and acquisition (M&A) deals. The year started off with Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) announcing its intention to acquire Impact Biomedicines.Soon thereafter, Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx. Novo Nordisk had initially proposed to acquire Ablynx for €26.75 per share in cash. However, the company came back with a revised offer when Ablynx rejected the first proposal. Novo Nordisk’s latest offer includes an upfront cash payment of €28 per share plus a contingent value right (“CVR”) worth up to €2.50 per share (total equity valuation of approximately €2.6 billion). This offer, too, has been rejected by Ablynx with the company’s Board announcing that the proposal fundamentally undervalues Ablynx and its growth prospects.Last week, Celgene was once again in the news on rumors that it is looking to acquire immuno-oncology focused Juno Therapeutics . Yesterday, the rumors were confirmed with the company saying that it will be acquiring Juno for approximately $9 billion. Another acquisition announcement was made yesterday – French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) said that it will be buying biopharma company Bioverativ for $11.6 billion. While Celgene is looking to strengthen its presence in the cancer space with the Impact and Juno acquisitions, Sanofi is looking to expand its presence in specialty care and strengthen its leadership in rare diseases through the Bioverativ acquisition.More M&A Deals to Follow?With these announcements being made, expectations are pretty high for more such deals in 2018. In fact, last week Acorda Therapeutics’s shares were up on rumors that Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) is interested in acquiring the company.Factors like growing biosimilar competition, slowdown in growth of legacy products, major pipeline setbacks, looming patent expiries, pricing challenges and growing competition have forced big players to seek deals and acquisitions to grow their pipelines and boost their revenue stream.With tax reform expected to lead to an increase in cash repatriation, 2018 seems set for more M&A announcements. Companies like Pfizer, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Biogen, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Gilead are expected to be on the lookout for suitable deals this year. At the end of the third quarter of 2017, Gilead (which had acquired Kite for approximately $11.9 billion in 2017) had a cash and equivalents balance of $41.4 billion including $32.4 billion of overseas cash. Amgen’s cash balance was also $41.4 billion as of Sep 30, 2017 with about $38.9 billion being held overseas. Meanwhile, Merck exited the third quarter of 2017 with cash and equivalents worth $23.4 billion of which about 80%-90% is held overseas. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s overseas cash holdings were approximately $9.4 billion at the end of the third quarter. Biogen’s overseas cash balance was approximately $4.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2017. While some of this cash is likely to be used for share buybacks and dividend payments, these companies are also expected to use the funds for acquisition deals.  Most of these companies are on the lookout for assets and technologies that are potentially transformational and/or address unmet needs. Immuno-oncology is currently very much in demand though companies are also focusing on rare disease and orphan disease areas. While valuations look high for cancer-focused companies especially ones involved in immuno-oncology, valuations appear to be more reasonable for specialty pharma companies and companies that are focused on central nervous system diseases and other such areas.Although many of the large-cap players have expressed an interest in pursuing M&A deals, they have also pointed out that the deals should make sense from a financial perspective. High valuations and bidding wars could keep some of the key players on the sidelines.Companies like AveXis, bluebird, BioMarin, Puma Biotechnology, Incyte, and Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) are often considered acquisition targets. Exelixis is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3279,CELG,"2017 was an eventful year for pharma and biotech stocks. Although the industry faced challenges like drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena, fewer-than-expected acquisition deals and major pipeline setbacks, there were some positive developments as well. There was a significant surge in FDA approvals, investors appeared more comfortable with the drug pricing controversy and innovation won the day with the FDA granting approval to gene therapies for cancer as well as a rare form of blindness. Tax reforms are also expected to work in the sector’s favor with mergers and acquisitions (M&As) expected to pick up in the coming quarters.Keeping this in mind, here is a look at key takeaways from presentations made by four major pharma and biotech stocks at the annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference, the largest and most informative healthcare investment symposium in the industry.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report): Pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer, expects 2018 to be a rich data delivery year. The company’s focus is on five therapeutic areas including oncology, inflammation & immunology, vaccines and rare disease & internal medicines. Within the immuno-oncology portfolio, focus remains mainly on drug combinations of Bavencio with a variety of Pfizer-targeted agents.During the first half of the year, the company should present late-stage data on Bavencio (second-line non-small cell lung cancer) and Vyndaqel (cardiomyopathy) while regulatory submissions are expected for Xtandi (non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer) and PARP inhibitor, talazoparib (breast cancer). The second half of the year will see the company presenting phase III data on rivipansel (sickle cell) and tanezumab (pain). The company also has a couple of PDUFA dates in 2018 – Xeljanz for ulcerative colitis (its first indication outside rheumatology) and lorlatinib (second-line non-small cell lung cancer).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The company’s shares are up 11.1% over the last one year compared to the 18.4% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report): Biotech company, Celgene, announced its preliminary results as well as 2018 outlook at the healthcare conference. Celgene will also be presenting a significant amount of data this year including on Revlimid + Rituxan (relapsed and/or refractory follicular lymphoma) and Otezla for scalp psoriasis. Several study initiations are also expected this year. Moreover, the company expects to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for Revlimid in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (“NDMM”), a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for fedratinib in myelofibrosis and an sNDA for Otezla in Behçet's disease. Meanwhile, FDA decisions are expected this year for ozanimod (relapsing multiple sclerosis - RMS) and a once-daily formulation of Otezla. The company said it will continue to invest in business development.Celgene is a Zacks Rank #3 stock – the company’s shares are down 10.1% over the last one year compared to the 0.9% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report): Bristol-Myers’s pipeline represents several opportunities for long-term growth. The company provided an update on its blockbuster drug, Opdivo, which is expected to drive near- and mid-term growth. Non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”), hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer are some areas that represent commercial potential in excess of $1 billion each. These are disease areas with high prevalence, high unmet medical need and low survival rates. Bristol-Myers has several data-readouts on Opdivo planned for 2018 and 2019. The company’s immuno-oncology portfolio has several early-stage candidates and late-stage assets like relatlimab (anti-LAG3) and BMS-986205 (BMS-IDO). The company said that business development remains an important priority with the focus being on deals that make sense from a financial perspective and where the assets and technologies are strategically aligned to its priorities and are potentially transformational.  Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The company’s shares are up 9.1% over the last one year.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report): For Merck too, business development remains a key priority. The company said that it is looking at opportunities through licensing deals and bolt-on acquisitions to add drugs/technology that address unmet medical needs. While Merck will provide its 2018 outlook in February, the company said that headwinds remain in the form of competitive pressure for drugs like Zostavax and Zepatier while Zetia and Vytorin will still feel the impact of generic competition. However, Keytruda represents significant growth opportunity with the drug being in several studies for label expansion and combination use. Moreover, the company’s pipeline of oncology assets, novel vaccines, select hospital and specialty products also provide scope for long-term growth.Merck is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company’s shares are down 7% over the last one year.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3280,CELG,"Shares of Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) have soared 60.7% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry's increase of 25.1%.Let’s analyze the factors that led to this rally.  The FDA approval of the Agios’ only marketed drug Idhifa (enasidenib) last year and the company’s rapid progress on a robust pipeline in the past year accompanied with some study initiations and positive readouts have driven its share price consistently.In August 2017, the FDA approved Idhifa for treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. The approval offered a huge boost to the company given the immense commercial potential in the target market. Moreover, Idhifa provides a first-ever treatment, alternative to patients living with the aforementioned indication in the United States. Notably, Idhifa also enjoys an Orphan Drug status in the EU for treatment of AML.Agios’ progress with the pipeline has been quite impressive. The company has some interesting candidates in its portfolio including an IDH1 mutant inhibitor AG-120 (ivosidenib) and a pan-IDH mutant inhibitor AG-881.In June 2017, Agios presented positive data from the dose-escalation and expansion cohorts of the phase I study, evaluating single agent ivosidenib in mutant-positive cholangiocarcinoma at the ASCO.Ivosidenib is also being evaluated in a phase I expansion cohort for treatment of patients with IDH1m R/R AML. Data from the study demonstrated durable responses which allowed the company to submit a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for ivosidenib late in December.During the same month, the company also announced positive results from a phase I study assessing ivosidenib in combination with standard induction chemotherapy or Celgene's (CELG  -  Free Report) Vidaza (Azacitadine) for treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients, not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.Presently, a phase III AGILE study examining ivosidenib in combination with Vidaza is also underway for the given indication.Apart from ivosidenib, Agios is conducting phase I trials on AG-881 for treatment of patients with advanced IDH1 or IDH2 mutant-positive solid tumors. Earlier in October, the company announced positive data from the study at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics.Notably, the company also plans to initiate a perioperative window study to analyze ivosidenib and AG-881 in low grade glioma for investigating the effects on brain tumor tissue in the first half of 2018.The company has another interesting candidate in its portfolio. Its lead rare genetic diseases candidate, AG-348, is under evaluation in a phase II study on adult, transfusion-independent patients with Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. Agios reported positive data from the program in June 2017. The FDA granted a fast track designation to the candidate for the given indication. As the RGD market is still untapped, newer therapies in this area hold huge potential.Successful development and commercialization of these investigational candidates should boost the company’s top line going forward considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price | Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Quote Zacks Rank and Key PicsAgios carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3281,CELG,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) has one of the most diverse revenue streams in the industry within the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for almost half of its revenues. The company has several multi-million dollar drugs covering a broad range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism; immunology; oncology; pulmonary hypertension; and infectious diseases/vaccines. However, several products in this segment are facing generic competition.J&J’s shares have gained 28.7% in the past year, outperforming the 23.3% increase witnessed by the industry it belongs to.J&J’s domestic Pharma segment sales decelerated in the first half of 2017.  However, sales growth accelerated in the third quarter and we are likely to see, a continuation of the positive trend in the fourth quarter and probably in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Pharmaceutical segment is $9.61 billion. Last quarter, segment sales beat the consensus estimate.We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech, Actelion which J&J bought in June, will support the top line. The Pharma segment will also continue to benefit from easier comps in the second half of 2017 compared with the first. Continued share gains are likely to drive sales of Imbruvica (cancer indications) and Stelara (psoriasis). Strong adoption for the newer indication of Crohn's disease is expected to contribute to Stelara growth. Also, strong adoption in outside U.S. markets and accelerated adoption in the United States across all lines of therapy are likely to drive sales of multiple myeloma product, Darzalex. These positives will offset the loss of sales of some drugs like Invokana due to higher managed care discounting.J&J also gained FDA approval for several line extensions in  the second and third quarters of 2017 —  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. The line extensions can expand the eligible patient population of these drugs and drive their sales in the fourth quarter.Two new drugs were approved last year. These include Tremfya (guselkumab) in the United States (July) as well as in the EU (November) for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States (November). Juluca is under review in the EU.Regarding Tremfya, J&J said on the third-quarter conference call that it has been well received by physicians and patients. The drug is likely to contribute to sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter. We expect an update on the commercialization plans of Juluca on the fourth quarter conference call.However, biosimilar competition is expected to hurt sales of key arthritis drug, Remicade outside the United States. Please note that J&J markets Remicade in partnership with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report).Overall, strong performance of the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from acquisitions like Actelion and Abbott Medical Optics should pull up the top line in the quarter. Meanwhile, higher investments for product launches will continue to hurt profits as had been the case in the third quarter.

3282,CELG,"Shares of Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  hit a new 52-week high of $70 on Jan 17 and eventually closed at $69.25. The shares of the company hit the new high on reports that the company is being acquired by Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report). Juno already has an agreement with Celgene for the global development and commercialization of immunotherapies. A potential acquisition of Juno, would help Celgene build and diversify its drug pipeline while building up future revenue streams.Shares of Juno have gained 240.6% in the past year while the industry registered an increase of 2.8%.Juno is developing CAR-T therapies and the same has remained in investor focus in 2017, courtesy of immense potential. CAR-T space is expected to be revolutionary in treatments for cancer. Therefore, the company has been in newsever since the CAR-T cancer therapy designer, Kite Pharma was acquired by the Biotech giant Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). In fact there were rumors of Juno’s potential acquisition by Gilead or even their biggest partner Celgene.The FDA also approved Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah, the first CAR-T therapy followed by yet another CAR-T approval of Kite Pharma’s Yescarta in the past one year. Juno has been another player in the market developing the therapy.Juno’s most advanced pipeline candidates -- JCAR017 and JCAR014 -- use CAR T-cell technology to target CD19.JCAR017 is presently undergoing a phase I pivotal TRANSCEND study for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) including those with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma grade 3B or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Juno reported promising additional data from the pivotal study including patients with DLBCL.in December 2017, The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL by the end of 2018 with biologics license application (BLA) expected to be filed in the second half of the same year.  In the third quarter 2017 conference call, Juno and Celgene also initiated a phase Ib PLATFORM study, evaluating the combination of JCAR017 with AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab), for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) NHL.Juno Therapeutics, Inc.

3283,CELG,"Interest in the CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cells) space continues to build up with the FDA giving its nod to the second CAR-T therapy last week. Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a cell-based gene therapy, gained approval for the treatment of adult patients with certain types of large B-cell lymphoma who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment. This makes Yescarta the second gene therapy to gain FDA approval, the first being Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah. Kymriah was approved in late August 2017 for certain pediatric and young adult patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”).How Does CAR-T Cell Therapy Work?CAR-T falls under the ambit of cellular immunotherapy which involves using a patient’s own immune cells to attack and get rid of harmful disease cells in the body.The CAR-T approach involves the collection of a patient’s T cells, their genetic modification outside the body, the incorporation of specific receptors which target cancer cells and finally, the re-infusion of the modified T cells back into the patient.There is a lot of enthusiasm for CAR-T as studies have shown that it can help achieve durable complete responses in some leukemias and lymphomas, including in patients who have suffered multiple relapses. However, CAR-T comes with its own set of challenges including a high level of R&D investment as well as safety issues like serious immune toxicity (“CRS”) or neurotoxicity. In fact, both Kymriah and Yescarta have boxed warnings in their labels for CRS and neurologic toxicities. These treatments will also not come cheap. While Novartis has set a price of $475,000 for Kymriah, the list price for Gilead’s Yescarta is $373,000.The FDA’s StanceWith the FDA granting back-to-back approvals to two CAR-T treatments, it looks like the regulatory environment might well be encouraging for gene cell therapy candidates.  In fact, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that the approval of Yescarta shows the continued momentum in this promising new area of medicine. The agency intends to release a comprehensive policy on how it plans to support the development of cell-based regenerative medicine.CAR-T Stocks in FocusGiven the increased focus on this corner of the immuno-oncology market and the huge commercial potential for approved treatments in this market, here is a look at 3 companies that are working on CAR-T cell treatments.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. : Biopharmaceutical company, Juno, is focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma.Although the company suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), Juno is now focusing on JCAR017, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. JCAR017 is currently in a registrational study for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (""NHL""). The company also has a strong partner in Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report).Juno stock has gained 131.9% year to date, substantially outperforming the 10.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report): bluebird is another clinical-stage company working on developing gene therapies for serious genetic diseases and T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. The company’s anti-BCMA CAR T therapy, bb21217, is being evaluated for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. bb21217 as well as bb2121 are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.bluebird stock has gained 131% year to date, substantially outperforming the 10.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (ZIOP  -  Free Report): Biotech company ZIOPHARM uses innovative gene expression, control and cell technologies to provide safe, effective and scalable cell- and viral-based therapies for cancer and graft-versus-host-disease. ZIOPHARM’s immune-oncology platform includes CAR-T as well as other adoptive cell-based approaches.While announcing second quarter results, the company had said that within its CAR+ T programs, it is continuing with a phase I second generation study of CD19 specific CAR+ T for lymphoid malignancies and expects to move third generation CD19 with mbIL15 towards an early-stage study evaluating point-of-care. Plans are also on to commence a phase I study with CD33-specific CAR+ T for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) this year. ZIOPHARM’s shares are up 0.9% so far in 2017.Juno, bluebird and ZIOPHARM are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In addition to the above three, companies like Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (BLCM  -  Free Report) and Cellectis also have a presence in this area. However, Cellectis, a French  biopharmaceutical company focused on developing immunotherapies based on gene-edited allogeneic CAR T-cells (UCART), has run into a roadblock with the FDA placing a clinical hold on a couple of early-stage studies being conducted on UCART123. The hold came into place after the company reported a death in one of the studies.Going forward, we expect investor focus to remain in this corner of the immuno-oncology market. In addition to tracking the performance of Kymriah and Yescarta, we believe more deals will be announced in the cell therapy space.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3284,CELG,"Shares of Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  have soared 151.5% this year so far, massively outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.5%. Here we analyze the factors that led to the rally.The CAR-T therapy space has remained in investor focus in 2017, courtesy of immense potential. Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma.Juno’s most advanced pipeline candidates-JCAR017 and JCAR014, use CAR T-cell technology to target CD19 . The company’s shares have seen an upward trend in 2017 for this reason.  JCAR017 is presently undergoing a phase I pivotal TRANSCEND study for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) including those with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma grade 3B or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Juno reported promising additional data from the pivotal study including patients with DLBCL. The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL by the end of 2018 with biologics license application (BLA) expected to be filed in the second half of the same year.  Recently, Juno and Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) also initiated a phase Ib PLATFORM study, evaluating the combination of JCAR017 with AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Imfinzi (durvalumab), for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) NHL.Additionally, both Juno and Celgene announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to JCAR017, for the treatment of r/r aggressive large B-cell NHL including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Primary Mediastinal B-cell Lymphoma (PMBCL). Further, the candidate was granted Priority Medicines (PRIME) eligibility for r/r DLBCL by the European Medicines Agency.We are positive on Juno's 10-year deal with Celgene for the global development and commercialization of immunotherapies. The collaboration will see the companies leveraging T cell therapeutic strategies to develop treatments for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases. Its initial focus will be on CAR-T and T cell receptor technologies. In fact, this deal is a major positive for Juno, given a strong partner in the form of Celgene.Juno is also looking to develop treatments targeting cancer-associated proteins other than CD19. Over the next five years, the company and its collaborators intend to advance several additional candidates into clinical testing with a significant focus on solid tumors, which are a major cause of cancer-related deaths in the developed world. Solid tumor pipeline candidates against four different targets include — JCAR024, which is in phase I in patients with ROR-1 expressing cancers, JCAR020 in phase I for ovarian cancer, JCAR023 in phase I for patients with refractory or recurrent pediatric neuroblastoma, JTCR016 in phase I/II for patients with high risk or relapsed AML, mesothelioma, and chronic myeloid leukemia in patients who have received an allogeneic HSCT, and it is also in phase I for advanced NSCLC patients and JCAR018 in phase I for CD22-positive r/r ALL or r/r NHL.Juno Therapeutics, Inc.

3285,CELG,"Shares of Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) have declined 9.5% in 2017 as against the industry’s gain of 5.2%.  Celgene suffered a series of setbacks over the last few months. The company suffered a setback last week when a late stage study on its lead cancer drug Revlimid in combination with Roche Holdings’ (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan failed.The study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared with the standard of care featuring Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-VN CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance for previously untreated follicular lymphoma.However, the R2 treatment arm could not achieve superiority in the co-primary endpoints of complete response or unconfirmed complete response CR/CRu) at 120 weeks and in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) observed during the pre-planned analysis. None of the arms proved superior for either of the co-primary endpoints. Meanwhile, an additional analysis of the trial is underway.Celgene’s key growth engine is Revlimid. In 2016, the drug’s worldwide sales increased 20% to $7.0 billion and contributed almost 62.1% of the total revenues. Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma.The failure of the study is disappointing. The drug’s label expansion would have boosted its sales potential. The company had expected lymphoma to increase Revlimid’s growth prospects by 2020 and beyond.The company's portfolio also includes Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane, Otezla, Istodax, Vidaza and Thalomid/Thalidomide. However, Abraxane sales are under pressure due to a highly competitive U.S. market for lung and breast cancer therapy. In this scenario, dependence on Revlimid has its inherent risks.In addition, in October 2017, the company announced a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) were discontinued following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis.Meanwhile, the deep yet persistently slow growth of the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis markets, especially during the entire third quarter, has led to a weak performance of Otezla. Consequently, the company also reduced its annual guidance. The challenging market conditions were driven by an increasingly restrictive PBM formulary control.These factors will remain a hangover on the company’s shares in 2018 as well.On a positive note, in August 2017, the company obtained an FDA approval for Idhifa for treatment of relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The drug was developed in partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AGIO  -  Free Report). We expect Celgene to look out for strategic acquisitions on the same note as bigwigs like Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) to aid the top line.Zacks RankCelgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3287,CELG,"The year 2017 has been quite a impressive one for the biotech sector as evident from the 19.4% gain registered so far by the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (^. This is surely welcome news for investors since the industry suffered a decline of 19.2% last year.While drug pricing issue, competition and a slowdown in growth of key drugs dented the sector’s 2016 performance, new drug approvals and encouraging outlook by the companies boosted investor sentiment in 2017.Immuno-oncology continued to remain in spotlight in 2017. The FDA’s approval of CAR-T (chimeric antigen T-cell receptor) therapies like Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta for leukemia and lymphoma shifted investors’ attention toward small biotechs companies developing these therapies. Investors also kept tab of key candidates’ data.The slowdown in mature products forced bigwigs like Gilead to undertake acquisitions to bolster pipelines. Gilead acquired erstwhile Kite Pharma to add Yescarta to its kitty. The company also inked an agreement to acquire Cell Design Labs. Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) too might be on the look-out for acquisitions to bolster its portfolio.Approval of new drugs like Dupixient, Kevzara, Idhifa, Tremfya among others along with label expansion of existing drugs like Cabometyx boosted the respective companies’ portfolios. We note that 2017 saw a larger number of drug approvals from the FDA than 2016.Although the threat of biosimilars loom large on the sector, we expect a further boost in performance from the sector in 2018.  Notably, the Medical - Biomed/Genetics sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 114, which places it at the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries.While the smaller biotechs have performed impressively in 2017, the bigwigs weren’t far behind and we expect the momentum to continue in 2018 as well. Here we list a few biotech companies which should outperform the market in 2018:ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACAD  -  Free Report)’s lead drug Nuplazid is approved for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease psychosis. The drug was approved in 2016 by the FDA. Notably, it is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. The drug generated sales of $81.3 million in the first nine months of 2017 and the company is looking to expand the drug’s label further. 2017 was a roller-coaster ride for Acadia. Shares of the company have moved up 5.6% year-to-date compared with the industry’s  gain of 4.8%. We believe this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company should perform well in 2018 boosted by Nulpazid.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. (Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

3290,CELG,"The biotech industry has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year. After declining 27.1% last year, the Medical-Biotech /Genetics industry has risen 15.3% this year so far, outpacing 12.7% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up almost 26% year to date after sliding 19.1% in 2016. The Zacks Industry Rank is #106 (to 40% of the 250 plus Zacks industries) for Medical-Biomed and Genetics, indicating a bright outlook for the sector going forward.The biotech sector has a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year. Another factor that has contributed to the sector’s surge is that President Trump's expected action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared.These factors should continue to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next as well despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. On the broader macro front, the proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last.With biotech stocks on a tear, here we have picked three of the biggest biotech companies which look well poised for growth and can be added to one’s portfolioAmgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)Amgen is one of the leading biotechnology companies in the world with several blockbuster drugs in its portfolio. Amgen’s newer drugs – Prolia, Xgeva, Vectibix, Nplate and Sensipar – are all performing well. Amgen is also progressing with its pipeline, including biosimilar drugs. Last month, it received FDA approval for Mvasi, its biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Avastin. Mvasi is the first biosimilar approved in the United States for the treatment of cancer. Other recent positive pipeline/regulatory developments at Amgen include EU approval for a pediatric formulation of Mimpara, positive long-term data from Kyprolis ENDEAVOR study, and regulatory filings for label expansion of Prolia and Kyprolis, among others.Supported by the positive developments, Amgen’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. Shares have risen 28%, comparing favorably with the industry’s gain. Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Earnings estimates for 2017 have risen 1.2% while that for 2018 have gone up by 1.3% in the past 90 days.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report)Celgene’s key growth driver, multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, continues to drive revenues at the company. Meanwhile, Celgene’s label expansion efforts for Revlimid bode well for further sales growth of the drug. Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla – are also performing well. A recent positive development at Celgene was the FDA approval for Idhifa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)Celgene also carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

Biogen is trying to diversify its pipelineand is looking to strengthen its Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Newly launched Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy is also off to a promising start. Spinraza has witnessed faster-than-expected adoption in the United States and Biogen is ramping up launch efforts  internationally.Recent key positive pipeline/regulatory developments at Biogen include promising long-term dataon Alzheimer disease candidate, aducanumab and EU approval of Imraldi, Biogen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s top-selling blockbuster drug, Humira.

Scangos and CFO Paul Clancy.Biogen, also a #2 Ranked stock, has seen its 2017 earnings estimates rise 4.7% for 2017 and 2.3% for 2017 over the past 90 days. Shares have risen 11.5% this year.Two other biotech companies, though smaller than the above mentioned companies, are worth mentioning.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) has seen its share price shoot up 106.6% this year so far with earnings estimates rising 5% for 2017 and 6.8% for 2018. The stock is riding high on the success of its cystic fibrosis (CF) pipeline, particularly its triple combination CF regimens as these have the potential to treat up to 90% of CF patients.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) saw the launch of its key pipeline candidates Dupixent for atopic dermatitis and Kevzara for rheumatoid arthritis in the United States this year. Both the drugs are also approved in the EU.

3291,CELG,"Shares of Bluebird Bio (BLUE  -  Free Report), a major player in the emerging gene therapy and CAR-T research markets, slumped more than 6% in morning trading Monday after receiving a key analyst downgrade.In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley downgraded the biotech firm from “Equal weight” to “Underweight” and reiterated its price target of $105.00 per share. That call would represent a 23.5% drop from Friday’s close.Morgan Stanley’s Matt Harrison said that he expects shares to underperform, citing headwinds in Bluebird’s sickle cell business. Still, the analyst noted that Bluebird’s BCMA-targeting CAR-T candidate does provide some valuation support.As most biotech investors will know by now, CAR-T therapy is an emerging method for treating cancer that includes making genetic changes to a patient’s immune T-cells and reinjecting them into the body to attack cancer cells.Bluebird currently has several active clinical and pre-clinical programs under its CAR-T umbrella. The company’s lead CAR-T program, bb2121, is a collaboration with biotech giant Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) and has produced encouraging data thus far in its Phase 1 study.It’s been a busy year for the CAR-T industry, as several major milestones have been reached. In August, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) received approval for its innovative new lymphoblastic leukemia treatment, making it the first approved CAR-T therapy in the world.And earlier that same week, biotech behemoth Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that it was acquiring Kite Pharma , another competitor in the CAR-T market. Gilead will pay a staggering $11.9 billion for Kite, which is expected to receive approval for its own CAR-T therapy in November.For more on the current state of the CAR-T market, check out our Friday Finish Line team’s exclusive interview with Brad Loncar, the creator of the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy Index:Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3292,CELG,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its regulatory application to include overall survival (OS) data from the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study on the label of its multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis. Please note that the FDA’s decision comes much earlier than expected. It was initially expected in April.Amgen had submitted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA in July last year. The regulatory application in the EU seeking approval to include OS data from ENDEAVOR study was also submitted in the same month.Data presented from the ENDEAVOR study earlier had demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Takeda’s Velcade plus dexamethasone in second-line multiple myeloma setting. The Kyprolis plus dexamethasone arm reduced the risk of death by 21% and increased OS by 7.6 months compared to the combination of Velcade plus dexamethasone.While Kyprolis is already approved for this patient population, the overall survival data should help drive usage and boost sales.Other ongoing studies for Kyprolisinclude a phase III ARROW study, which is evaluating a weekly dosing regimen of Kyprolis in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients and a phase III ASPIRE study evaluating a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis plus Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma compared to Revlimid and dexamethasone (Rd).Amgen has also formed collaboration with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) to study the combination of Kyprolis and J&J’s Darzalex in multiple clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Kyprolis generated sales of $207 million in the third quarter of 2017, recording year-over-year growth of 13% driven by higher demand and robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Shares of Amgen were up more than 1% on Wednesday. In the past year, Amgen’s shares have returned 22.2%  compared with 3.8% increase registered by the industry.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked biotech stock is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3294,CELG,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for treatment of refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The drug was added to Gilead’s portfolio following the recent acquisition of Kite Pharma, earlier this month.Notably, Yescarta is the first CAR-T therapy approved by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The candidate is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in the first half of 2018.Shares of Gilead have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has rallied 13.4% against the broader industry’s 12% decrease. The approval was supported by positive data from ZUMA-1 phase II study. Finds from the study showed that a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 72%, including 51% of patients with no detectable traces of cancer remaining. Also, 95% of patients achieved complete remission at a median follow-up of 7.9 months, who had not earlier reached the estimated median duration of response.Significantly, this CART therapy will be manufactured at Kite Pharma’s state-of-the-art commercial manufacturing facility in El Segundo, California. In the ZUMA-1 pivotal trial, Kite Pharma achieved a manufacturing success rate of 99% with a median manufacturing turnaround time of 17 days.We remind investors that Novartis A.G. (NVS  -  Free Report) has also received an FDA approval for its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), in August for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later stage relapse.Additionally, Juno Therapeutics  is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on its CAR-T technologies in partnership with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) for healing adults with r/r aggressive NHL, including r/r DLBCL. Hence, Gilead is expected to face an intense competition from these products in the long run.Per the company’s press release, approximately 7,500 patients in the United States, who have ran out of option to fight the disease, are detected with refractory DLBCL each year. Among them, only 7% achieves a complete remission when treated with the current standard of care.Hence, given the huge market opportunity open for Yescarta, the company can widely address the vast unmet need of patients suffering from the disease despite approved therapies in the market with such new treatment options brought to the table.Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3295,CELG,"Shares of Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) declined after the company announced that a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on pipeline candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004) will be discontinued. Celgene’s stock has moved up 84.2% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 13.6%.The decision to discontinue the trial comes following a recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim futility analysis.Consequently, the phase III trial, DEFINE (CD-003) for Crohn’s Disease will not be initiated. Meanwhile, Celgene is waiting to review the full dataset from the phase II trial in ulcerative colitis to determine next steps.The news comes as a disappointment as the candidate was in late stage of development. Celgene’s Inflammatory Bowel Disease Portfolio currently consists of ozanimod (phase III) and Otezla (phase II ongoing for UC; pending positive results, a phase III trial will be initiated in 2018).Otezla is approved for patients suffering from moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. The drug is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis.Celgene is currently working on label expansion of drugs like Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla, among others. Meanwhile, Celgene’s Revlimid continued to outperform driven by further market share increases in newly diagnosed myeloma and the continued increase in treatment duration. The recent approval of Idhifa in the United States for relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia has further boosted the company’s portfolio.However, Celgene is highly dependent on Revlimid, while foreign exchange headwinds are expected to continue while Abraxane sales are under competitive pressure.Last month, Celgene aannounced that the FDA put a hold on several trials in the FUSION program. Partial clinical hold has been put on five trials and a full clinical hold on one trial.The trials are evaluating Imfinzi, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in combination with immunomodulatory and chemotherapy agents in blood cancers such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma. Celgene entered into a strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca PLC's (AZN  -  Free Report) MedImmune in April 2015 to develop and commercialize Imfinzi for hematologic malignancies in combination with Revlimid, Pomalyst, Vidaza and others.The FDA had placed a hold on these trials due to risks identified in other trials for an anti-PD-1 antibody, Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, in patients with multiple myeloma in combination with immunomodulatory agents.Zacks Rank & Key Pick Celgene currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Aduro Biotech, Inc.

3296,CELG,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25 after the market closes. Amgen delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.83% in the last quarter.Amgen shares are up 25.9% so far this year. This compares favorably with the 12.1% increase registered by the industry during this period.Amgen’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company reporting positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.85%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors at PlayAmgen’s newer products like Prolia, Xgeva, Kyprolis, and Blincyto, should continue to perform well backed by higher demand, thus making up for lower sales of mature brands like Enbrel, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen due to competitive pressure.Neulasta demand is being hurt due to competition from PD-1s and other new cancer therapiesNeupogen sales are also being hurt by biosimilar competition in the United States mainly from Zarxio, Sandoz’s biosimilar version of Neupogen, which was launched in September 2015.Neulasta and Neupogen sales are expected to be hurt by competitive dynamics in the third and fourth quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Neulasta and Neupogen are $1.10 billion and $133 million, respectively for the third quarter/However, management mentioned on the Q2 call that, “no new U.S. biosimilar competition” is expected this year. This suggests that Neulasta and Epogen may not start facing any biosimilar competition this year, contrary to previous expectations.Three companies - Mylan/Biocon, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), and Coherus - looking to launch generic versions of Neulasta and one company looking to launch generic version of Epogen have received complete response letter from the FDA for their respective applications, which can delay their launch.The bottom line will continue to be driven by the company’s overall cost-cutting efforts and share buyback. The company’s restructuring plan will likely make it leaner and more cost efficient.Investor focus will remain on the performance of the company’s PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha. Uptake of Repatha, which gained FDA approval in August 2015, has not been very encouraging so far due to pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. However, in the second quarter, Repatha revenues improved sequentially driven by higher demand. Management said that the presentation of the outcomes study data (FOURIER) had a positive impact on Repatha share trends. It remains to be seen if the positive trends continue in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.37% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.07 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Amgen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Amgen Inc.

3297,CELG,"Shares of Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated (CORT  -  Free Report) has soared 158.8% so far this year, massively outperforming the 9.5% growth registered by the industry. Here we analyze the factors that led to the rally.Corcept’s only marketed drug, Korlym (mifepristone), is approved for the treatment of patients with Cushing's syndrome.The company is striving to commercialize Korlym successfully by deploying medical liaisons and sales representatives. About 10-15 of every 1 million people are newly diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome each year, which translates to more than 3,000 new patients annually in the United States. Increased awareness among physicians and patients about the drug and expanded sales efforts is likely to bolster sales.Meanwhile, Corcept is currently working on developing the drug for additional indications. It is conducting a phase I/II safety and efficacy study on Korlym in combination with Eisai Co., Ltd.’s anti-cancer drug Halaven for the treatment of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Enrolment in the study is complete and the company announced encouraging data in December 2016. We anticipate a successful label expansion of Korlym to boost the top line significantly, as the disease represents huge potential with as many as 40,000 women in the United States being diagnosed every year.The University of Chicago is conducting a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xtandi, for the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. The institution also plans to conduct a phase II study on Korlym, in combination with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Abraxane, for the treatment of patients with TNBC.Importantly, apart from Korlym, Corcept is also evaluating CORT125134 for Cushing’s syndrome and a range of solid tumors. Early data on the candidate for Cushing’s syndrome has been quite promising. The company has begun dosing patients in a phase I/II study on CORT125134, in combination with Abraxane, for the treatment of a range of solid-tumor cancers. The possible target indications include triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and sarcoma.The company also has selective cortisol modulator CORT118335 in phase I study and results are expected in the second quarter of 2018. This compound is very potent in animal models of fatty liver disease along with both the prevention and reversal of weight gain caused by antipsychotic medications such as Zyprexa (olanzapine). The company expects to begin phase II trials for both indications in the third quarter of 2018.Also, during the third quarter of 2017 earnings release, the company raised 2017 revenue guidance. The company now projects revenues to be in the range of $157-$162 million, higher than its prior expectation of $145-$155 million. Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated Price  Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated Price | Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCorcept has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3298,CELG,"Key highlights this week include the announcement of a couple of acquisition agreements as well as pipeline news from Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report). The M&A announcements relate to the acquisition of Ignyta  by Roche and Sucampo Pharmaceuticals  by Mallinckrodt.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCelgene Down on Revlimid Combo Data: Celgene’s shares were down on disappointing data on a combination evaluating the company’s blockbuster cancer drug, Revlimid, in treatment-naïve follicular lymphoma patients. The late-stage RELEVANCE study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared to the standard of care with Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance. The R2 treatment arm failed to achieve superiority in the co-primary endpoints of complete response or unconfirmed complete response (CR/CRu) at 120 weeks and progression-free survival (Read more: Celgene Down on Discouraging Data on Revlimid).Celgene’s shares are down 7.6% year to date compared to the 3% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Acquisition Agreements Announced: A couple of acquisition deals were announced this week. The first agreement will see Ignyta being acquired by Swiss pharma giant Roche in an all-cash deal valued at $1.7 billion ($27 per share). Ignyta is focused on developing precisely targeted therapeutics guided by diagnostics for patients with rare cancers. With this acquisition, slated to close in the first half of 2018, Roche will add entrectinib to its portfolio – entrectinib is currently in mid-stage development.The second agreement will see Sucampo being acquired by Mallinckrodt for $18 per share or approximately $1.2 billion. With this acquisition, Mallinckrodt will get a source of near-term net sales and earnings accretion through Amitiza and will boost its rare diseases pipeline with VTS-270 and CPP-1X/sulindac. This deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. Sucampo is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Biogen’s Shares Down on Alzheimer’s Data: Biogen’s shares declined 3.3% on data from an ongoing Alzheimer’s disease study on BAN2401, which is being developed in collaboration with Eisai. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint in the phase II study. With the study failing to show an early positive result, the companies said that the blinded study, which is being conducted in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer’s disease (collectively known as early Alzheimer’s disease) will continue with a comprehensive final analysis to be conducted at 18 months. These results are expected to be obtained during the second half of 2018. The study data comes as a disappointment as positive data would have been a major boost. Moreover, the results have raised concerns about the candidate’s chances of success given the high rate of failure experienced by other companies in bringing Alzheimer’s disease treatments to market (Read more: Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Misses Goal in Interim Analysis).BioMarin PDUFA Date Extended: The FDA has extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) Goal Date for BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s (BMRN  -  Free Report) pegvaliase by three months to May 28, 2018. BioMarin is looking to get the investigational therapy approved for the reduction of blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in adult patients with phenylketonuria (“PKU”) who have uncontrolled blood Phe levels on existing management. The extension was expected as the agency had asked the company to submit additional Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (""CMC"") information. The company said that due to the Memorial Day weekend, the Action Goal Date will be May 25, 2018 (Read more: Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Misses Goal in Interim Analysis).Agios Submits Ivosidenib NDA: Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO  -  Free Report) has submitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”) seeking FDA approval for ivosidenib (AG-120), an investigational oral treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) and an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation. The company has asked for priority review which would cut down the review period to six months.Agios also announced that it has received permission from the FDA to move another pipeline candidate, AG-270, into clinical studies.

3299,CELG,"Shares of Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) were down after the company reported disappointing data from the phase III study, RELEVANCE, on Revlimid in combination with Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report)’s Rituxan for treatment-naïve follicular lymphoma.The study evaluated Revlimid plus Rituxan (R2) followed by R2 maintenance compared with the standard of care featuring Rituxan plus chemotherapy (R-CHOP, R-bendamustine or R-VN CVP) followed by Rituxan maintenance on patients with previously untreated for follicular lymphoma.However, the R2  treatment arm could not achieve superiority in the co-primary endpoints of complete response or unconfirmed complete response CR/CRu) at 120 weeks and in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) observed during the pre-planned analysis. None of the arms proved superior for either of the co-primary endpoints. Meanwhile, an additional analysis of the trial is underway.Revlimid, an oral immunomodulatory drug, is currently approved for several indications including MM, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma.The failure of the study is disappointing as Revlimid is Celgene’s growth driver and the drug’s label expansion would have boosted its sales potential for the company expected lymphoma to majorly increase Revlimid’s growth prospects by 2020 and beyond. AUGMENT — a combination with Rituxan in relapsed/refractory follicular and marginal zone lymphoma — is also in progress. While Revlimid sales continue to be impressive, we are concerned about the company’s sole dependence on the product for growth. Celgene’s stock has lost 21.3% of its value in the last six months against the industry’s loss of 7.4%. The stock was also hit earlier after a phase III trial, REVOLVE, (CD-002) on the candidate GED-0301 in Crohn’s disease and the extension trial, SUSTAIN (CD-004), was discontinued.The deep yet persistently slow growth of the psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis markets, especially during the entire third quarter, has led to a weak performance of Otezla. Consequently, the company also reduced its annual guidance. The challenging market conditions were driven by an increasingly restrictive PBM formulary control.Meanwhile, in August 2017, the company obtained an FDA approval for Idhifa (enasidenib) for treatment of relapsed and/or refractory acute myeloid leukemia with isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The drug was developed in partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AGIO  -  Free Report).Going forward, we expect approval of new drugs to boost the top line. Celgene is also encouragingly working on the label expansion of drugs like Pomalyst/Imnovid and Abraxane among others. For instance, Pomalyst/Imnovid is being evaluated in multiple combination studies for relapsed/refractory MM.  The drug’s label was recently updated in the United States as well as the EU to include data from a pooled pharmacokinetics analysis of patients with relapsed and/or refractory MM and an impaired renal function.  Zacks Rank & Key PickCelgene is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3300,CELG,"Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved immunotherapy drug Tecentriq as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after they have been previously treated with chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 status.The EC also granted marketing authorisation of the drug as a monotherapy for the treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have been previously treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy or who are considered ineligible for cisplatin chemotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 status.We note that the drug is already approved in the United States for these indications.Approval in other geographies will further boost sales. Per estimates, 1.59 million patients die every year due to lung cancer.Earlier in the month, the FDA has put a partial clinical hold on a phase Ib and phase I/II b trials evaluating Tecentriq, due to safety issues. A partial hold was put due to emerging safety data from clinical trials evaluating Merck & Co.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in combination with Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid and Pomalyst.Roche also announced that the EC has approved a label expansion of Gazyvaro. The drug has been approved in combination with chemotherapy, followed by Gazyvaro maintenance in patients achieving a response, as a new treatment for previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma.The approval was based on results from the the phase III GALLIUM study which showed show superior progression-free survival over MabThera.We note that the drug was approved in combination with chlorambucil, for patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with comorbidities that make them unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine-based therapy in 2014. Gazyvaro was also approved in combination with bendamustine, followed by Gazyvaro maintenance, in patients with follicular lymphoma who did not respond or who progressed during or up to six months after treatment with MabThera or a MabThera-containing regimen.In addition, the EC approved Actemra/RoActemra (tocilizumab) for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA) making it the first therapy approved for the treatment of GCA in Europe as per Roche. The drug was also approved in the Unites States for this indication in May 2017. Actemra is approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Roche’s stock has gained 15.2% year to date compared with industry’s gain of 20.1%.Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market. The company dominates the breast cancer space due to the strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla.However, sales of Avastin and Tarceva continue to decline. Generic competition for Xeloda continues to hurt sales. Competition from biosimilars looms large on Roche's key drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and Rituxan. The FDA has accepted Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Biologics License Application for a proposed biosimilar version of Rituxan. Hence, approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing drugs will bode well for Roche.Zacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3302,CELG,"Novartis AG‘s (NVS  -  Free Report) supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for or relapse after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has been accepted by the FDA for Priority Review.Moreover, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) also granted accelerated assessment to the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Kymriah for the treatment of children and young adults with r/r B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and for adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are ineligible for ASCT.We remind investors that Kymriah was the first CAR-T therapy to obtain FDA approval in August 2017 for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse.A novel immunocellular therapy and one-time treatment, Kymriah uses patient's T cells to fight cancer. CAR-T is manufactured for individual patients using their own cells thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogrammed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells to express a chimeric antigen receptor to recognize and fight cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen. The drug was developed in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. The approval is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.  The approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL which comprises approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children under 15 years old and is the most common childhood cancer in the United States. Kymriah has been launched in the United States.The respective designations from the FDA and EMA will expedite the standard review time. Assuming approval from the FDA and EMA, Kymriah will be the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy available for two distinct indications in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and B-cell ALL. The applications were based on data from the sponsored global clinical trial program of Kymriah in children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL and adult patients with r/r DLBCL demonstrating the efficacy and safety of Kymriah across studies. The results from the pivotal phase II trial, JULIET, served as the basis of the sBLA and MAA for Kymriah in adult patients with r/r DLCBL. Results from the pivotal phase II ELIANA study were submitted as part of the MAA for Kymriah in children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL.Novartis plans additional regulatory submissions for Kymriah in pediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL and adult patients with r/r DLBCL beyond the United States and EU in 2018.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 27.2% in the past one year compared with the industry’s 25.7% gain.The CAR-T therapy space was in the spotlight in 2017 with the approval of Kymriah. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma and obtained FDA approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s chimeric CAR-T therapy candidate.Meanwhile, rumours surfaced that Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) is in advanced talks to acquire Juno Therapeutics .  Juno’s pipeline includes CD19 and CD22 directed CAR T-cell product candidates.Given the immense potential of the therapy, we expect the spotlight in this space in 2018.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Immuno-oncology remains a key focus area with Gilead acquiring Kite last year for $11.9 billion and Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) currently rumored to be interested in acquiring Juno .New product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, continued strong performance from key products, growing demand for drugs especially for rare-to-treat diseases, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the momentum in 2018.That said, headwinds remain in the form of drug pricing scrutiny, pricing pressure, increasing competition, the growing presence of biosimilars, generic competition, a slowdown in the growth of legacy products, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena and major pipeline setbacks.How to Pick WinnersAnyone interested in biotech and pharma stocks will know that it could be challenging to pick winners in this “high risk - high returns” industry which is constantly growing and changing. Companies which hit the bull’s eye become overnight success stories with shares doubling or even tripling on positive news. However, negative outcomes have an equally strong effect on the shares and failure may very well spell doom for these companies.In such a scenario, let’s take a look at stocks preferred by analysts who have a deep knowledge and understanding of the industry and its companies. We have zeroed in on three stocks with the help of our Zacks Stock Screener - these stocks have been given a Strong Buy or Buy rating by 80% or more brokers and sport a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertex is a key player in the cystic fibrosis (“CF”) market with two products, Orkambi and Kalydeco, in its CF portfolio.

3304,CELG,"Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced long-term follow-up data from a phase II study, evaluating its chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), for treatment of patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Detailed results from this study were presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in Atlanta.Notably, the drug was added to Gilead’s portfolio following the acquisition of Kite Pharma in early October. Subsequently, it received an FDA approval later in the same month for treating refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). The drug is also under review in the EU with a tentative approval expected in the first half of 2018.Shares of Gilead have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 3.6% against the broader industry’s 2.6% increase.The updated data from the ZUMA-1 study showed that the drug with a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 42%, including 40% of patients achieving complete remission at a median follow-up of 15.4 months. The study was conducted on a total of 108 patients. Notably, the previously reported data from the study showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 72%, including 95% of patients achieving complete remission at a median follow-up of 7.9 months.We remind investors that Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) has also received an FDA approval for its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), in August for treatment of patients aged up to 25 years with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later stage relapse.Additionally, Juno Therapeutics  is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on its CAR-T technologies in partnership with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) for curing adults with r/r aggressive NHL, including r/r DLBCL. Hence Gilead is expected to face a fierce competition from these products in the long run.Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price Gilead Sciences, Inc. Price | Gilead Sciences, Inc.

3305,CELG,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced updated results from the pivotal JULIET study. It showed sustained complete responses at six months with Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion, in adult patients with a difficult-to-treat cancer- relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy approved.  The drug has been developed in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. This novel immunocellular therapy and one-time treatment uses patient's T cells to fight cancer.CAR T therapies are developed for individual patients using their own cells, thereby making it different from typical small molecule or biologic therapies.So far this year, Novartis’ shares have gained 15.2%, compared with the industry’s growth of 15.6%.JULIET is the first multi-center global registration study for Kymriah in adult patients with r/r DLBCL and the second global CAR-T cell therapy trial. In the study at six months, 30% of patients treated with Kymriah showed complete response. The relapse-free probability at six months after first response was 74%. Median overall survival was not achieved and the median time from infusion to data cutoff was 5.6 months. When the patients with DLBCL enrolled for this study, they had to go through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and many had unsuccessful stem cell transplants, leaving them with few options and a poor prognosis. The study showed that Kymriah was able to considerably increase their chance of achieving and maintaining a sustained response without stem cell transplant, thus highlighting its benefit.Additionally, the study revealed that cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 58% of the  total patients under treatment while 23% experienced grade 3/4 CRS (15% grade 3; 8% grade 4) using the Penn Grading Scale. Also, it showed that 21% of patients experienced any grade neurologic events and 12% of patients had grade 3/4 neurologic adverse events, who were provided supportive care.In the study, 26 patients (26%) were infused in the outpatient setting of which 20 patients (77%) remained outpatient for three or more days after infusion.43 patients discontinued before infusiondue to rapid progression of their disease or deterioration in their clinical status.According to the study, only nine out of 147 (6.1%) enrolled patients could not be infused due to inability to manufacture an adequate dose of CAR-T cells.Novartis submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA in October for Kymriah suspension for intravenous infusion. The applicationwas filed for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).Again in November, the company submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Kymriah for the treatment of adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are ineligible for ASCT and for children as well as young adults with r/r B-cell ALL.Of late, Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) also received FDA approval for Yescarta — a CAR-T therapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Yescarta is the first CAR-T therapy approved by the FDA for this indication.Another company, bluebird bio, Inc.’s (BLUE  -  Free Report) anti-BCMA CAR T therapy, bb21217, is being evaluated for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. bb21217 as well as bb2121 are being developed in collaboration with Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report).Novartis AG Price Novartis AG Price | Novartis AG QuoteZacks Rank Novartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3306,CELG,"The immuno-oncology space has been in the limelight in 2017. The CAR-T therapy space in particular, has been grabbing investors, courtesy of two key approvals.The FDA’s approval of Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse in patients up to 25 years of age was a significant boost for this space. Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy approved.A novel immunocellular therapy and one-time treatment, Kymriah uses patient's T cells to fight cancer. Novartis also submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application to the FDA for Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for intravenous infusion for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Kymriah was given Breakthrough Therapy designation for r/r DLBCL which, if approved, will be the second indication for Kymriah.While the long-term impact of the treatment is yet to be evaluated, the approval opens up new frontiers for cancer treatment. To start with, CAR-T uses patient’s cells to identify and destroy cancer cells, thereby making it different from other small molecule or biologic therapies. During the treatment, T cells are drawn from a patient's blood. These cells are then reprogramed in the manufacturing facility to create genetically coded cells. This leads to the creation of a chimeric antigen receptor which recognizes and fights cancer cells and other B cells expressing a specific antigen.Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) acquired Kite Pharma to foray into this space. The FDA’s approval of Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), the latter’s CAR-T therapy candidate provided a significant boost. The FDA approved the therapy as a treatment for refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which includes DLBCL, transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma.  The therapy is also under review in Europe and an approval is expected in 2018.  Gilead also acquired therapy candidates in clinical trials in both hematologic cancers and solid tumors, including KITE-585, a CAR-T therapy candidate that targets B-cell maturation antigen expressed in multiple myeloma.Given the vast potential of the therapy, biotech companies are leaving no stone unturned to develop their pipeline candidates. Nevertheless, stiff competition continues to remain a major concern.Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on CAR and high-affinity TCR technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells.  The company is currently conducting a phase I trial with JCAR017 in adult r/r aggressive NHL, including r/r DLBCL. The company plans to initiate a phase I/II trial with JCAR017 in r/r chronic lymphocyctic leukemia (CLL) in the fourth quarter of 2017.The company expects the FDA to approve r/rDLBCL in 2018 and r/r CLL in 2019.  Shares of the company have surged a whopping 220% year to date. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report) in collaboration with Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) is evaluating bb2121, a CAR-T cell product candidate for the treatment of multiple myeloma in a phase I study.  bb2121 targets b-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) in previously treated patients with multiple myeloma. It was granted a Breakthrough Therapy status by the FDA. Both companies are also developing a second anti-BCMA CAR-T program, bb21217. Shares of the company have increased 171.0% year to date. The company presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (ZIOP  -  Free Report) is developing CAR-T cell therapies for advanced lymphoid malignancies. The company is currently enroling patients for an investigator-led phase I study using second-generation CD19-specific CAR+ T cells with a revised CAR structure in patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies.

3307,CELG,"Pipeline and regulatory updates were the focus this week with Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE  -  Free Report) gaining FDA approval for its first drug while companies like Cytokinetics (CYTK  -  Free Report) and Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR  -  Free Report) were hit by pipeline setbacks.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesUltragenyx Gets FDA Approval for Rare Genetic Disease Drug: Ultragenyx gained FDA approval for its first drug, Mepsevii (vestronidase alfa), for the treatment of children and adults with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS 7), also known as Sly syndrome. Mepsevii is also the first medicine to be approved for this rare genetic disease, which is estimated to affect about 200 patients in the developed world. Mepsevii will be launched later this month and the FDA has asked for a post-marketing study to evaluate the long-term safety of the product. With MPS 7 being an extraordinarily rare disease, sales should build up gradually as patients are identified and placed on therapy.   Meanwhile, Mepsevii is currently under review in the EU where an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) should be available in the first half of 2018.In addition to gaining FDA approval for Mepsevii, Ultragenyx also got a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, which can be used to gain priority review for any subsequent drug application that is not eligible for priority review. The company can also sell the voucher for millions of dollars to any other company that wants to fasten the review process for its candidate. BioMarin, United Therapeutics and Knight Therapeutics are some of the companies that sold their priority review vouchers for millions of dollars (Read more: Ultragenyx's rhGUS Gets FDA Nod for Rare Genetic Disease).Cytokinetics Down on Phase III Setback: Cytokinetics’s shares plunged 25.7% on negative data from the company’s late-stage study on tirasemtiv in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”). The company said that the study failed to meet the primary endpoint as well as the secondary endpoints. Cytokinetics has decided to suspend the development of tirasemtiv with the focus now shifting to Cytokinetics’s next-generation fast skeletal muscle activator, CK-2127107, which the company believes will be better tolerated and potentially more effective than tirasemtiv. Phase II results on CK-2127107 are expected in 2018. CK-2127107 is also being evaluated for spinal muscular atrophy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, afflicts about 30,000 people in the United States with approximately 6,000 new cases being diagnosed every year in the country. There is high unmet need for new therapies with the average life expectancy of an ALS patient being about three to five years after diagnosis while only 10% of patients survive for more than 10 years. Cytokinetics had previously said that tirasemtiv could generate sales of more than $600 million - $1.1 billion in the United States alone.Cytokinetics’s shares are down 32.1% year to date, compared to the 0.6% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.Acorda Scraps Tozadenant Program: Just a few days after announcing safety issues associated with a late-stage study on its investigational treatment for Parkinson’s disease, Acorda said that it is discontinuing its clinical development program for tozadenant (Read more: Acorda Stock Up Despite Phase III Trial on Tozadenant Stops). The company said that it will immediately discontinue dosing of all participants currently enrolled in its tozadenant studies. The decision to discontinue development was based on new information obtained from the phase III program related to previously disclosed agranulocytosis (the absence of white blood cells, which fight infection) and associated serious adverse events. The company said that it could not be confident that weekly white blood cell count screening would be enough to ensure patient safety.Last week, Acorda had announced that it had identified cases of agranulocytosis, possibly drug-related, in some cases associated with sepsis and death. At that time, the company had said that there would be a higher frequency of blood cell count monitoring in the phase III program for tozadenant (Read more: Acorda Reports Death in Parkinson's Trials, Stock Down 40%).Tozadenant, an oral adenosine A2a receptor antagonist, became a part of Acorda’s pipeline following its 2016 acquisition of Biotie (for approximately $376 million). Last year, Acorda had said that three of its pipeline candidates – Inbrija (CVT-301) and tozadenant for Parkinson’s and Plumiaz in epilepsy - represent potential U.S. peak net sales of more than $1 billion. However, in addition to the tozadenant setback, Acorda ran into trouble with Plumiaz and discontinued that program in 2016.It has also not been smooth sailing for Inbrija. The company had filed a new drug application (“NDA”) for Inbrija in June 2017 but the FDA issued a Refusal to File (“RTF”) letter. Acorda intends to resubmit the NDA by year end.These pipeline setbacks will weigh on Acorda, which could start facing generic competition for its flagship drug, Ampyra, from August 2018.Six Months Additional Exclusivity for UTHR’s Adcirca: United Therapeutics (UTHR  -  Free Report) announced that it has gained pediatric exclusivity in the United States for its pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”) treatment, Adcirca. This means the drug will now enjoy exclusivity through May 21, 2018 before the FDA can grant approval to a generic version (Read more: United Therapeutics PAH Drug's Exclusivity Period Extended).Alnylam Starts Rolling NDA for Patisiran: Alnylam has started submitting a rolling NDA in the United States for patisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting transthyretin (“TTR”) for the treatment of hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis. The company expects to finish the submission by year end. Alnylam is seeking priority review for the NDA – if granted, the review process would be cut down to six months. Meanwhile, a regulatory application in the EU will also be submitted around the end of this year. Alnylam has a collaboration agreement with Sanofi for patisiran – once approved, the drug will be marketed by Alnylam in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, while Sanofi will sell the product in the rest of the world (Read more: Alnylam Starts Rolling NDA Submission for RNAi Candidate).TESARO Ovarian Cancer Drug Gets EU Nod: TESARO’s (TSRO  -  Free Report) ovarian cancer drug, Zejula, gained approval from the European Commission (“EC”) for use as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete response (“CR”) or partial response (“PR”) to platinum-based chemotherapy. This makes Zejula the first PARP inhibitor to be approved in Europe regardless of BRCA mutation or biomarker status. The treatment will initially be launched in Germany and the UK this December. EU approval was largely expected considering the CHMP had issued a positive opinion about Zejula in September. Zejula is already available in the United States where it gained approval earlier this year in March (Read more: TESARO Ovarian Cancer Drug Zejula Gets Approval in EU).   TESARO is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

3308,CELG,"Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) announced new data from the dose expansion part of a phase I study, evaluating its IDH1 mutant inhibitor, ivosidenib (AG-120), as a single agent for treating low grade isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutant (IDH1m) glioma. Data was presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuro-Oncology (“SNO”) in San Francisco.Agios’ shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has surged 42.9% compared with the industry’s rally of 22.5%.The new data from the dose expansion part demonstrated durable stable disease and reduction of tumor growth rates for patients with low grade glioma. The median progression free survival was 13 months. The median treatment duration was 16 months on treatment with ivosidenib, comparing favorably to the pre-treatment interval of 9.6 months.Notably, the phase I study is assessing the safety and tolerability of ivosidenib in advanced solid tumors, including glioma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and chondrosarcomas that harbor an IDH1 mutation.Per the press release, the company also presented preclinical data, evaluating ivosidenib and its pan-IDH mutant inhibitor, AG-881, in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model of human mIDH1-R132H glioma as posters. Data from the study demonstrated that ivosidenib and AG-881 resulted in suppression of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels in brain tumor mouse models.Notably, earlier the company had announced that it plans to initiate a perioperative window study to evaluate ivosidenib and AG-881 in low grade glioma for investigating their effects on brain tumor tissue in the first half of 2018.We remind investors that Agios is conducting a phase I/II study in combination with Celgene's (CELG  -  Free Report) Vidaza for treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients, not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. The FDA granted an orphan drug designation to ivosidenib for treatment of AML patients. The company said that it is on track to submit a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for ivosidenib by this year-end.Ivosidenib is also being evaluated in a phase III study to evaluate ivosidenib in front-line AML patients with an IDH1 mutant-positive advanced cholangiocarcinoma.Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

3309,CELG,"With a busy earnings season almost coming to an end after an impressive run, we are again focused on latest cancer updates happening every week. The week gone by saw three cancer drugs receiving FDA approval for new indications – Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Gazyva, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent and AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Faslodex. However, an interesting product in development is a cancer vaccine that Moderna Therapeutics and Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) are working on. Merck has provided a fund of $200 million to develop the vaccine in combination with its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, in return for a right to half of the potential sales. The vaccine will be personalized and Moderna has just developed one for its first enrolled patient. Top-line data is expected in September 2019. AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (AVEO  -  Free Report) also announced the launch of its first drug, Fotivda, which was approved in Europe for treating kidney cancer in August 2017.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAstraZeneca's Faslodex Approved for Combination Use: The FDA approved a new indication for breast cancer drug, Faslodex, on Nov 15. The label of Faslodex will now be expanded to include combination use with Eli Lilly’s (LLY) new CDK4/6 inhibitor Verzenio to treat women with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after endocrine therapy.
