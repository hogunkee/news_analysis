1,DLR,"The explosion of data resulting from the digital age is keeping company executives on the lookout for better ways to handle the tsunami of information.X It first led to the emergence of cloud computing services, driven by the growing need for scalable data centers that can handle the growing complexities of a modern digital enterprise. Then the rise of cloud computing wrought a complementary type of data center known as a colocation, or a method of outsourcing data centers where the provider sells space in its data centers by contract.One company that provides colocation services is Interxion Holding (INXN), which has seen a 71% rise in its stock price over the past 12 months. It's the second-largest provider of colocation services in Europe, behind market leader Equinix (EQIX).""The trend among companies is to move away from owning and running their own data centers,"" said John Dinsdale, research analyst at Synergy Research Group. ""Running data centers is often viewed as an expensive and time-consuming distraction.""Interxion has more than 1,600 customers and about 49 data centers across 11 European countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. It offers equipment space for servers and storage, and also provides the power and cooling systems designed for smooth running. Customers typically pack the warehouse-size data centers with their own computer servers and other gear.The broad picture is that data-center outsourcing and the ongoing surge in cloud services continue to drive the colocation market, said Dinsdale. This growth is funneled from cloud providers and lifted as well by enterprise technology spending.Amsterdam-based Interxion is a long way behind market leader Equinix, but it's also far ahead of the other major colocation providers. In January, Interxion announced its largest facility expansion to date, adding colocation facilities in seven European cities.""The increased pace of cloud adoption combined with an improving economy in Europe continues to drive broad-based demand for our colocation services across our entire footprint,"" Interxion Chief Executive David Ruberg said in prepared remarks announcing the expansion.When combined with previously announced expansion projects, Interxion has active projects that will increase the company's equipped space by more than 25% compared with the end of the third quarter.Many enterprises are partnering with colocation providers to support growth initiatives. Rather than expand their company-owned data centers, they are turning to colocation providers to reduce costs and increase sales. Colocation helps them to mitigate risks, scale faster, and reduce capital and operating expenditures.Interxion's colocation facilities connect to a broad range of telecommunications carriers, Internet service providers, and most leading cloud and digital media platforms. Among the cloud platforms it connects with are Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure.As consumption of data increases on mobile devices, cloud computing continues to grow and new technologies like artificial intelligence increase in size, demand for infrastructure and services provided by Interxion will keep the company moving forward.RBC Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Atkin in a recent research note to clients said cloud computing growth continues to be a key driver for Interxion.IBD'S TAKE: Interxion has a IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99, and is trading comfortably above its 50-day moving average, which is a positive indicator. It also has a Relative Strength rating of 89, meaning it tops 89% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength.""Interxion's pan-European portfolio has benefited its growth profile, as it has enjoyed growth at different times in markets at varying stages of cloud adoption,"" Atkin wrote.The business outlook for colocation operators is strong. Synergy Research's Dinsdale estimates the market for data-center colocation services will top $62 billion by 2022, nearly double its $31.5 billion size last year, for a compound annual growth rate of about 15%. Research firm IDC says that 53% of European businesses currently use or plan to build a hybrid cloud solution.In addition to Interxion and Equinix, other colocation providers include Digital Realty (DLR) and DuPont Fabros Technology. Others include CoreSite Reality (COR) and CyrusOne (CONE).In the third quarter, Interxion showed revenue growth of 25% to $147.4 million from the year-ago period, with adjusted earnings rising 38% to 18 cents a share. Recurring revenue in the third quarter represented 94% of total revenue.On the company's earnings conference call, Ruberg said the demand from cloud computing vendors is strong and coming from multiple providers, which he said was ""in line with our strategy and our expectations.""Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan, following Interxion's January expansion announcement, reiterated a buy rating on Interxion and raised his price target to 68, from 62.""Interxion announced the largest capacity expansion in its history, evidence that demand across Europe is intensifying,"" Horan wrote in his research note.For a variety of reasons, said Synergy Research's Dinsdale, the colocation market is heavily focused around key metropolitan areas. Just four of those regions — London, Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam — account for almost half of the total European market.""Interxion is well positioned in those metro markets, being a top five player in Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt, and a top ten player in London. It is also well positioned in some secondary key metros such as Zurich and Dublin,"" Dinsdale said.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Cloud Services Drive New Data CentersIBD Rating Upgrades: Equinix Flashes Improved Technical Strength

2,DLR,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

20,DLR,"The wealth manager to Facebook (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg and other technology entrepreneurs is starting a unit to invest in data centers to profit from growing demand for cloud-based services.Iconiq Capital, the San Francisco-based investment advisor run by Divesh Makan, registered a new subsidiary with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month that will put client funds into technology-related real estate, according to documents filed with the agency. Its holdings will range from direct investments in data centers to securities issued by real estate investment trusts specializing in the sector.Facebook, the world's largest social-media company, and other technology giants have already spent billions of dollars building data centers to provide cloud-based computer services to individual customers, according to Anand Srinivasan, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. That spending pales in comparison to the amount of funding that will be required as global corporations turn to the cloud to meet their computing needs.""We are just scratching the surface on the large data center expansion trend,"" Srinivasan said. Iconiq, in starting a fund to invest in data centers, ""has definitely picked up on a trend.""The demand for additional capacity has already fueled a surge in the market value of publicly traded tech companies and REITs that own and operate data centers. A basket of seven data-center stocks, including Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX), has jumped about 30% this year, according to recent data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a gain of around 7% by the S&P 500 Index.""The public REITs in the data-center space have been the best-performing sector of stocks in the past eight months,"" Jerald Kent, chairman of TierPoint, a closely held provider of cloud-computing services, said in a telephone interview. ""Historically, they are trading at very robust multiples,"" said Kent, whose St. Louis-based company owns 39 data centers.Iconiq referred calls to an outside spokeswoman, who declined to comment. The firm is owned by Makan along with partners Chad Boeding, Michael Anders and William Griffith.Iconiq opened in 2011, the year before Facebook held its $16 billion initial public offering, the biggest ever by a U.S. technology company. Before starting the firm, Makan, Boeding and Anders all worked at Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), two of the main underwriters for the Facebook IPO.As a multifamily office, Iconiq focuses on providing wealth-management services to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. It had about $16.7 billion of assets under management at the end of last year, including $4.8 billion in discretionary accounts. According to regulatory filings, clients include Sean Parker, the co-founder of Napster; Reid Hoffman, the chairman of LinkedIn (LNKD); and Zuckerberg, who at age 32 ranks as the world's fifth-richest person with an estimated net worth of more than $57 billion, mostly in Facebook stock.While Iconiq primarily helps clients allocate their money to outside hedge and private equity funds, the firm also runs its own proprietary investment vehicles. On Aug. 8, it completed the registration process for Iconiq DC Management, the subsidiary setting up private funds to make real estate investments in data centers or ""technology connectivity-related assets,"" according to the SEC filing.The new money manager is organizing its first fund, the filing shows. Once it has raised capital, the funds will make direct investments in property, sponsor or invest in REITs, provide mortgage financing and form joint ventures with other investors.""Given Iconiq Capital's broad relationships with some of the world's leading technology companies and innovators,"" the unit is ""able to access proprietary market insights unavailable to most sponsors"" of investment funds, Makan's firm said in the filing.RELATED:In Hot REIT Space, Data Centers Seen Having An AdvantageFacebook, Microsoft Capital Spending Good For Data Center REITsData Center REITs Hit New Highs As Cloud Expands

25,DLR,"Charter Communications (CHTR) stock fell Monday after the soon-to-be No. 2 cable TV firm was not added to the S&P 500, as some analysts and investors had expected, following the final approval of its Time Warner Cable acquisition.Standard & Poor’s announced late Friday that Digital Realty (DLR), a data center operator whose stock has been rising of late, would replace Time Warner Cable in the S&P 500.Digital Realty will take TWC 's place on the index after the close of trading on Tuesday. Charter expects to close its purchases of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks on Wednesday, after gaining the final regulator OK on Thursday. It will then become the No. 2 cable company, behind Comcast (CMCSA).Equinix (EQIX) early Monday announced that it will sell eight European data centers to Digital Realty for $874 million. Regulators required Equinix to divest some assets in approving its acquisition of Telecity. The eight data centers consist of five in London, two in Amsterdam and one in Frankfurt.Shares of Digital Realty, which announced an equity offering to fund the Equinix deal, were up 2.5% early Monday, near 96 and touching an all-time high for the sixth day in the past eight trading days. Digital Realty stock is up 25% this year.

26,DLR,"In their Q1 earnings reports, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big Internet companies have signaled continued strong spending on cloud infrastructure -- and that bodes well for data center operators, says Pacific Crest.“The five largest cloud companies (Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Facebook (FB) and Apple), which account for 80% of the capital investments by top-20 cloud companies, showed an acceleration in capital investments during Q1,” Brent Bracelin, a Pacific Crest analyst, said in a research report.Data center operators have been among the best-performing real estate investment trusts in 2016. REITs are essentially portfolios of income-producing properties. They bypass the standard corporate income tax obligations by distributing at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends.Among the top data center companies, Equinix (EQIX) reports Q1 earnings on Wednesday after the close, while CyrusOne (CONE) reports on Thursday.Equinix stock, which has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 64, is up 9% in 2016. But CoreSite Realty (COR) stock has shot up 32% and leads its group with a highest-possible CR of 99. DuPont Fabros (DFT) is up 25%, while Cyrus One has jumped 17%. Digital Realty (DLR), meanwhile, has climbed 16%.Still, IBD's 50-company Finance-Property REIT group overall is up just 3% this year and ranks No. 53 out of 197 groups tracked.Bracelin said Facebook’s capital spending jumped 125% to $1.1 billion. Microsoft’s capital spending rose 66% to $2.3 billion, while Amazon.com’s increased 35% to $1.2 billion.“Because many of these cloud operators use custom software and white-box infrastructure, there are few direct beneficiaries across the traditional technology landscape beyond some of the data center REITs,” said Bracelin.

28,DLR,"When QTS Realty Trust (QTS) opens its newest so-called data center in downtown Chicago later this year in a former Chicago Sun-Times printing plant, it expects little trouble filling the space.Unlike a shrinking newspaper industry, data centers are enjoying a secular upswing, thanks to cloud computing, mobile devices, streaming and the Internet of Things. These warehouse-like buildings contain computer servers and other gear used to power websites and store information for a variety of businesses in the digital age.""Other (Chicago data center) facilities downtown are highly utilized. There is not a lot of space left,"" Jeff Berson, QTS chief investment officer told IBD. ""We have a tremendous amount of interest and are actively engaged with a number of (potential) customers.""QTS's data-center customers are largely skewed to financial services, technology, health care and retail, he says. The company keeps their identities confidential, alluding to them in general terms for the most part, such as ""a large Internet company"" or ""global bank."" Berson says two of the big accounting firms are customers, as well as one of the largest cloud companies and software-as-a-service tech firms.""One Internet customer pays them $35 million a year in rent,"" analyst Jordan Sadler of Keybanc Capital Markets told IBD, citing a reference from a company filing.According to the Atlanta Business Chronicle, Twitter (TWTR) has taken a large amount of space at QTS's Atlanta data center. Asked if this was true, Berson said, ""I can't comment.""Based in suburban Kansas City, QTS Realty may be the smallest of six publicly traded real estate investment trusts, or REITs, that focus on data centers. But it has plenty of available space and is adding more of it, which gives it an edge over its bigger rivals, says Sadler.Those rivals include large-cap firms Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Realty Trust (DLR); as well as smaller companies CyrusOne (CONE), DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT) and CoreSite Realty (COR).""Right now, demand is strong, and availability across the entire space is dwindling,"" Sadler said. ""Having space to lease at a time when demand is spiking is a good thing. Some companies are out of space.""QTS offers big blocks of wholesale space under long-term contracts, as well as smaller retail locations with shorter-term contracts. In addition, it provides managed services and cloud offerings in both settings. It operates 24 data centers, most of them in the U.S. Several are sprinkled outside the U.S. -- in Canada, Europe, Hong Kong and Sydney, Australia.""We see a lot of companies in the sector offering just one of those,"" Berson said. ""Offering three as opposed to just one is an important differentiator for us.""Eight of the firm's data centers are owned outright, including the former printing plant in Chicago that it purchased for $18 million in 2014.""We think it was at a significant discount in terms of what the Chicago Sun-Times had invested in the facility,"" Berson said. ""More important, it gives us a building that can support over 130,000 square feet of saleable data-center space.""And since it also comes with 30 acres of land, QTS can more than double that capacity, Berson says.Around 90% of the company's total capacity comes from its fully owned data centers, Berson says. They include several large mega centers -- two in the Atlanta area; Dallas; Princeton, N.J.; and Richmond, Va.; with Chicago coming online in the third quarter. The usable leasing space at those centers ranges from more than 100,000 square feet to 556,000 square feet, the latter in its Richmond center.""If you're running larger facilities, you can bring in more customers and revenue on fixed costs,"" Berson said.Before they were developed into data centers, QTS's Richmond and Dallas locations were originally semiconductor manufacturing plants and were purchased at discounts, Berson says.The rest of the company's locations are leased, including 14 small centers that came by way of last year's $326 million acquisition of Virginia-based Carpathia Hosting, a provider of cloud and infrastructure services to enterprise and government customers.""We bought Carpathia because it supported the service side of our business,"" Berson said, adding that it contributes about $90 million a year in revenue. ""When you sell a lot of services, you can get more revenue per square foot.""Services accounted for a little over 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter, while retail ""co-locations"" generated 45%, followed by large wholesale spaces at 35%.Total revenue in the quarter jumped 55.6% to $92.7 million. For the full year, revenue rose 42.8% to $311.1 million, helped by the Carpathia acquisition, strong growth in Dallas and new business at overseas locations. QTS reported fourth-quarter funds from operations -- essentially earnings in the REIT universe -- of $31.5 million, or 65 cents a share, up 17.3% from the earlier year.The company plans to spend $300 million to $350 million this year on data-center development, placing around 125,000 square feet of selling space into service, including Chicago. It forecasts operating funds from operations of $2.54 to $2.64 a share this year, up from $2.29 in 2015.Leasing volumes picked up in the fourth quarter, following a slower-than-usual third quarter, with $9.8 million in incremental annualized revenue, up 16% from the earlier year's annualized average. Excluding a $2 million downgrade by one unnamed customer, net leasing activity would have been up 40% over the prior four-quarter average.""It was good to see QTS demonstrate that Q3 (leasing) results were an anomaly, not a trend,"" said analyst Jonathan Petersen of Jefferies in a recent note to clients. ""We have renewed confidence in QTS's ability to achieve attractive (funds from operations) per share growth as the company builds out existing shells.""Of the 2.2 million square feet of real estate in its portfolio, including Chicago, QTS has developed 1.1 million of it, which includes power and cooling. To develop the remaining 1.1 million square feet would cost about $1 billion, Berson says.""We believe that is below market cost because we already have the buildings, and the capacity from 1.1 million square feet to 2.1 million can support our growth for another five years,"" he said.

Data center operators -- including DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT), Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and CoreSite Realty (COR) -- are among the top performers in IBD’s Finance-Property REIT group. It’s ranked No. 46 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Many data center operators are real estate investment trusts.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are among tech companies expanding data centers.Data center operators provide space, power and cooling. Customers pack the warehouse-sized data centers with their own computer servers and other gear. The data center market has been divided among wholesale providers -- such as Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros -- and retail operators such as Equinix (EQIX), though some lines are blurring.CyrusOne stock was up a fraction in midday trading in the stock market today, above 42, but earlier rose nearly 5% to 43.42, its record high. Shares have gained nearly 13% in 2016.At its investor day event, CyrusOne said that it aims to double its enterprise value from around $4 billion to $8 billion by 2020, said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., in a research report.“The company plans to achieve this goal by doubling its revenue, EBITDA and normalized FFO from 2016 to 2020 while being prudent to maintain (debt) leverage at 4.5 times or less, so that it can achieve an investment grade credit rating over that period,” added Synesael.REITs use a cash flow metric called funds from operations, or FFO.DuPont Fabros stock has shot up more than 25% this year, while CoreSite has gained about 20%. Digital Realty is up 15%. Equinix, part of IBD’s Internet-Infrastructure Solutions group, has gained 5%.Capital spending has been rising at data center operators. DuPont Fabros, aiming to raise $275 million, announced a stock offering on March 17.“New leasing volume suggests that demand remains robust and should support DFT’s growth plans with low leverage,” said Barclays analyst Ross Smotrich in a report. “However, the trade-off is that DFT had made it abundantly clear at their November 2015 investor day that their growth strategy would not include new equity. When future capital needs arise, therefore, investors may anticipate an equity raise.”Image provided by Shutterstock.

Shares of Redwood City, Calif.-based Equinix edged up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, near 302.Pacific Crest analyst Michael Bowen said the company's acquisitions of Europe-based Telecity Group and Japan-based Bit-isle in 2015 will expand Equinix’s reach.“The magnetic pull Equinix has been able to achieve by having a dense global footprint of data center assets cannot be ignored. No other data center company in the world can offer equivalent scale of interconnection services as Equinix,” Bowen wrote.Data center operators provide space, power and cooling. Customers pack the warehouse-sized data centers with their own computer servers and other gear. Equinix also specializes in providing connections to high-speed, fiber-optic networks.Demand for data-center space has been driven by the rise of social networking, mobile devices, cloud services, online gaming, computer-based stock trading and more. Equinix’s customers include leading cloud computing services providers Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as other large companies.“Equinix  is the only company that can enable enterprise adoption of the cloud, since it has created an ecosystem in which service providers can connect with enterprises,” added Bowen. “The ecosystem should be very difficult to replicate, and interconnection is one of the keys to Equinix's success.”The data center market is divided among wholesale providers such as Digital Realty (DLR) and DuPont Fabros (DFT) and retail operators such as Equinix.

"
102,DLR,"It's been a fruitful year for WisdomTree Investments (WETF), the nation's fifth-largest ETF sponsor. The company recently reported total Q3 revenue of $47.1 million, up 19% from a year ago.
"
103,DLR,"CEO and President Jonathan Steinberg discusses with IBD the positive momentum that drove this performance, industry trends and what lies ahead.
"
104,DLR,"IBD: WisdomTree describes itself as a self-indexing pioneer. What does that mean and how does it benefit investors?
"
105,DLR,"Steinberg: WisdomTree was the first ETF sponsor to create its own indexes and to launch ETFs based on those indexes, as opposed to licensing third-party indexes that others have created.
"
106,DLR,"That has a few benefits to investors. The first is, we have created a unified approach. For example, our equities are fundamentally weighted; sometimes you call that smart beta. There's a consistency to the methodology.
"
107,DLR,"The other difference is when you are an active mutual fund shop, you have portfolio managers. When you are an ETF sponsor, you really just have an index. But when you create your own indexes and have your own internal research department, you can own the story more. We are able to communicate more closely to our customer in what markets does this work, how do you fit these strategies more broadly into your portfolio, things of that nature. And it gives us the ability to not pay licensing fees, so it's a better business model. It allows us to always be differentiated, so that we have something that's more proprietary; it allows us to innovate. We like to consider ourselves the low-fee innovator in ETFs.
"
108,DLR,"IBD: What investing trends shaped your Q3 performance?
"
109,DLR,"Steinberg: The biggest trend was a strong dollar. That meant domestic equities contributed a lot. We have a new dollar fund, WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish (USDU), which was also very constructive. But probably the biggest was hedging out currency (risk) in our foreign equities. So two of our largest funds, WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity (DXJ) and WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity (HEDJ), they become a strong dollar play.
"
110,DLR,"IBD: You offer 14 actively managed ETFs. How do you view the SEC's recent approval of nontransparent, actively managed exchange traded mutual funds (ETMFs)?
"
111,DLR,"Steinberg: We consider transparency to be one of the core characteristics of our offerings. We think the existing investor base in ETFs truly appreciates transparency. So we think that though the Eaton Vance execution, the ETMF, may be an improvement on the mutual fund, it is not an improvement on the ETF. In fact, by launching ETMFs, Eaton Vance is highlighting some of the deficiencies of the mutual fund structure.
"
112,DLR,"It is not something WisdomTree is interested in pursuing. We think the existing user base wants the full functionality that today's ETFs offer: liquidity, transparency and tax efficiency. When you take away the transparency, you're reducing some of the intraday liquidity and the tight spreads. We can't see how it's in any investor's interest.
"
113,DLR,"IBD: In December 2013, you launched a suite of six fixed-income ETFs. How are they poised for a likely rise in rates in 2015?
"
114,DLR,"Steinberg: We launched four domestic fixed-income ETFs that should do well in a rising rate environment. What we've done here is hedge out duration risk. We have seen some early adoption to these funds — they have some $140 million in assets between them. We're well poised for the first time to compete in domestic fixed income, but it does need the right environment, which means rising rates. So it's still early days, but we feel good about our opportunity.
"
115,DLR,"IBD: Your average expense ratio of 0.52% is close to the industry average of 0.58%. Will WisdomTree slash expense ratios as other ETF providers have recently done?
"
116,DLR,"Steinberg: That's a little bit misleading. That's an asset-weighted number, meaning we are averaging 52 basis points across our $39 billion in assets. Thirty percent of our assets are in Japanese securities and another 25% of our assets are in emerging markets.
"
117,DLR,"Those markets tend to trade at a higher expense ratio than domestic equities because of complexity. So we have an unusual asset mix. Each fund we think is really appropriately priced within its market. The average that you referenced really takes into account the mix of our assets, which is very unusual for a U.S.-listed asset manager.
"
118,DLR,"IBD: What are your thoughts on the so-called fee war in the ETF industry?
"
119,DLR,"Steinberg: If you look at the history of indexing, when an S&P or MSCI or Russell is licensing indexes to asset managers, what happens is that more than one asset manager licenses an index. The only way to take market share is to cut fees. So there has definitely been a commoditization, particularly I would say in domestic large-cap, but also more broadly in cap-weighted equities. These commoditized indexes have seen some of the price war.
"
120,DLR,"IBD: What are your expected areas of growth going forward?
"
121,DLR,"Steinberg: It's more of the same. We will continue to launch more innovative products. As an industry, there's a lot of energy in ETFs, more than in hedge funds and in private equity or in mutual funds. Though the U.S. is by far the most developed (ETF market), Europe and Asia are also seeing growth in ETF investing increase dramatically. We expect that to continue.
"
122,DLR,"IBD: WisdomTree launched four ETFs on the London Stock Exchange on Oct. 24 after the April acquisition of London-based Boost. Do you have global ambitions?
"
123,DLR,"Steinberg: We have a couple of goals — not easy-to-obtain goals, but stretch goals. We have said we would like to be a $100 billion asset manager. We put that out when we were sub-$20 billion, and today we are $39 billion in global assets under management. Today we are the eighth largest ETF player in the world. We said we would like to be top five.
"
124,DLR,"So we have some growth ahead of us. That will include more growth in the U.S., but it will also mean some other geographies around the world. We have global aspirations for sure.
"
125,DLR,"IBD: Is there any ETF firm on the home front that would make a good fit for an acquisition?
"
126,DLR,"Steinberg: We can't talk about anything that's not been publicly announced. I do think you will see some corporate finance activity in our space.It's been a fruitful year for WisdomTree Investments (WETF), the nation's fifth-largest ETF sponsor. The company recently reported total Q3 revenue of $47.1 million, up 19% from a year ago.CEO and President Jonathan Steinberg discusses with IBD the positive momentum that drove this performance, industry trends and what lies ahead.IBD: WisdomTree describes itself as a self-indexing pioneer. What does that mean and how does it benefit investors?Steinberg: WisdomTree was the first ETF sponsor to create its own indexes and to launch ETFs based on those indexes, as opposed to licensing third-party indexes that others have created.That has a few benefits to investors. The first is, we have created a unified approach. For example, our equities are fundamentally weighted; sometimes you call that smart beta. There's a consistency to the methodology.The other difference is when you are an active mutual fund shop, you have portfolio managers. When you are an ETF sponsor, you really just have an index. But when you create your own indexes and have your own internal research department, you can own the story more. We are able to communicate more closely to our customer in what markets does this work, how do you fit these strategies more broadly into your portfolio, things of that nature. And it gives us the ability to not pay licensing fees, so it's a better business model. It allows us to always be differentiated, so that we have something that's more proprietary; it allows us to innovate. We like to consider ourselves the low-fee innovator in ETFs.IBD: What investing trends shaped your Q3 performance?Steinberg: The biggest trend was a strong dollar. That meant domestic equities contributed a lot. We have a new dollar fund, WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish (USDU), which was also very constructive. But probably the biggest was hedging out currency (risk) in our foreign equities. So two of our largest funds, WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity (DXJ) and WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity (HEDJ), they become a strong dollar play.IBD: You offer 14 actively managed ETFs. How do you view the SEC's recent approval of nontransparent, actively managed exchange traded mutual funds (ETMFs)?Steinberg: We consider transparency to be one of the core characteristics of our offerings. We think the existing investor base in ETFs truly appreciates transparency. So we think that though the Eaton Vance execution, the ETMF, may be an improvement on the mutual fund, it is not an improvement on the ETF. In fact, by launching ETMFs, Eaton Vance is highlighting some of the deficiencies of the mutual fund structure.It is not something WisdomTree is interested in pursuing. We think the existing user base wants the full functionality that today's ETFs offer: liquidity, transparency and tax efficiency. When you take away the transparency, you're reducing some of the intraday liquidity and the tight spreads. We can't see how it's in any investor's interest.IBD: In December 2013, you launched a suite of six fixed-income ETFs. How are they poised for a likely rise in rates in 2015?Steinberg: We launched four domestic fixed-income ETFs that should do well in a rising rate environment. What we've done here is hedge out duration risk. We have seen some early adoption to these funds — they have some $140 million in assets between them. We're well poised for the first time to compete in domestic fixed income, but it does need the right environment, which means rising rates. So it's still early days, but we feel good about our opportunity.IBD: Your average expense ratio of 0.52% is close to the industry average of 0.58%. Will WisdomTree slash expense ratios as other ETF providers have recently done?Steinberg: That's a little bit misleading. That's an asset-weighted number, meaning we are averaging 52 basis points across our $39 billion in assets. Thirty percent of our assets are in Japanese securities and another 25% of our assets are in emerging markets.Those markets tend to trade at a higher expense ratio than domestic equities because of complexity. So we have an unusual asset mix. Each fund we think is really appropriately priced within its market. The average that you referenced really takes into account the mix of our assets, which is very unusual for a U.S.-listed asset manager.IBD: What are your thoughts on the so-called fee war in the ETF industry?Steinberg: If you look at the history of indexing, when an S&P or MSCI or Russell is licensing indexes to asset managers, what happens is that more than one asset manager licenses an index. The only way to take market share is to cut fees. So there has definitely been a commoditization, particularly I would say in domestic large-cap, but also more broadly in cap-weighted equities. These commoditized indexes have seen some of the price war.IBD: What are your expected areas of growth going forward?Steinberg: It's more of the same. We will continue to launch more innovative products. As an industry, there's a lot of energy in ETFs, more than in hedge funds and in private equity or in mutual funds. Though the U.S. is by far the most developed (ETF market), Europe and Asia are also seeing growth in ETF investing increase dramatically.

266,DLR,"Data-center REITs will likely continue experiencing a boom market, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure. Also, the estimated growth rates for the artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality markets will remain robust over the next five-eight years.These factors, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, are anticipated to provide substantial growth impetus to data-center REITs, including Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report), Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), CyrusOne Inc. (CONE  -  Free Report) and CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), and others.Specifically, Digital Realty is poised to benefit from this strong demand for data centers through accretive acquisitions and development efforts. In September 2017, Digital Realty announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros, in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced the company’s portfolio in the top U.S. data-center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped the company enhance its hyper-scale product offering and grow Digital Realty’s blue-chip customer base.Recently, Digital Realty unveiled its third data center in Toronto. The move further expands the company’s presence in the fourth largest city in North America which is also the financial and business capital of Canada. Further, the company had acquired Telx in October 2015 and a portfolio of eight high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London) from Equinix in July 2016. Also, it has fortified its presence in Europe, Australia and Asia in recent years through development of high-quality facilities.The company focuses on maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. It enjoys ample and growing liquidity, with diversified sources of capital and has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Additionally, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Digital Realty remains committed to that. Much to the delight of its shareholders, on Mar 1, 2018, the company announced an 8.6% hike in dividend. The company has raised dividend every year since its initial public offering and the March 2018 raise marked the 13th consecutive year of increase.However, Digital Realty faces stiff competition in its industry. In fact, the company contends with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets at locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are multiple local developers in the United States and several regional operators across Europe, Asia and Australia.Given the solid growth potential of the data-center real estate market, competition is expected to intensify in the upcoming period from existing as well as new players. Amid all this, an aggressive pricing pressure is anticipated in the data-center market.Moreover, Digital Realty’s earnings have a notable exposure to foreign currency translation. Also, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. In fact, it has substantial debt burden. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate, and lower dividend payouts as well. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Shares of Digital Realty have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. The stock has gained 15.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 12.4%. However, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share remain unchanged at $6.55 over the past month.Digital Realty has a Zacks Rank #3(Hold).

Additionally, the figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $100.6 million.Quarter in DetailSame-Park rental income was up 2.4% year over year, while Same-Park NOI edged up 0.7% year over year, mainly driven by improving rental rates.Same-Park annualized rental income per occupied-square-foot rose 2.3% to $15.40, while weighted average square-foot occupancy was 94.6%, flat year over year.LiquidityPS Business Parks exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $39.2 million, down from $114.9 million at the end of the prior quarter.Portfolio UpdateDuring the first quarter, the company sold Corporate Pointe Business Park in Orange County, CA — consisting of five multi-tenant office buildings and aggregating 161,000 square feet of space — for net proceeds of $41.7 million.

268,DLR,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is bustling with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, of which Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report), Iron Mountain Incorporation (IRM  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Cubesmart (CUBE  -  Free Report) will release their quarterly numbers on Apr 26.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total Finance Sector earnings for the Jan-Mar quarter are expected to be up 27% on 4.7% increase in revenues, as compared to the prior-year quarter. In fact, the sector witnessed 0.6% earnings growth in the prior quarter, primarily due to 4% rise in revenues.Notably, with the underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind, this season.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Digital Realty Trust is a data-center REIT that offers colocation and interconnection solutions for domestic and international tenants through its portfolio of data centersNotably, data-center REITs have been experiencing a boom market, of late. Additionally, demand has been outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets. Other than enjoying high occupancy, these markets are also absorbing new construction at a faster pace. Further, according to a Cisco forecast, data-center IP traffic is projected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 25%, over the 2016-2021 period.Notably, Digital Realty, with its high-quality date centers, is well poised to benefit from this trend. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for occupancy of 90% for the first quarter indicates year-over-year growth of 1.1%.However, Digital Realty faces intense competition in its industry. In fact, the company competes with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are a number of local developers in the United States, and several regional operators in Europe, Asia and Australia. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is predicted to have been prevalent in the data-center market in the quarter to be reported. (Read more: Digital Realty to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Hence, prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at $1.57, over the past month.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, though Digital Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.25% makes surprise prediction difficult.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four occasions, the average beat being nearly 2.18%. This is depicted in the graph below:Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteIron Mountain’s focus on setting up data-center businesses bodes well for the company.  Internal storage rental growth rate for 2018 is expected in the 3-3.5% range, backed by volume growth and pricing improvement. We believe stellar organic growth and the company’s initiatives to expand its core storage business will benefit the first-quarter results.Nevertheless, Iron Mountain has grown its business principally through acquisitions, which have affected its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill. Hence, a highly leveraged balance sheet is predicted to have limited any robust margin improvement in the quarter. (Read more: What's in the Offing for Iron Mountain in Q1 Earnings?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 50 cents. This indicates a 4.2% increase year over year.Furthermore, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank of 2, our proven model does not conclusively show that the company will likely beat estimates this season. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The story about Iron Mountain’s surprise history is better told by the chart below:Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Iron Mountain Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Iron Mountain Incorporated QuoteKimco Realty is taking long strides, and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision. In fact, for first-quarter 2018, the company continued aggressively selling its non-core assets.In line with its strategy, the company announced dispositions of 21 shopping centers, spanning 2.3 million square feet of space, for $219.5 million in the first quarter. Of this, the company’s share included $210.2 million. High-disposition activity can lead to earnings dilution and depress the company’s growth momentum in the quarter to be reported.  While challenges faced by retail REITs have been well documented, recent data from real estate research firm Reis states that U.S. retail real estate vacancies remained moderately unchanged at 10% for first-quarter 2018. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporate.Although Kimco is actively enhancing omni-channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers, it might take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results. (Read more: Why is Earnings Beat Unlikely for Kimco Realty in Q1?)Although the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.51%, an unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) makes it difficult for our proven model to conclusively predict a likely earnings beat this season.Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteCubeSmart is a self-administered and self-managed real estate company focused on the ownership, operation, acquisition and development of self storage facilities in the United States.Notably, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.Nevertheless, increased supply of self-storage units in a number of the company’s markets during the Jan-Mar quarter is predicted to have affected its performance. This might have dampened its same-store revenue growth as well.  Amis these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues of $144.9 million indicates 8.9% year-over-year growth. Further, the company’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 39 cents for the first quarter remained unchanged, over the past month. The figure reflects 8.3% rise from the prior-year quarter.In fact, though it has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.37% makes surprise prediction difficult.Over the preceding four quarters, the company met the FFO per share estimates in two occasions and beat in the other two, resulting in an average positive surprise of 1.91%.

269,DLR,"Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter results on Apr 26, after the market closes.Last quarter, this San Francisco, CA-based date center real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 1.97%. Results were supported by growth in revenues and rental rates on renewal leases.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all four occasions, the average beat being nearly 2.18%. This is depicted in the graph below:Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderData-center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure remain primary catalysts.Additionally, demand has been outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. Additionally, according to a Cisco forecast, data-center IP traffic is projected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 25%, over the 2016-2021 period. Further, per Gartner’s report, worldwide IT spending is projected to increase 3.2% in 2018, while worldwide server shipments are expected to rise 3.5%. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers.Notably, Digital Realty, with its high-quality date centers, is well poised to benefit from this trend. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for occupancy of 90% for the first quarter indicates year-over-year growth of 1.1%.In addition to this, accretive acquisitions are likely to stoke the company’s top-line growth. On Apr 4, this REIT announced a partnership with the Singapore Internet Exchange. This move is aimed at providing local peering at the company’s Singapore data-center facilities in Jurong West and Loyang East. This move is a strategic fit as Singapore serves as the Internet gateway to Asian markets and hence, it will enable Digital Realty establish a strong foothold in the continent. Also, the company has been actively adding data centers to its portfolio. Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net rentable area at 26,780 million square feet compares favorably with the 22,680-million-square-foot portfolio which was owned by the company in the prior-year quarter.Furthermore, the company aims to have an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.31 as compared to the year-earlier quarter ratio of 4.2. This reflects higher solvency and efficient capital management.However, Digital Realty faces intense competition in its industry. In fact, the company competes with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are a number of local developers in the United States, and several regional operators in Europe, Asia and Australia. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is predicted to have been prevalent in the data-center market in the quarter to be reported.Hence, prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at $1.57 over the past month.Also, Digital Realty’s shares have declined 7.7% in the past three months, underperforming the 7.3% loss incurred by the industry. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty will likely beat estimates this season.

270,DLR,"Data Center REIT — Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) — recently announced a partnership with Singapore Internet Exchange (SGIX). The move is aimed at providing local peering at its Singapore data-center facilities in Jurong West and Loyang East.In fact, one of the largest internet exchanges in Singapore, SGIX enjoys peak Internet traffic of more than 150 Gbps. It will provide customers at Digital Realty's Jurong West and Loyang East Singapore facilities better and cost-effective connectivity choices. The consumers will benefit from SGIX's rich peering ecosystem, consisting of international and regional carriers.As a result, the partnership of Digital Realty with this open and neutral Internet exchange in Singapore seems a strategic fit. Particularly, Singapore serves as the Internet gateway to Asian markets. The region is fast growing and in fact, South East Asia is likely to upkeep 81 million people in its fast-growing cities by 2020.Notably, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, is triggering demand for data centers. Demand is outpacing supply in the top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets continue to randomly absorb new constructions at a faster pace. This, along with improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers.To capitalize on the trend, Digital Realty has resorted to accretive acquisitions, developments as well as strategic partnerships. In September 2017, the company announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros, in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped it upgrade hyper-scale product offering and grow blue-chip customer base. The company is also focused on expanding its footprint in Europe, Australia and Asia.Nevertheless, given the solid growth potential of the data-center real estate market, competition is expected to intensify in the upcoming period from existing as well as new players. Amid all this, an aggressive pricing pressure is predicted in this market.Digital Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(DLR  -  Free Report) — announced that for the 11th consecutive year it has achieved ""five nines"" of uptime, surpassing 99.999% availability throughout 2017. This reflects the company’s efficiency in developing and delivering data center solutions, which can be relied upon by customers.This operational excellence has been achieved despite growth of the company’s portfolio over the years, which expanded from 74 data center suites at the beginning of 2007 to more than 750 by the end of 2017.Moreover, recently, the company exceeded 1.7 billion operating minutes across its 205 data center properties. These properties included around 27 million square feet in 33 metropolitan areas internationally. The company noted that though hurricanes Harvey and Sandy left large regions without power, its data centers could uphold steady uptime.With projected growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a market boom. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in the top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the said markets continue to randomly absorb new constructions at a faster pace.

272,DLR,"Shares of data center REIT Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report) have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past month. The stock has gained 2% against the industry’s slip of 0.4%. The stock has still room for growth.  With projected growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data plus an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a market boom. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in the top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the said markets continue to randomly absorb new constructions at a faster pace. This, along with improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers. Amid these, accretive acquisitions and development efforts are expected to boost top-line growth for Digital Realty.In September 2017, Digital Realty announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped Digital Realty upgrade hyper-scale product offering and grow its blue-chip customer base.The company had bought Telx in October 2015 and a portfolio of eight high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London) from Equinix in July 2016. Such buyouts offered a leading colocation and interconnection platform, a superior connectivity infrastructure and better growth scope at attractive locations. The company is also focused on expanding its footprint in Europe and Australia.Further, the company aims at maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. It enjoys ample, growing liquidity with diversified sources of capital and has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule with no material maturities until 2020.Additionally, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Digital Realty remains committed to disbursing the same. The company’s dividend has witnessed a hike at 12% compound annual growth rate since 2005. Furthermore, much to the shareholders’ delight on Mar 1, 2018, it announced an 8.6% dividend increase. The company has annually raised dividend since its initial public offering and the recent March 2018 hike marked the 13th consecutive year of increase.However, Digital Realty faces stiff competition in its industry. In fact, the company contends with several data center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets at locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are multiple local developers in the United States and several regional operators across Europe, Asia and Australia.Given the solid growth potential of the data center real estate market, competition is expected to intensify in the upcoming period from existing as well as new players. Amid all this, an aggressive pricing pressure is anticipated in the data center market.Moreover, Digital Realty’s earnings have a notable exposure to foreign currency translation.

273,DLR,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Cousins Properties (CUZ  -  Free Report) recently announced an 8.3% hike in the company's quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 6.5 cents per share. The raised dividend will be paid on Apr 13, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Apr 3.Based on the increased rate for the first quarter of 2018, the annual dividend comes to 26 cents a share. At this new rate, annualized yield comes at 2.98% based on the stock’s closing price of $8.70 on Mar 19.We believe Cousins Properties has adequate capacity to support its enhanced dividend payout. In February, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 FFO per share of 15 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, the figure compared favorably with 7 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Quarterly results at this real estate investment trust (REIT) reflected a rise in second-generation net rent per square foot on a cash basis.Notably, Cousins Properties’ diversified portfolio,  presence of high-end tenants in its roster, opportunistic investments in best sub-markets and a conservative balance sheet keeps the growth momentum going. As such, the company remains well poised to boost shareholders’ wealth.However, the company faces stiff competition from other market players. This impacts its ability to retain and attract tenants at higher rents. Further, rising supply of office space and hike in interest rates remain concerns.In fact, solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. Apart from Cousins Properties, some other REITs, which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report) and Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report).Cousins Properties' shares have dropped 5% in the past three months, against the 5.4% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Cousins Properties currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Further, the JV will assume additional debt to raise funds.Specifically, termination of the subsea cables and connectivity to strategic cable landing stations (CLS) will take place directly into the facility. This will provide direct access, result in cost savings and higher performance and security for the company’s customers. Also, customers in the GCC and MENA regions stand to gain from the new data center by receiving dual access to content and cloud providers from other data centers in the region.   According to Eric Schwartz, president, EMEA, Equinix, “In the digital age, companies need to reach everywhere, interconnect everyone and integrate everything, and they need to do it out at the digital edge, where commerce, population centers and digital ecosystems meet. Our joint venture with Omantel will do exactly that.""With growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs like Equinix and Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report) are experiencing a boom market. Amid these, strategic measures such as data-center expansion, partnerships and buyouts assist the company to cater to the fast-increasing requirement of subsea cables.Currently, Equinix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy).Moreover, the stock has gained 9.9% over the past three months, versus the industry’s rally of 9.7%. Stocks Worth a LookA couple of better-ranked stocks from the same space are PS Business Parks (PSB  -  Free Report) and Columbia Property Trust, Inc.

275,DLR,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) is in discussion to acquire data-center firm Ascenty in Brazil, according to Bloomberg news. The company might make investment in Ascenty in conjunction with a joint venture partner.If the buyout of Ascenty materializes, which is presently owned by Great Hill Partners and a Blackstone fund, it will be a strategic fit for Digital Realty. The Brazilian data center firm has eight data centers in operation and six more in construction.Currently, its data centers are located in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Ceara. These are connected to a fiber optic network, spanning more than 4,500 km. Valued at more than $1 billion, Ascenty has a superior infrastructure, with redundancy, security and high connectivity, enabling it to have contracts with clients like Oracle Corp., Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report).Notably, data-center REITs are expected to continue experiencing a boom market with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure. Also, the estimated growth rates for the artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality markets will remain robust over the next five-eight years. These factors, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, are anticipated to provide substantial growth impetus to data-center REITs, including Digital Realty, Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), and others.Specifically, Digital Realty is poised to benefit from strong demand for data centers through accretive acquisitions and development efforts. In September 2017, Digital Realty declared the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced the company’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped it to enhance hyper-scale product offering and grow its blue-chip customer base.Moreover, the company acquired Telx in October 2015 and a portfolio of 8 high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London) from Equinix in July 2016. Such acquisitions offered a leading colocation and interconnection platform, superior connectivity infrastructure and better scope for growth in attractive locations. Also, it enhanced its presence in Europe, Australia and Asia in the recent years through the development of high-quality facilities. We believe that such expansion efforts would drive the company’s top and bottom lines in the years ahead.However, Digital Realty faces intense competition in the industry. Aggressive pricing pressure is also likely to continue in the upcoming period. Furthermore, it has a substantial debt burden, hence, rate hike adds to its woes.Currently, Digital Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

276,DLR,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) finally declared an increase in its first-quarter 2018 dividend. The company will now pay 54 cents for the quarter, which reflects a hike of 7.2% from the prior dividend of 50.375 cents.Notably, during the fourth-quarter 2017 earnings release, the company announced its decision to no longer fix the common share dividend as a fixed percentage of estimated normalized funds of operations (FFO). Rather, the company will embrace a more conventional policy that is based on actual and projected financial conditions, actual and projected liquidity and operating results, projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities. Therefore, with its development spend reduced substantially and solid growth in property operations, the company anticipates experiencing considerable increase in available cash flow in the near future.Based on the hiked rate of 54 cents for the quarter, the annual dividend comes to $2.16 per share. This new dividend will be paid on Apr 13, to shareholders of record on Mar 26, 2018. At this new rate, annualized yield comes at 3.62% based on the stock’s closing price of $59.72 on Mar 15.The company also announced that its Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on Jun 14, 2018 in Chicago, IL.  We believe Equity Residential has adequate capacity to support its dividend policy. Later this January, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 normalized FFO per share of 83 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The figure also came in higher than 79 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly results at this apartment real estate investment trust (REIT) mirrored enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. However, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Notably, Equity Residential has been making concerted efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets. It is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households. As such, we believe the company remains well poised to boost shareholders’ wealth.However, new apartment supply across Equity Residential’s markets might continue to put pressure on new lease rates, occupancy, retention and result in high concessions as well. Furthermore, rate hike remains another concern.Notably, solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. Apart from Equity Residential, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report).Shares of Equity Residential have outperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past month. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 3.0%, while the industry recorded growth of 2.2% during this time frame.

277,DLR,"Delighting its shareholders, retail REIT Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) has announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend. This is the company’s 96th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.95 cents per share compared with 21.90 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the dividend on Apr 13 to shareholders on record as of Apr 2. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.634 per share versus the prior rate of $2.628 per share.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company”. The April 2018 dividend payment not only marks its 573 consecutive monthly dividend payouts throughout its 49-year operating history, but also 82 consecutive quarterly increases as well as payment of more than $5.3 billion.In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Apart from Realty Income, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report).Realty Income is well poised to grow and reward shareholders backed by its superior business model. This freestanding retail REIT derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, its occupancy level has never been below 96%. For 2018 too, the company projects occupancy to remain at approximately 98%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth underlines limited operational volatility.The company continues to maintain a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Moreover, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Nonetheless, the company’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past month. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 4.4% while the industry inched up 0.6% during this time frame.

279,DLR,"In a bid to expand into the Croatian market, Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Zagreb-based Arhiv Trezor. The company has selected Arhiv Trezor for its expansion because the latter has a robust base of customers and enjoys a great reputation.The expansion into the Croatian market, with the acquisition of Arhiv Trezor, seems a strategic fit for Iron Mountain as this will enable the company to benefit from the rising record and information management business. Further, this will fortify the company’s presence within Southeastern Europe.Notably, as a result of the application of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, the requirements for data privacy and protection have become extremely stringent. This requires clients to associate themselves with companies who aid them in adhering to the rules, thus increasing business opportunities for companies like Iron Mountain.Arhiv Trezor, which is a leader in storage and management of records, digitization, protected information destruction and safe transportation, was founded in 2002. The company has also received ISO 9001: 2015 Certification for records and business documentation archiving in Europe.Per Ernest Cloutier, executive vice president and general manager, International for Iron Mountain, ""Acquiring a known market leader like Arhiv Trezor fits our strategy of seeking established local providers that share our commitment to service delivery, trust and security in markets with strong growth trends in information management outsourcing.""Iron Mountain has an aggressive acquisition strategy to drive growth of storage revenues. The company has not only gained new customers from these acquisitions but has also been able to expand operations in international regions such as Greece, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Australia, Turkey, India, Brazil, China, Colombia and Poland.The company completed the acquisition of Recall Holdings in May 2016, which has broadened its footprint.

280,DLR,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) recently unveiled its third data center in Toronto. The move further expands the company’s presence in the fourth largest city in North America which is also the financial and business capital of Canada.The latest 46-megawatt facility, situated on the former Toronto Star Printing Plant site at One Century Place in Vaughan, Ontario, enjoys proximity to downtown Toronto, major highways, and an international airport. With 23 computer rooms, this facility can house power capacities from one to three megawatts per room.The expansion in Toronto is a strategic fit for Digital Realty as the capital city is home to several financial and technology companies, as well as emerging tech start-ups that are making significant strides in digital transformation, and require reliable provisioning of IT services and capabilities. Ranking among the top technology clusters in North America, Toronto has more than 15,000 technology companies along the Toronto-to-Waterloo corridor.

282,DLR,"In a bid to expand into the Amsterdam market, Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) has acquired the Dutch EvoSwitch data-center business. The company shelled out €205 ($235) million for this acquisition which involved the purchase of EvoSwitch Netherlands B.V and EvoSwitch Global Services B.V. (EvoSwitch NL) in particular. The move comes after Iron Mountain’s expansion in London through data-center facility purchase from Credit Suisse in the past 12 months.The latest acquisition brings in 11 megawatts (MW) of existing data-center capacity in the Netherlands which happens to be fully leased. Moreover, there is an additional 23 MW expansion capability.  As a result, the total data-center portfolio capacity of Iron Mountain, now grows to more than 285 MW.The expansion into the Amsterdam market, which happens to be the second largest European data-center market, with the acquisition of EvoSwitch NL seems a strategic fit for Iron Mountain. Founded in 2007, EvoSwitch NL operates one of the largest colocation facilities centers in the Metropolitan Region Amsterdam (MRA).The MRA serves as a crucial node in the FLAP data-center market, i.e. Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and therefore, the acquisition of EvoSwitch NL significantly boosts Iron Mountain’s presence in the region. Particularly, two locations in the MRA join Iron Mountain’s portfolio with this acquisition.Further, the present campus of EvoSwitch NL already caters to more than 50 connectivity and telecommunication providers, together with internet exchanges, such as the Amsterdam Internet Exchange AMS-IX. Its customers base is diversified as well as global. Moreover, Leaseweb Netherlands B.V., (Leaseweb NL), a cloud hosting company operating in more than 30 countries, represents around 45% of EvoSwitch NL's contracted revenues under a 10-year lease agreement, and will become one of the top five customers of Iron Mountain data centers.Iron Mountain expects the transaction, including integration costs, to lead to modest dilution to AFFO of around 0.5% in 2018, but be accretive in 2019 following integration. Specifically, stabilized net operating income yield is estimated to be around 12-13% subsequent to build-out and lease-up of the expansion capacity at the EvoSwitch NL sites, while the present capacity is likely to generate annualized revenues of about $30 million at mid-50% adjusted EBITDA margins, the company noted.Importantly, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to spur demand for data centers and offer ample scope for growth to data-center REITs, including Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report) and Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report).Iron Mountain’s latest endeavors in this space also command appreciation and will likely boost its top-line growth by leveraging on the healthy fundamentals. In fact, aggressive acquisitions, along with diversified revenue base, a strong product portfolio and cost-cutting initiatives, bode well for long-term growth. Further, transformation initiatives and continued strong performance of its storage rental business are positives. However, heavy investments in setting up the company’s data-center business dampen its financials, especially as the company already has a highly leveraged balance sheet.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

284,DLR,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, recently Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report) announced that its board has approved an 8.6% hike in quarterly common stock cash dividend rate to $1.01 from the 93 cents paid earlier.The new dividend for the first quarter of 2018 will be paid on Mar 30 to shareholders of record on Mar 15, 2018. Based on this hiked value, annualized yield comes in at about 4.1%, considering Digital Realty' closing price of $98.20 on Mar 2.Notably, Digital Realty has a solid track record of enhancing shareholders’ wealth. The company has raised dividend every year since its initial public offering and the March 2018 hike marks the 13th consecutive year of increase.We believe Digital Realty has solid scope of generating steady growth in cash flow to support its dividend policy. Last month, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.55 which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52. The core FFO per share also came in higher than the year-ago quarter’s tally of $1.43. Results were supported by growth in revenues.With growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers. Amid these, accretive acquisitions and development efforts are expected to drive top-line growth.In September 2017, Digital Realty announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped Digital Realty enhance hyper-scale product offering and grow its blue-chip customer base.Further, the company focuses on maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. It enjoys ample and growing liquidity, with diversified sources of capital and has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule with no material maturities until 2020.However, the company faces intense competition in the industry. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is likely to continue in the upcoming period. Moreover, Digital Realty’s earnings have a notable exposure to foreign currency translation. Also, the company has a substantial debt burden. Further, rate hike adds to its woes.Digital Realty currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has depreciated 8.8% over the past year, outperforming the 9.3% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors. Apart from Digital Realty, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months include Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report).Note: Funds from operations (“FFO”), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

286,DLR,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Feb 15, after the market closes.Last quarter, this San Francisco, CA-based date center real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 1.34%. Results were supported by growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and met estimates in the other, with an average beat of around 1.69%. This is depicted in the graph below:Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderData-center REITs are experiencing a boom market amid growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure. This has been driving demand which is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets. Therefore, despite enjoying high occupancy, the top-tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Additionally, improved outlook for economic growth is anticipated to fuel demand for data centers. Amid these, Digital Realty’s focus on offering upgraded technology to entice clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to-be-reported quarter.In addition to this, strategic acquisitions are likely to aid the company’s top-line growth. Also, in September 2017, the company announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros. This buyout helped the company reinforce its hyper-scale product offering and widen the blue-chip customer base.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $729.3 million, indicating projected growth of around 49.8% year over year.However, Digital Realty faces intense competition in its industry. In fact, the company competes with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are a number of local developers in the United States, and several regional operators in Europe, Asia and Australia.Given the solid growth potential of the data-center real estate market, competition is expected to have been intense from existing players, as well as entry of new players. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is predicted to have been prevalent in the data-center market in the quarter-to-be reported, while robust growth in occupancy might remain elusive.Moreover, Digital realty has a significant number of properties situated outside the United States. The company is also considering making additional international acquisition. Although a sound global footprint helps the company meet rising data-center requirements of customers around the world, the process exposes the company’s earnings to foreign currency translation. Also, the hike in interest rate is a concern as the company has a substantial debt burden.Hence, prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the fourth quarter remained unchanged at $1.52 over the past week. However, FFO per share denotes a projected increase of 6.3% year over year.Also, Digital Realty’s shares have declined 12.5% in the past three months, underperforming the 10.7% loss incurred by the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

287,DLR,"Retail REIT — Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) — reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.47, meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted FFO per share also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $1.45.Results reflect growth in revenues. However, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse effect on its quarterly results.Total revenues for the quarter grew 9.7% year over year to $224 million. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $218.7 million.During the reported quarter, Federal Realty signed 91 lease deals for 344,768 square feet of retail space. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s overall portfolio was 95.3% leased compared to 94.4% as of Dec 31, 2016.For full-year 2017, adjusted FFO per share came in at $5.91, well ahead of the prior-year tally of $5.65. This was backed by 7% year-over-year growth in total revenues to $857.3 million.Quarter in DetailsOn a comparable-space basis, Federal Realty leased 300,511 square feet, at an average cash-basis contractual rent escalation of 15% and 27% on a GAAP basis.Same-center property operating income (including redevelopments) improved 2.6% year over year. However, excluding such properties, same-center property operating income improved 1.0%. As of Dec 31, 2017, Federal Realty’s same-center portfolio was 96.3% leased, rising from 95.9% reported in the year-ago period.Federal Realty exited 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $15.2 million, decreasing from $23.4 million at the end of 2016.OutlookFor 2018, Federal Realty issued its FFO per share guidance in the range of $6.08-$6.24. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $6.17, which is within the company’s guided range.Dividend UpdateConcurrently, Federal Realty announced a quarterly cash dividend of $1.00 per share. The dividend will be paid on Apr 16, 2018 to shareholders on record as of Mar 14.Our TakeFederal Realty’s portfolio of premium retail assets — mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles — along with a diverse tenant base, positions it well for decent growth.Nevertheless, decreasing footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers are likely to continue to hurt performance of this retail REIT. While the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties are a strategic fit for the long run, short-term impacts on earnings cannot be bypassed.Federal Realty currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

288,DLR,"HCP Inc. (HCP  -  Free Report) — a healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) — reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted of 48 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents. Comparable FFO as adjusted in the prior-year quarter was 53 cents per share.Results reflect a 1.2% increase in the three-month same-property portfolio (SPP) cash net operating income (NOI).However, the company generated revenues of $443.3 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $456.2 million. The figure also compared unfavorably with the year-ago number of around $540.0 million.For full-year 2017, the company reported comparable FFO as adjusted of $1.95 per share, down from $2.04 recorded in the prior year. Full-year revenues also dipped 13.2% year over year to $1.8 billion.Behind the HeadlinesHCP attained year-over-year three-month cash SPP NOI growth of 1.2%. Results were supported by 5.1% increase in life-science cash NOI, 2.6% growth in senior-housing triple-net and 2.1% rise in the Medical office portfolio. However, the positives were much offset by 8.3% decrease in senior-housing operating portfolio (SHOP) cash NOI.During the fourth quarter, HCP announced $424 million of acquisitions. Notably, the company completed the previously-announced $228 million acquisition of the Hayden Research Campus in the Boston life-science market.

Results mirror enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. Nonetheless, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Moreover, total revenues in the reported quarter came in at $633.0 million, up 4.8% from the prior-year tally.

Also, expense is projected to flare up 3.5-4.5%.Our ViewpointEquity Residential is expected to benefit from its efforts to reposition the portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation, and creation of new households. The company’s current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in the six core coastal metropolitan areas — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle.

295,DLR,"Investors in the REIT space are usually jittery when a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve and there is no exception this time too. However, instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting, we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018, a positive revision in projected inflation and expectations of a “strong” job market.This can be far more rewarding because REITs business usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and job scenario. And why not? A fatter purse obviously gives tenants more power to demand real estate space and shell out for higher rents.More importantly, the technology wave is not only helping tech companies but is also driving demand for the related real estates. Take for example the e-commerce boom that has hugely affected retailers’ business model.No doubt, this has adversely impacted mall traffic in recent times, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, this technological evolution is changing the dynamics of the real estate market and substantially driving up demand for space at a number of asset categories.In fact, right from the time we use our smartphones, tablets or computers for a purchase, demand for REITs get a boost. This is because as we place our demand, the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers. Finally, the order is fulfilled through the industrial/logistics facilities and delivered at our doorstep.Now, REITs happen to own many of these cell towers, data centers and logistics facilities. So without the offering of this critical infrastructure, the e-commerce value chain simply cannot sustain.Along with making purchases online, an increasing number of people are consuming digital content. Going by numbers, per a forecast from Cisco, from 2016 to 2021, global Internet video traffic and mobile data traffic are estimated to witness a CAGR of 31% and 46%, respectively.The estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years. All these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower REITs including American Tower (AMT  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International (CCI  -  Free Report) and data-center REITs such as Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty (COR  -  Free Report) and others.Moreover, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options. This is propelling demand for distribution facilities near population centers, which not only help in lowering delivery time but also reduce cost of delivery.Further, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. As such, demand from the e-commerce sector has been escalating and per a report by Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report), in third-quarter 2017, this sector accounted for nearly 25% of total U.S. leasing demand compared with 14.7% in the previous year.This is offering significant impetus for growth to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) and others. So shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice.Therefore, instead of being bogged down by the current rate hike news, tap the many novelties in the REIT sector. Since individual market dynamics play a critical role in determining performance of REITs, favorable conditions only pump up chances of further growth.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

299,DLR,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies offering high dividends.JPMorgan U.S. Dividend ETF JDIV tracks the JP Morgan US Dividend Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility and yield. It has AUM of $25.2 million and seeks to provide exposure to higher-yielding equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in Dowdupont Inc DWDP, Hollyfrontier Corp (HFC  -  Free Report) and Digital Realty Trust Inc DLR, with 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all just a little over 7.5% is allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Utilities, Financials and Consumer Goods, with 15.9%, 15.0% and 14.2% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017).Market ImpactMoreover, markets anticipate an interest rate hike in the December meeting of the Fed. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 91.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike and 8.5% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike in December. This fund is expected to be significantly impacted because higher interest rates reduce the appeal of dividend-focused funds. However, Janet Yellen has warned that faster rate hikes might cause inflation to go below the Fed’s 2% target. Moreover, newly elected Fed chair, Jerome Powell, is seen as a dovish lead, who will not steer much from the current policy.There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s tax reform and deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to dividend-focused funds.CompetitionThe fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space.

300,DLR,"Broader macroeconomic concerns as well as a rise in Treasury yield have affected returns on REIT stocks in recent months. However, the operating performance of this special hybrid asset class was decent in the third quarter.In fact, per a NAREIT media release, occupancy rates reached a record high in the third quarter, while funds from operations (“FFO”), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, reported growth from the year-ago period.Specifically, the Q3 scorecard reveals that total FFO of $14.8 billion for the listed U.S. Equity REIT industry increased 7.8% year over year. However, the figure was 4.5% lower sequentially.Same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 3.2% year over year. Results were driven by segments like Manufactured Homes, Diversified, Single Family Homes, Industrial, and Data Centers, which witnessed robust same-store NOI growth of 7.1%, 7.0%, 6.8%, 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively.Importantly, properties owned by the listed Equity REITs enjoyed solid occupancy levels. In fact, the occupancy rate climbed 50 basis points to a record high of 94.0%.Notably, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies, but also driving demand for data center REITs. Moreover, the industrial asset category has hogged attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.The residential real estate market benefited from healthy demand levels and a delay in deliveries that kept the supply number at check. No doubt, shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, retail REITs managed to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and made their best efforts to replace with the ones which have departed.Among the S&P 500 REIT constituents, data center REIT — Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report) — and industrial REIT — Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) — delivered better-than-expected results in the quarter, with positive surprises of nearly 1.3% and 3.5%, respectively, in terms of FFO per share. Also, retail REIT, Regency Centers (REG  -  Free Report), and residential REIT, Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) surpassed estimates, registering a positive surprise of 4.4% and around 1.3%, respectively.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders. Dividend from Equity and Mortgage REITs aggregated $12.8 billion, denoting a 0.6% increase sequentially. Total dividends paid out were also up 4.1% from the prior-year quarter.Currently, Regency Centers has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Digital Realty, Duke Realty and Equity Residential carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

301,DLR,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) recently unveiled its second data center in Frankfurt, further expanding its presence in Europe.

303,DLR,"As we tread into another busy week of the current reporting cycle, a lot of activity can be noticed in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space. The Q3 earnings line-up for this week includes Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report).Improvement in the macroeconomic scenario has fueled demand amongst several asset classes in third-quarter 2017.Data-center REITs thrived amid growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure.As giant e-commerce chains continue to invade market share from physical retailers, greater inventory build-up and increasing focus on supply-chain efficiencies spiked demand for logistics infrastructure and warehouse facilities. This has driven the industrial real estate market’s growth during the quarter.Further, recovery in the economy and labor markets has resulted in increased manufacturing activities. This has helped warehouses and distribution centers enjoy higher occupancy and demand.    However, rising popularity of e-retail has become a key cause of concern for retail REITs. The increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon is putting pressure on the top-line figure for these REITs. Subsequently, the significant drop in mall footfall has compelled a number of retailers to opt for store closures and file for bankruptcy.Residential REITs enjoyed high occupancy rates and stable rent growth in the third quarter. Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Oct 25.Amid escalating demand for data centers, Digital Realty’s focus on offering upgraded technology to lure clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to-be-reported quarter.  In addition to this, the company is anticipated to ride on its growth curve backed by strategic acquisitions. We expect such diligent efforts to drive the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of $593.2 million indicates a year-over-year increase of 8.6%.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Digital Realty is -0.26%. Although the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.

Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteCommercial REIT Duke Realty has been putting in diligent efforts to lower its suburban office assets and turn the company into a leading domestic pure-play industrial REIT. Subsequently, in the second quarter, it sold its medical office building (MOB) portfolio for $2.8 billion. Part of the transactional proceeds will likely be reflected in the third quarter results.Amid an e-commerce boom, the company has made sound efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. While such streamlining efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact is expected to mar the company’s quarterly results.At present, Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -3.93%. Though the company has a favorable Zacks Rank, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.

The company has been purchasing premium assets in key U.S. markets and carrying out joint-venture buyouts.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of $294.8 million indicates growth of around 5.6% year over year.As part of its portfolio-upgrade strategy, Kimco is aggressively disposing non-core assets. While these efforts are encouraging for the longer run, the earnings dilution led by high-disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term. Therefore, these moves are expected to hurt the company’s growth momentum in the quarter to be reported.At present, Kimco has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Though the Zacks Rank is favorable, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.

It has a robust presence in around 39 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), located in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. Also, remarkable job growth in target markets is anticipated to keep demand for the company’s portfolio higher.MAA is expected to experience high occupancy and achieve stability. For the third quarter, the company projects FFO per share in the range of $1.39-$1.49 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same inched up 0.7% to $1.48 over the past week.At present, MAA has an Earnings ESP of +0.95% and a Zacks Rank #3.

304,DLR,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, this San Francisco, CA-based date center real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 3.36%. Results were supported by growth in revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions, met estimates in the other, and missed in another, with an average beat of around 1.18%. This is depicted in the graph below: Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderData center REITs are experiencing a boom market amid growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure. This has been driving demand which is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets. Therefore, despite enjoying high occupancy, the top-tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Additionally, improved outlook for economic growth is anticipated to fuel demand for data centers. Amid these, Digital Realty’s focus on offering upgraded technology to entice clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to-be-reported quarter.  In addition to this, the company is expected to ride on its growth curve backed by strategic acquisitions. In fact, it acquired Telx in October 2015 and a portfolio of eight high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London) in July 2016. We expect such diligent efforts to drive the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $593.2 million, indicating projected growth of around 8.6% year over year.Also, in September, the company announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros. This buyout helped the company reinforce its hyper-scale product offering and widen its blue-chip customer base.Nevertheless, Digital Realty faces stiff competition in the industry. In fact, the company competes with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in regions same as Digital Realty. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is likely to sustain in the data-center market, while robust growth in occupancy is anticipated to remain elusive.Hence, prior to the third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the third quarter remained unchanged at $1.49 over the past week.However, Digital Realty’s shares have rallied 25.6% year to date, outperforming 3.4% growth recorded by the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Digital Realty will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is -0.26%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Digital Realty’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

305,DLR,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Oct 24.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line results. Results reflected enhanced same-store and lease-up net operating income (“NOI”). Additionally, the company experienced lower corporate overhead. However, the company experienced adverse impact on NOI, primarily stemming from its 2016 huge disposition activity. Also, the company incurred higher interest expense in the quarter.Moreover, the company met estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company.Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise  Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise | Equity Residential QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Equity Residential prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderPer a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the earlier years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.For Equity Residential, things do not appear to be much favorable. In fact, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Moreover, the company made concerted efforts toward repositioning the portfolio from low barrier-to-entry/non-core markets to high barrier-to-entry/core markets, and opted for substantial sale out of its portfolio in recent years.Though the assets sale might enable the company focus exclusively on its core, high-density urban markets over the long term, the earnings dilution impact from such a move cannot be bypassed in the near term. These issues are expected to affect the company’s net operating income in the quarter to be reported.For third-quarter 2017, Equity Residential projects normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share in the range of 77-81 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 79 cents.Equity Residential’s activities during the quarter failed to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 60 days.Additionally, year-to-date, shares of Equity Residential have gained 2.7% year to date, underperforming its industry’s ascend of 5.4%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Equity Residential will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Equity Residential is -1.04%.

306,DLR,"Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) is anticipated to beat estimates in the third-quarter 2017 results, slated to be released on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, this self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered lower-than-expected performance, witnessing a negative surprise of 9.8%.The company has a mixed surprise history. In fact, it exceeded estimates in one occasion, met in another and missed in the other two, over the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 3.18%. This is depicted in the graph below:Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise  Public Storage Price and EPS Surprise | Public Storage QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Public Storage is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

The ‘Public Storage’ brand is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry. Further, the company managed to create a significant presence in the European markets through the Shurgard Storage Centers buyout.The company’s solid presence in key cities serves as a major growth driver. Also, acquisition and expansion initiatives are likely to stoke growth. In addition, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death and even divorce.Moreover, demand for self-storage space is expected to have got a boost following the hurricanes in the nation as people seek for safer place for their possessions, while they reconstruct their properties.As such, in the to-be-reported quarter, the company remains well poised to experience growth in revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $684.6 million, depicting projected growth of 3.2%. Particularly, same-store revenues are likely to increase, stemming from a rise in occupancy.Furthermore, in the past three months, shares of Public Storage gained 3.0%, outperforming its industry’s ascend of 0.6%.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +0.76% and a Zacks Rank #2.

This is depicted in the graph below:Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Realty Income Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Realty Income Corporation QuoteThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at 76 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderRealty Income’s portfolio is well diversified with respect to tenant, industry, geography and property type. It targets well located, free-standing, single-tenant, net-lease commercial properties. The company generates majority of its annualized retail rental revenue from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low-price point component to their business.However, the retail real estate market remained turbulent amid retailer bankruptcies and store closures. Moreover, competition remained solid in the quarter. In addition, the company has substantial exposure to single tenant assets which raises its risks associated with tenant default.Amid these, growth in same-store rent is like to be modest. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for rental revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $291 million, reflecting around 1% increase from the prior quarter.  Realty Income’s activities during the quarter failed to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter FFO per share remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Realty Income has lost 2.4% of its value year to date versus the 4.6% decline of its industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Realty Income will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.55%.Zacks Rank: Realty Income has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Although a favorable rank increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +0.76% and a Zacks Rank #2.

308,DLR,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) announced the extension of one of the two $1.25-billion revolving credit facilities through its operating partnership, Vornado Realty L.P. The extended credit facility will improve the company’s liquidity position.The debt, previously due in November 2018, is now scheduled to mature in January 2022. Two six-month extension options enable the company to stretch the maturities of the assumed debt.The arrangement has also enabled the company to access debt markets at favorable terms. The extended loan carries an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points (bps). It will replace the previous facility bearing a higher annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 105 bps. However, the facility fee remains at 20 bps.Nonetheless, the interest rate and facility fees on the other $1.25-billion credit facility of Vornado remain unchanged. The borrowing is due in February 2021 and carries two 6-month extension options.The inflated credit facility will complement the company’s efforts to expand its industrial portfolio. This, along with the company’s robust operating platform and strong balance sheet position, will likely help it execute strategic priorities, and drive net asset value and dividend growth.Vornado has been actively strengthening its balance sheet with the help of refinancing activities. Recently Vornado and SL Green Realty Corporation (SLG) closed a loan refinancing worth $1.2 billion for the Manhattan-based office building, 280 Park Avenue.The interest-only loan is slated to mature in September 2024, as extended, and carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.73%. It replaced a previous LIBOR plus 2% loan of $900 million, which was scheduled to mature in May 2023. (Read more: Vornado and SL Green Refinance $1.2 Billion Loan)These strategic efforts offer Vornado a cheaper line of credit and help reduce interest costs.

310,DLR,"The Minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which clearly signal a December rate hike, might keep investors in the REIT space worried. The Fed’s anticipation that the factors leading to a slowdown in inflation will eventually subside further enhances the chances of a rate hike.However, it won’t be prudent to brood too much on a rate hike. Rather, the focus should be on the expected Q3 financial results of REITs based on the fundamentals of asset categories to which they cater to. Here, we will tell you why:Forget Fed MovesNo doubt, for REITs, which depend on debt for their business and pay high and consistent dividend, a higher rate affects the present value of future cash flows. Therefore, asset valuation, including bond coupons and stock dividends, experiences a decline. But a rise in rates also lugs along scope for increasing future cash flows.In fact, any decision by the Fed to increase rate mirrors growth in the domestic economy and the central bank’s confidence in the recovery. When economic growth picks up and inflation rises, prices of real estate generally increase. Consequently, rent and occupancy of properties go up. As such, REIT’s earnings, cash flow and dividend get a boost.Focus on Underlying Asset StrengthsIn fact, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery, a number of asset categories displayed strength in third-quarter 2017. Take for example the industrial asset category that has grabbed attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.Moreover, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Also, the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report). For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.Pick Stocks Poised to Beat in Q3However, not all REITs from these asset categories are poised to excel. Therefore, in addition to focusing on REITs that have healthy underlying asset category fundamentals, investing in those that are yet to release their numbers and poised to beat expectations can be far more rewarding because an earnings beat essentially serves as a catalyst and raises investors’ confidence in a stock.Nevertheless, choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple, we rely on the Zacks methodology, which takes into account a favorable rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, denotes the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are five REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they release third-quarter results:Prologis Inc.

312,DLR,"Digital Realty Trust Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report), a data center real estate investment trust (REIT), is making efforts to expand its core business in the Asian markets on the back of strategic acquisitions and partnerships.The company pointed at the current fragmented market conditions to justify this move. Management anticipates that future market consolidation will bring efficiencies of scale and enable the company to capitalize on cost effectiveness.After fortifying its position in the U.S markets, the company intends to strengthen its base in the Asian markets of Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, as well as in Australia. Although it is the least developed of all other markets, there is growth in demand for data centers in Asia.

QuoteDigital Realty’s shares have rallied 14.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Digital Realty prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWith growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Moreover, improved outlook for economic growth is anticipated to drive demand for data centers. Amid these, Digital Realty’s focus on offering upgraded technology to entice clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, the company is expected to ride on its growth curve backed by strategic acquisitions. In fact, it acquired Telx in Oct 2015 and a portfolio of eight high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London) in Jul 2016. We expect such strategic efforts to drive the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.Notably, in Jun 2017, the company announced that it is set to acquire DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc.  in an all-stock transaction for an enterprise value of about $7.6 billion. The move would enhance Digital Realty’s portfolio in top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley.However, Digital Realty faces stiff competition in the industry. In fact, the company competes with several data center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in regions same as Digital Realty. Amid this, aggressive pricing pressure is likely to sustain in the data center market.Furthermore, per the management, second and third quarter results are anticipated to reflect higher property tax accruals, increased general and administrative expense associated with promotions, merit increases and timing of stock grants. Apart from these, it would bear the impact of settlement of the residual 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements the company entered into last May.Hence, prior to the second-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst.
