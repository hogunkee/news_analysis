0,DHI,"Treasury yields jumped Tuesday morning with a solid retail sales report, but the rout for both bonds and stocks gathered steam. The 10-year Treasury yield vaulted to 3.09%, the highest since 2011, while the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%-0.8%. Yet better economic growth should mean better earnings, so why did stock investors join in the sell-off?Here are 4 reasons why the market reaction raises concern about the outlook for stock investors:First, the obvious: Higher rates are a negative for interest-rate sensitive stocks, notably housing and autos. Big homebuilders Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI) were among the biggest losers on the S&P 500 on Tuesday.Next, the Fed: The rise in 2-year Treasury yields came as markets began to price in more-hawkish Fed policy. Now markets see a roughly 55% chance of a fourth 2018 Fed rate hike coming in December, up from less than 40% odds a month ago. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Tuesday that he sees three or four rate hikes in 2018 as the ""right direction.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Tuesday, 10-year Treasury yields rose even more than 2-year yields, steepening the slope of the yield curve. That's good for bank net interest margins and explains why Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) bucked the stock market downtrend and rose modestly on the stock market today.But, in general, banks have lagged the broader market in recent months as the yield curve has been getting flatter. The flat yield curve seems to reflect concerns that the Fed will overreact to strong growth fueled by a surge in federal tax-cut and spending stimulus this year. The Fed is seen as setting policy too tight once fiscal stimulus starts to wane, setting the economy up for a letdown in the second half of 2019.Third, rising U.S. interest rates have been accompanied by an upsurge in the value of the dollar vs. other major currencies. The U.S. dollar index rose about 0.5% on Tuesday, hitting a new high for 2018. The greenback is up about 5% from February lows. That's a pretty big negative for U.S. multinationals that derive much of their sales overseas, because those foreign sales are now worth less in dollar terms.A strengthening dollar is also a negative for the global economy because emerging-market economies often borrow in dollars. As the dollar rises relative to their home currencies, servicing dollar-denominated debt becomes more difficult. A higher dollar has added to Argentina's mounting problems.Fourth, higher U.S. interest rates are sapping demand for overseas debt at a time when U.S. borrowing needs are surging due to spiraling deficits and the Federal Reserve's unwinding of financial-crisis-era bond purchases. On Tuesday, bond yields rose across the world, not just in the U.S., which also crimps growths.The bottom line: Higher U.S. interest rates are tightening financial conditions around the world, a negative for earnings prospects at home and abroad.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Squeeze: New Risks For Fed Interest Rates, Recession And Yield CurveBond Markets Send These 2 Gloomy Signals On Fed Rate HikesThese 5 Top Stocks Falter After Their Breakouts Lacked ThisTrump Gave Up His Best Leverage In China Trade Talks — For Beans?

13,DHI,"The stock market held higher Friday afternoon, although gains were modest as Wall Street kept a watchful eye on the G-7 meeting in Canada.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.3%. Procter & Gamble (PG) extended gains. The consumer products giant has been rising since Thursday on word that a reorganization plan may be taking root. UnitedHealth Group (UNH), another Dow component, cleared the 250.89 buy point of a cup-type base. But volume was light.The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite 0.2%. Weakness in semiconductor and data storage shares contributed to the Nasdaq's slightly lower performance.Apple (AAPL), its biggest stock, gapped down after the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple has told suppliers to brace for about 20% fewer units of new model iPhones in the second half of 2018 compared with the same period a year ago.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSome Apple chip suppliers were sharply lower.  Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) fell about 3%. Analog Devices (ADI) and Qorvo (QRVO) dropped about 1%.Volume was tracking lower compared with the same time Thursday.Wall Street's focus was on the G-7 meeting in Canada. The gathering of major western leaders is expected to be frosty as President Trump presses allies to change trade policies. Trump added to tensions Friday, when he said Russia should return to the G-7. Russia was expelled four years ago in protest over its annexation of Crimea.Despite the market's gains, defensive sectors such as food, tobacco and alcoholic beverages were leading. But consumer stocks also led, with electronics stores, apparel and home furnishing groups among Friday's leaders.Homebuilders were one of the day's top performing industry groups, up 2%. The group has been a loser this year, but it's been bouncing modestly for a few weeks. IShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) — an ETF that also includes suppliers such as Home Depot (HD) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW) — was up 2%. It was one of the best gains among unleveraged ETFs.The homebuilding group is still near the bottom of IBD's 197 industry rankings. A few builders such as Tri Pointe Group (TPH) and Pulte Group (PHM) are forming the right side of bases. But it's too early to get excited about the group because most stocks remain deep in corrections. LGI Homes (LGIH), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Toll Bros. (TOL) remain deep in corrections.The energy sector lagged as oil prices fluctuated. U.S. crude was down after JPMorgan reduced its oil price forecast and concerns about growing U.S. output and falling demand in China, CNBC reported.

14,DHI,"Large caps are looking tired. A recent check of the Big Cap 20 found 16 stocks that were either late stage or too extended to buy.Leaders have plenty of reasons to be suffering from exhaustion. Yes, many stocks have had a long run, but success doesn't fully explain the tired look of the Big Cap 20. A fresh rotation of new stock names is supposed to keep the lineup at least interesting. But the new names aren't stepping forward to lead.Why is that?Part of the reason is that the expected leadership never won favor. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) made the Big Cap 20 at the start of the year. In late January, Horton reported quarterly earnings growth of 42%, the best in 10 quarters. But the stock kept falling in the weeks ahead. In late April Horton reported 52% earnings growth and then fell some more.When good earnings growth can't persuade either a stock or its group to advance, it's best to back away. Arguing with the market is folly. In this case, the whole industry went into a decline.Caterpillar (CAT) is another stock that made the Big Cap 20 in early January. Caterpillar reported quarterly earnings growth 160% in late January. The stock began a choppy consolidation after the results.Caterpillar is now about 11% off its high.Sometimes an out of favor old name can show new strength. In early January, Parker Hannafin (PH) raised that hope. The stock made the Big Cap 20. But the motion-control technologies provider couldn't overcome the market. The S&P 500 dropped about 12% in 10 sessions in late January and early February, and Parker Hannafin sank with the market.Big cap bank stocks were another group that garnered generous coverage but never delivered as expected.Earnings growth has not been a problem for most stocks. But the market has had trouble converting good news into stock gains.What's the other part of the problem?The other problem appears to be news-driven. The market's troubles began around the same time that President Trump slapped tariffs on solar panels and washing machines Jan. 22. The list of targets grew from there.Meanwhile, starting in November, China has had three waves of tariff cuts. This has not received much attention, but it could pay off for China.China has trimmed tariffs on avocados, mineral water, strollers, washing machines, refrigerators, cosmetics, drugs, shoes, kitchenware and fitness supplies. Some say the cuts are insignificant.But if those kinds of tariff cuts were to lead to reciprocal actions, the world economy would benefit. And the stock market would likely see some new leaders.RELATED:Like Your Stocks On The Trashy Side?

16,DHI,"Traders torched stocks today amid a bonfire of selling (with respects to the passing of novelist Tom Wolfe) in the U.S. Treasury bond markets. But a small posse of leadership-quality companies bucked the broad Wall Street decline.They included new IPO Altair Engineering (ALTR), Splunk (SPLK), Cree (CREE), Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and China Lodging (HTHT).In stocks today, homebuilders finished as the worst performer among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, down 5%, as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond hit 3.08%, marking a new six-year high.D.R. Horton (DHI) tanked more than 6% to 40.58 and dropped sharply beneath its long-term 200-day moving average. The stock is now 23% beneath a 53.32 peak. LGI Homes (LGIH), which staged a vicious reversal last week despite posting robust Q1 results (EPS up 112% to $1.10, sales up 71% to $279 million), took out its 200-day line as shares fell 5.9% to 58.19.LGI Homes' turnover jumped 149% above its 50-day moving average, a strong hint that fund managers sold anxiously.""Rising mortgage rates are further squeezing affordability for would-be homebuyers that are already frustrated by limited inventory of available homes and higher home prices that have resulted,"" Bankrate.com chief financial analyst Greg McBride said.On Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average both slid 0.8%; at one point, both averages fell more than 1%. The S&P 500 sank 0.7%. Volume increased on both main exchanges, according to early data. The higher volume vs. Monday's action implies unusually intense professional selling.As noted in IBD's The Big Picture column, such significant drops in heavier volume are called distribution. A bevy of strong distribution days can signal an end to a major market uptrend.Despite the broad decline among large caps, the Russell 2000 inched less than 1 point higher. The small cap S&P 600 also rose less than 1 point; at 982, the 600 is up 4.9% since Jan. 1 while the S&P 500 is up 1.4%. The IBD current outlook for the market remains ""Confirmed uptrend.""Meanwhile, Leaderboard member Apple (AAPL) staged a gap-down in price, but volume was well below the 50-day average. Given Apple's solid breakout last week, it's normal to see even top stocks pull back to or near the proper buy point.A downward gap appears on a daily chart when the intraday high is below the intraday low of the prior trading session.In Apple's case, Tuesday's intraday high of 187.07 is 79 cents below Monday's session low of 187.86. Not much of a gap.On May 4, Apple broke out of a compact double bottom base pattern that supplied a 179.04 buy point. So far, the breakout has produced a gain of more than 6%.At 186.26, the iPhone, iPad and digital services giant is now up 57% past a 118.12 buy point in a first-stage cup with handle, one of the most important chart patterns that top growth stocks produce before breaking out to new highs and big price runs. Apple cleared that base in the midst of its fundamental turnaround, on Jan. 6, 2017.Altair, a member of IBD's specialty enterprise software industry group, barreled more than 6% higher to 33.51 and narrowly eclipsed a 33.49 buy point in a seven-week cup without handle. The 17% decline within the base is bullishly mild. The Troy, Mich.-based expert in innovation-boosting engineering software went public at 13 a share on Nov. 1 last year.Notice on a daily chart how Altair has made a habit of breaking out of IBD-style bases, going up quickly in just a few days, then reversing sharply below the correct entry. But from a longer point of view, the small cap has done a marvelous job of staying on the north side of its 50-day moving average.Altair on Monday posted a 167% leap in Q1 profit to 8 cents a share as revenue rose 19% to $91.7 million, a quarterly best.Meanwhile, Ligand thrust higher for a fifth straight session, rising more than 2% to 185.37. The biotech play is extended 7.7% past a 172.17 entry in a well-formed double-bottom base.The midpoint of 172.07, found in between the two sell-offs within the base, is in the upper half of the base's price range. That's a good sign.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Ligand sports a shiny Composite Rating of 98 on a scale of 1 to 99. This rating, found only in IBD Weekly and at Investors.com, gauges a stock's corporate fundamentals, stock price strength, and quality of institutional sponsorship. It is not a purely technical indicator.Ligand's Relative Price Strength Rating is a stout 91, also on a scale of 1 to 99. This means the San Diego-based company is beating 91% of all publicly traded companies in IBD's database in 12-month price performance.In terms of market value, at $3.9 billion Ligand barely lifts a finger to the likes of Celgene (CELG), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Amgen (AMGN) in the biotech world. However, Ligand is body-slamming these three peers in terms of earnings growth. Ligand has grown profits 91%, 57%, 77% and 172% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings in Q2 rising 43% to 96 cents a share. Keep in mind, that's on top of the 91% jump in the year-ago quarter.Revenue broke the $50 million barrier on a quarterly basis in both the past two quarters. Year over year, the top line has boomed higher by 43%, 54%, 32% and 92% in the past four quarters.Read this recent New America feature piece on why Ligand is growing so rapidly.China Lodging, a major player in the fast-growing travel market in the Middle Kingdom, sprinted 9% to 169.50 in quadruple normal trade. The stock surpassed a 161 buy point in an unusual four-month double bottom. The RS line roared into new high ground.The proper buy zone goes up to 169.05, or 5% past the 161 entry.China Lodging posted a 79% jump in first-quarter earnings to 61 cents a share as revenue rose 42% to $332 million. After-tax margin climbed an impressive 310 basis points to 13.5%.The stock ranks No. 5 in the IBD 50.Keep in mind that China Lodging's recent base-on-base structure is at least fourth stage, which increases the risk of a breakout failure. The stock initially broke out of an 11-week cup base at 33.10 in the week ended March 18, 2016.However, some companies with stellar fundamentals defy the odds.(For the latest updates on this story and other market coverage, check IBD stories on stocks today.

The firm, which focuses on entry-level housing near major metropolitan areas, has a Composite Rating of 91. It is currently ranked first in the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group.

The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares.

23,DHI,"The 10-year Treasury yield hit 3% on Tuesday for the first time in more than four years, reflecting expectations that the Fed will hike its key rate four times in 2018. Stocks, which have struggled as Treasury rates have rallied strongly in recent sessions, sold off sharply yet again.Fed expectations are fluid. Around 10 a.m. Eastern Time, the CME Group FedWatch page showed roughly 53% odds of a fourth quarter-point rate hike coming in December, up from one-in-four odds after the deceptively strong March jobs report two weeks ago.But as the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones both closed 1.7% lower and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.3%, the 10-year Treasury yield pulled back to just below 3% and odds of a fourth Fed hike slipped to 39%.Bank stocks were among the better performers in afternoon trade on the stock market today. But Bank of America (BAC) reversed lower for a 0.4% decline as the market closed, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lost 0.5%. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are both still below their 50-day lines.Superregional Fifth Third Bank (FITB) surged 4.1% after soundly beating earnings estimates, but was well off session highs. West Coast-based Umpqua Holdings (UMPQ) gained 1.4%, extending its recent breakout.Bank stocks can see a big benefit from higher long-term rates if the spread vs. short-term rates widens. But the big move in the 10-year in recent weeks has seen narrowing spreads.While a higher 10-year Treasury means higher mortgage rates for home buyers, housing stocks got a lift initially Tuesday from strong earnings and housing data. Shares of PulteGroup (PHM) gapped higher on strong earnings, rising 2.9%, while Lennar (LEN) fell 1.7% and D.R. Horton (DHI) advanced 0.6%.March new home sales rose 4% to a 694,000 annual rate, well above the 630,000 rate expected and not far off November's 11-year high. Also, the Case Shiller 20-City Home Composite Price Index rose 6.8% from a year ago in March, the best gain since June 2014.Still, Tuesday's market action suggests, at least in the near term, that higher market interest rates may pose a hurdle for the S&P 500 and and the stock market generally as it aims to shake off the recent correction.Since jobs day, the Labor Department reported that core consumer inflation accelerated to 2.1% from a year ago in March. And now higher oil prices, which once again rose to their highest level since 2014 on Tuesday, could add to upward pressure on prices.At a minimum, the risk of another inflation undershoot has diminished. All the near-term risk is to the upside. That, in turn, could dampen demand for U.S. debt at a time when deficits are beginning to spiral higher and the Fed is curtailing its own holdings of Treasury and mortgage debt.In a Tuesday note, Lewis Alexander, Nomura's chief U.S. economist, projected that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, looks likely to rise to 2.3% by the end of 2019, up from 1.6% in February.Core PCE inflation for March will be reported on Monday, April 30.The Federal Reserve will meet on May 1-2 but isn't expected to hike rates again until the June meeting. Fed policymakers who want to move gradually but are concerned about the economy overheating will privately cheer financial markets moving proactively, essentially doing the Fed's work for it.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Not Just Apple: Treasury Yields Hit 4-Year High As Fed, Inflation Fears MountHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomThe Big Picture: Stocks Sputter As Indexes Struggle To Cross This Key LevelLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Horton, the second-biggest homebuilder by market cap, is down 18% so far this year, including Tuesday's dive. Lennar, the biggest by market cap, is off 16%.On Tuesday, the National Association of Home Builders reported that its housing index for May rose to 70. April's reading was 69, and analysts expected no change in May. The slight beat, though, had to contend with larger concerns about interest rates. (An index reading over 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as good compared with those who view them as poor.)The 10-year yield popped to 3.06%. The yield was at 2.46% at the start of the year. Higher interest rates are generally regarded as a negative for home sales.In terms of earnings and revenue, Lennar and D.R. Horton are doing fine.Lennar grew earnings 594% in its most recently reported quarter, topping views by 44%. Revenue growth stepped up from 12% to 28%.D.R. Horton boosted earnings 42% and 52% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters. Revenue growth accelerated from 11% to 15% to 17%.A stock's fundamentals alone can't guarantee price gains.

29,DHI,"Homebuilder stocks could be set to take another battering after an analyst warned of a slowdown in housing sales.XSpring selling season has got off to a weak start, a bad sign as it is a key period for the housing industry for both new- and existing-home sales.CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon believes the fact that home orders are not breaking new highs amid a strong economy could lead to lower revenue growth for homebuilders in the second half of 2018 and 2019.""While the spring selling season lasts through June, the data points we see so far are not encouraging,"" Leon said in a research note. ""In fact, the most recent releases confirm our key take-away that homebuilders are seeing higher pricing gains, but lower order unit growth.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The sector's recent struggles also saw LGI Home (LGIH) drop out of the prestigious IBD 50 stock list.However, D.R. Horton (DHI), due to its more diversified offerings and geographical markets, could flourish.Homebuilder stocks were the top market group in 2017, nearly doubling in value.

However, he is skeptical due to the late stage of the economic cycle.Government data suggest new-home sales are slowing down. In addition, confidence among homebuilders is falling, despite higher pricing gains helping to at least partially offset lower order unit growth.Mortgage rates are another headwind. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has hit 4.6%, an eight-year high.There is still a chance the booming jobs market could help buck the trend. Since President Donald Trump took office, the economy has added 2.7 million jobs, and since his tax cuts took effect there has been an average 200,000 new jobs each month. There has yet to be an accompanying jump in wages though.""Risks to our more cautious views on the housing market and new home starts would be strong job and wage income growth with mortgage rates flat to down, near 4.5%, in the next twelve months,"" Leon said. ""A slower rate of price increases would also be relief to affordability, especially in more expensive coastal markets like Seattle and (California).""And while homebuilders are skeptical, last month consumer confidence in housing was at an all-time high, according to Fannie Mae.The government-sponsored mortgage provider's Home Purchase Sentiment Index showed the confidence of those who think home prices will move even higher rose the most, while those who think it is a good time to sell came in second.The only group that reported a drop in confidence was those who think it's a good time to buy.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Analysts Bullish On Homebuilder Stocks Despite Dip — Here's WhyLGI Homes Crushed Earnings Views With Stock Already In Buy ZoneStill Bullish On Bitcoin?

37,DHI,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts.

Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off.

Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics.

Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion.

The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share. Vertex reported sales of $651.6 million and adjusted profit of 61 cents per share. AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share and $5.78 billion in sales.

Revenue also topped expectations, and management raised its full-year guidance to above consensus views. The stock has dropped below its 10-week moving average in a four-week decline, but remains extended from a September breakout.Shutterfly (SFLY) spiked more than 3% after reporting a huge jump in fourth-quarter earnings and revenue well above consensus estimates. The online photo-sharing site's first quarter revenue and earnings guidance were below expectations, but the company announced plans to acquire school portrait specialist Lifetouch for $825 million in cash.Shutterfly's gap up gain sent shares past a 53.98 buy point in a 21-month saucer with-handle base.Align Technology (ALGN) shed 5%.

But revenue came in light for the entry-home specialist.XKB Home shares jumped, trying to get above a key level. Other homebuilders rose modestly, even as new-home sales unexpectedly fell for a third straight month.Fiscal first-quarter earnings shot up 167% to 40 cents, crushing views for 30 cents. Net orders rose 8% to $1.17 billion on an 8% gain in net orders to 2,784. Analysts had expected a 6.3% gain in orders. Revenue advanced 6.5% to $871.6 million, below the Zacks Investment Research consensus for $887 million.Deliveries were flat at 2,223 homes.

The stock hit 31.83 soon after the open, briefly retaking its 50-day moving average for the first time since the end of January.""We anticipate our housing gross profit margin will continue to strengthen throughout the year as we deliver more homes from newer, higher-margin communities,"" Jeffrey Mezger said in the earnings release. He also cited ""good sales momentum.""Demand is high for housing, especially among first-time buyers, a key customer group for the entry-level homes KB Home specializes in.""The Spring selling season is off to a strong start,"" KB Home said, citing the solid orders figures.That could be welcome news for the likes of LGI Homes (LGIH), PulteGroup (PHM) and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC), which saw their stocks tumble after NVR (NVR) reported weak Q4 earnings in January. The Building-Residential/Commercial group now sits in 142nd place among the 197 industries that IBD tracks, after topping the list in 2017.LGI Homes, an IBD 50 member and one of the other builder stocks to retake its 50-day line before Friday, advanced 0.5%. Pulte Group erased reversed from early gains to sink 1.2%, M.D.C. Holdings lost 1.9%, NVR fell 1% and D.R. Horton (DHI) dipped 0.6%.The triple-leveraged ETF Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Suppliers (NAIL) fell 3.3%, while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) ETF lost 1.7%, adding to Thursday's big losses.Wedbush Securities analyst Jay McCanless says KB Home could fuel a groupwide price surge that would help many move above their 50-day lines, a key technical support, for the first time in months.""Given we haven't seen any company-specific data for a couple of weeks, if we were to see KB beat on both orders and revenues it could be a tailwind for the group,"" McCanless said in an interview. ""We have got a mixed picture on housing from the macro data, so if we get an across-the-board beat from one of the bigger entry-level homebuilders, it could send up stocks in the group as a whole.""Positive comments on pricing trends, such as input costs, would be further catalyst, he added. Another boost for the firm is the fact that housing supply in California has shrunk over the last year, while it also dominates the list of America's least-affordable markets.""KB focuses on California, and a lot of builders are invested in that state. If during the earnings call they have good things to say about California it could also positively impact the group,"" McCanless said.There have already been two positive indications for entry-level demand, he said, namely LGI Homes' strong comparable closing sales in January and February and William Lyon Homes' (WLH) purchase of privately held RSI Communities, which focuses on entry-level buyers.But recent housing data have been mixed. New-home sales retreated significantly in December and January on a seasonally adjusted basis. New-home sales unexpectedly dipped in February, the Commerce Department said Friday.But existing-home sales rose in February, the National Association of Realtors said earlier in the week.The number of first-time buyers tumbled by 31% year-over-year, accounting for 29% of transactions in February. According to realtors and economists, this number should be at 40% for a robust housing market.To make matters worse for buyers, pricing gains are outpacing wage growth, even though the unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1%. A strong labor market increases demand for housing, making the shortage issue even more problematic.Expectations of improved wage gains and continued solid hiring — along with millennials getting married, having kids and moving to the suburbs — should keep demand strong, however, despite the rate of a 30-year fixed mortgage last week nearing a four-year high of 4.46%.Homebuilders are working to ease the supply squeeze, and the government reported last Friday that in February the number of single-family housing units under construction was at its highest level since June 2008.

41,DHI,"A recent tumble in homebuilder stocks is a natural correction that will give way to continued gains despite some mixed quarterly earnings reports, analysts say.X IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group had been a mainstay in the top 10 of the 197 industries that IBD tracks, and had a solid start to 2018 after doubling in 2017. But today, it carries a middling rank of 94 and has fallen 13% from a Jan. 19 high.However, Wedbush Securities analyst Jay McCanless thinks the decline is a natural correction, given the group's stellar performance last year.""The group had a very solid price-appreciation run from September 2017 all the way to year-end so it doesn't surprise me we've seen a bit of a pullback in the group,"" he said. ""Overall outlook is good for 2018. Factors on the ground that drove demand higher in 2017 are still there in 2018.""Demand should continue to be strong, especially in single-family homes, McCanless said. In particular, first-time buyers and empty-nesters looking to move into smaller homes are expected to continue to drive growth, which has already exceeded expectations.""At first in 2017 I don't think people realized how strong demand was from that buyer cohort, and that if anything strengthened during the fourth calendar quarter of 2017, and is giving builders a pretty good tailwind going into 2018,"" he added.Another factor driving growth is competition among mortgage lenders, which include banks and new nonbanking lenders that have entered the market, McCanless said. That has expanded the availability of mortgage credit over the last 18 months and will help feed volume as well as normal demand coming from millennials.Among firms reporting this week, McCanless said D.R. Horton (DHI), PulteGroup (PHM) and M/I Homes (MHO) had exceeded his expectations in terms of order growth and pricing growth. He currently holds a neutral rating on D.R. Horton and PulteGroup and rates M/I Homes as outperform.CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon has been impressed with the discipline shown by builders.""I think homebuilders have done a very good job in terms of expense control, and we are expecting gross margins to improve in 2018"" Leon said. ""Overall the homebuilders, perhaps from lessons learned from the financial crisis, are more conservative in their brand development and are executing better on their existing communities.""Leon rates D.R. Horton as a strong buy and PulteGroup as a buy. He upgraded Meritage Homes (MTH) to a buy from hold following its earnings report Thursday.According to Leon, the Sun Belt has been the biggest area of growth, especially the Southeast, Southwest and California. He marked the Midwest and Northeast as slower markets.Tax reforms also provide a double benefit to homebuilders: They help fuel demand from buyers by putting more money in their pockets, and they free up more capital for homebuilders, who can use the money to expand.""Historically, wage growth is the best leading indicator for housing demand,""  McCanless said. ""As long as jobs numbers continue to do well, that's the most important indicator.""Meanwhile, homebuilders are seeing their tax rate coming down from an average of 38% to around 25%.And McCanless believes firms will be looking to use their boosted coffers to invest and grow.""At this point builders are looking for more land opportunities. I expect that will be the first place they allocate that capital. Investing in the business and growing the business will be the first place they spend the money.Shareholders stand to benefit too, as other excess cash could be returned through dividend increases and share buybacks.Higher labor costs have been a consistent threat, and McCanless does not see this improving anytime soon. ""We just do not have enough workers to meet the demand that's out there.""Material costs have also risen, with lumber and concrete cited as problem commodities, though some firms have been able to absorb the costs due to an increase in the selling price of finished homes.But the biggest threat to homebuilders will be rising mortgage rates, especially if they saw a significant gain in a relatively short span of four to six weeks. Slow and gradual increases will not negatively impact demand, however.The picture was mixed on firms reporting earnings Thursday, with two of the three failing to hit EPS estimates, though all exceeded expectations on revenue.Meritage Homes was the best performer, with its 9.8% EPS rise to $1.34 beating analyst estimates by 9 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue grew 1.3% to $946 million and topped estimates of $934 million.

42,DHI,"America's largest home construction company D.R. Horton (DHI) reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings Wednesday amid growing concerns about homebuilding stocks. D.R. Horton jumped at the open, but the stock and those of other homebuilder stocks met resistance at a key level.XD.R. Horton earned 77 cents a share, up 40% vs. a year earlier. That excluded a $115 million charge related to the Trump tax cuts,Revenue climbed nearly 15% to $3.332 billion. Those beat views for EPS of 64 cents and revenue of $3.273 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Net sales orders increased 17% in value to $3.2 billion and 16% in homes to 10,753.D.R. Horton reaffirmed its fiscal 2018 revenue forecast of $15.5 billion to $16.3 billion. Analysts see $16.131 billion. The builder slightly raised its pretax operating margin forecast.Shares jumped more than 5% to 51.24 shortly after the open on the stock market today, just retaking the 50-day moving average, but soon pared gains, closing up just 1.1% at 49.05.The Building-Residential/Commercial group was the top-performing industry in 2017, nearly doubling in value. But D.R. Horton and other home builders tumbled last Thursday, when the sector came under pressure following a disappointing earnings report from industry giant NVR (NVR). NVR shares crashed through its 50-day moving average in massive volume, triggering a clear sell signal. That same day, the Commerce Department said December new-home sales sank more than expected, though they were still up 14% on the previous year.Homebuilding stocks have continued to struggle. PulteGroup (PHM) beat Wall Street earnings estimates Tuesday, albeit narrowly. But shares fell as gross margins fell in the latest quarter, while Pulte suggested they would continue to be squeezed amid concerns over rising labor costs and commodity prices.PulteGroup, like D.R. Horton, rallied back to its 50-day line Wednesday morning, but then reversed. Pulte closed down 2.8%. Direxion Daily Homebuilders & Suppliers (NAIL), a triple-leveraged ETF, also reversed from an early move to its 50-day to fall 3.2%.Eagle Materials (EXP), a building materials firm, tumbled 4.75% Wednesday, crashing through its 50-day line as revenue came in slightly below views.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The Trump tax reform changed the home mortgage interest deduction so it only applies to the first $750,000 of debt, down from $1 million previously. This could potentially hit the high end of the market.But even with the one-time charge and the mortgage deduction capped, CEO David Auld said the tax reforms will have a positive impact, and that he expects it will lead to more demand at the affordable end, which was described as the most underserved segment of the market.""The alternative is rents and if you want to lock in your housing costs, you pretty much got (to buy a) home and build equity,"" Auld said. ""So it's a strong economy, more money in their pockets those are both ramps for D.R. Horton.""Meanwhile, millions of millennials are looking to move to suburban areas after starting families, also fueling demand.And while mortgage rates are rising, with the 10-year Treasury topping 2.7% this week for the first time in nearly three years Monday, they are still at relatively low levels historically. At least for now, rising rates are fueling a rush to buy, according to Auld.CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon maintained a strong buy on D.R. Horton, with a 12-month target of 59.""As a leader in starter and first move-up homes, we see DHI favorably impacted by tax reform due to its Sun Belt geography not in high tax states and affordable product to more households,"" Leon said in a research note. ""In FY 18, we see DHI realizing strong orders to support mid-teen revenue, 21% gross margins and expense control.""CFRA also raised its EPS estimate for fiscal 2018 by 35 cents to $3.60, and started its 2019 target at $4.15.Thursday is a buy day for homebuilder earnings, with MDC Holdings (MDC), Meritage Homes (MTH) and M.I. Homes (MHO) all issuing results. But they are much smaller builders than NVR, Pulte and especially D.R. Horton.NVR erased gains to retreat 0.85%. MDC was up 1.1%. M.I. Homes fell 0.1% while Meritage slid 1.6%.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED INHomebuilder Stocks Continue To Slide On NVR Miss Ahead Of Key Earnings Reports Earnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

44,DHI,"Stocks were higher at midday Wednesday but gave back some gains, as the market tried to find its footing following Tuesday's broad slide.X The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.4% increase, a leap that came largely thanks to Boeing's (BA) 5% rally to an all-time high. Boeing today beat earnings expectations and gave an upbeat forecast on profit and revenue for the coming year.The S&P 500 was up 0.1% after being up as much as 0.6% in today's market. The Nasdaq also climbed around 0.1% as it also faded from early gains. The main indexes recovered only a fraction of Tuesday's sharp losses and were near session lows. As IBD's signature market analysis column, The Big Picture, has noted, the market has seemed frothy and a larger pullback would not be surprising.Volume was lower compared with the same time Tuesday. Breadth was mixed, with advancers over decliners by 6-to-5 on the NYSE but losers ahead on the Nasdaq by the same ratio.The small-cap Russell 2000 reversed lower and was down a fraction. The Dow transports, however, rose 0.6% as airline and trucking stocks were among the morning's top performers.Brazil-based airline Azul (AZUL) broke out of a cup-without-handle base, gapping past a 29.53 buy point. But volume was unimpressive.A few other breakouts also were fading, including insurer Chubb (CB) (which tried to top a 156.10 buy point) and chip company Aquantia (AQ) (13.90 entry). Chubb missed earnings estimates late Tuesday. Aquantia went public on Nov. 3 and is thinly traded with an average daily turnover of 224,000 shares.Internet retail also was one of the day's winners, as Amazon.com (AMZN) rose to a new high and extended a scorching advance.The stock has risen more than 20% from its 1,213.51 buy point, an increase that justifies taking profits. Amazon.com reports earnings Thursday after the close, and shareholders have the opportunity to lock in gains and sit out the earnings announcement, and thus the risk that comes with any quarterly report.Amazon has been a member of IBD Leaderboard since March 29, 2017.Homebuilders were bouncing back and were one of the 10 best industry groups this morning. D.R. Horton (DHI) beat earnings expectations Wednesday. But the stock met resistance at the 50-day moving average and erased most of its early gains. It was a disappointing move that failed to remove worries about the industry's ability to remain a market leader.Energy, recreational vehicle, steel and some retail industry groups were the weakest. U.S. crude prices fell 0.3% to $64.27 a barrel. Officials reported a surprisingly large build in domestic crude inventories while oil production increased again.The Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY), an ETF that tracks the IBD 50 index, was only slightly higher but still endeavoring to rise from support at the key 50-day moving average.RELATED:Boeing Beats Q4 Earnings Forecast, Gives Strong GuidanceHomebuilder Giant D.R.

45,DHI,"PulteGroup (PHM) narrowly topped fourth-quarter results, kicking off earnings from several homebuilders this week. But shares continued to stumble, as rising labor and materials costs curb profit margins.X Estimates: EPS was expected to rise to 84 cents a share, with revenue climbing to $2.788 billion up 25% vs. a year earlier, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: PulteGroup earned 85 cents a share with revenue rising to $2.794 billion. That beat Zacks estimates slightly, however some other consensus forecasts had Pulte sales at $2.82 billion. In the equivalent quarter of 2016 they beat EPS estimates by 9%. In revenue the company outperformed expectations by just 0.2%, a drop from the 6.9% on the same quarter of 2016. It had missed Wall Street expectations on earnings in each of the previous three quarters. Demand was strong across the US, including Massachusetts, Texas, Nevada, Arizona and California.New orders rose 14% to 4,805 homes and by 22% to $2 billion.However, adjusted gross margin fell to 23.8% vs. 24.9% a year earlier as wages rise and commodity prices climb.PulteGroup also announced a $500 million stock buyback program. It'll be added to its existing plan, which has $94 million remaining.Outlook: Management expects demand in the housing sector to continue to improve with the active adult and entry level markets were cited as growth areas. But Pulte sees margins squeezed further due to increasing labor and material costs, with lumber and concrete highlighted as particular concerns. ""There remain many positive forces pushing the market higher,"" President and CEO Ryan Marshall said during the earnings call. ""Employment trends are favorable and wages are showing signs of growth.""But Pulte sees homebuilding gross margin slipping for a third straight year in 2018, even with home prices continuing to climb.Stock: Shares fell 2.1% to 32.72 in very heavy volume on the stock market today, though off session lows of 31.57.  Pulte tumbled 3.2% on Monday, plunging through its 50-day moving average in above-average trade. The stock has fallen more than 8% since hitting a decade high last week.With a Composite Rating of 90 out of 99, PulteGroup is currently No. 2 in the Building-Residential/Commercial group. The sector had topped all 197 industries that IBD tracks in 2017, and had a solid start to 2018 despite mortgage rates continuing to climb.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.However, weak Q4 results from NVR (NVR) last Thursday raised concerns that the group's long run may be ending.NVR stock crashed through its 50-day moving average and 10-week line in huge volume. Several other builders have also sold off with D.R. Horton (DHI) among those also undercutting their 50-day lines.Across all of its divisions and brands, PulteGroup opened 247 communities in 2017. The business serves all major consumer groups and operates in around 50 major metro markets.In an effort to improve operating and financial performance PulteGroup has been attempting to improve overhead leverage, increase inventory turns and implement new pricing strategies.Demand for housing is strong as millennials start families and look to move to suburban areas. The economy has also been picking up steam. CEO Marshall said it will be another week before the sector enters its spring sales season, when management will be able to get a firmer handle on demand.Headwinds are growing. In addition to rising land and labor costs, the Trump tax reform means that the home mortgage interest deduction only applies to the first $750,000 of debt, down from $1 million previously. That could potentially hit the high end of the market. Mortgage rates are rising with the 10-year Treasury topping 2.7% Monday for the first time in nearly three years, but they are still at relatively low levels historically.CFRA Research analyst Kenneth Leon kept a buy rating and price target of 37 on Pulte following the earnings report.""We raise our 2018 EPS estimate by $0.20 to $3.00 and start 2019 at $3.40,"" Leon said in a research note. ""We estimate 19% revenue growth in 2018 with a $4B backlog value and expected 5% to 7% price increase in ASP for homes delivered. We see the 2018 gross margin improving by 100 bp to 24% in 2018 with expense control.""However he added that a risk to sales growth is whether Pulte can add to its 790 home communities.PulteGroup's results lead off a busy week for the sector. D.R. Horton reports Wednesday, followed by MDC Holdings (MDC), Meritage Homes (MTH) and M.I. Homes (MHO). D.R. Horton rallied to close up 0.4%. MDC shed 0.8%, M.I.

57,DHI,"Homebuilder stocks continued to come under pressure Monday ahead of several key earnings reports in the wake of missing fourth-quarter estimates last week.X In 2017, the Building-Residential/Commercial group topped all 197 industries that IBD tracks, nearly doubling in value.  But weak Q4 results from NVR (NVR) last Thursday raised concerns that the group's long run may be ending. Its shares skidded 5.85% to 3,377.35 that day, plunging through its 50-day moving average and 10-week line for the first time in over a year in massive volume, a clear sell signal. NVR shares lost another 3.3% Monday.Several other homebuilder stocks are testing or undercutting key support as well. Five earnings reports this week may tell investors if NVR is an outlier or not.PulteGroup (PHM) fell 3.2% to close at 33.43 on the stock market today, dipping below its 50-day moving average. Analysts expect PulteGroup early Tuesday to report earnings of 84 cents a share, up 25% vs. a year earlier, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue should climb 12% to $2.788 billion.D.R. Horton (DHI), which reports Wednesday, sank 4% to 48.32, losing sight of its 50-day moving average after closing below that level last week. The company sees EPS climbing 15% to 63 cents, with revenue rising 13% to $3.273 billion.Reporting early Thursday is M.D.C. Holdings (MDC), which held up against its 50-day moving average line despite Monday's 1.6% drop. The consensus earnings per share among analysts was $0.66, which would be a drop of 8% on the equivalent quarter of 2016. The estimated sales of $719 million would be a drop of 2% on the previous year.Meritage Homes (MTH), which also reports early Thursday, fell 3% after undercutting its 50-day moving average last week. Its consensus earnings per share among analysts is $1.25, which would be up 2% on the equivalent quarter in 2016. The estimated sales of $931 million would be a year-on-year increase of 6%.M.I. Homes (MHO) fell 2.9%, marking its seventh straight loss and falling further below its 50-day line. When M.I. Homes reports late Thursday analysts expect earnings of $1.04 per share, which would be a 55% jump. Sales are estimated to climb 13% to $592 million.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.In addition to Pulte, D.R. Horton and other builders reporting earnings, luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) fell below its 50-day line intraday Monday, down 3.7% for its fifth straight loss.  KB Home (KBH) and Lennar (LEN) are approaching their 50-day lines.However in a research note JPMorgan analysts were confident NVR's performance would not be mirrored by other companies in the group.""We do not view these results as a read-through for the other builders and remain comfortable with our outlook for upside to orders and gross margins for the rest of the group this earnings season,"" the research note said.December new-home sales, released Thursday by the Commerce Department shortly after NVR's results, tumbled 9.3% in December to an annual rate of 625,000, far below views for 675,000. But sales were still 14% above a year earlier.Demand is strong as millennials start families and look to move to suburban areas. The economy has also been picking up steam, with job and wage growth solid. Mortgage rates are rising with the 10-year Treasury topping 2.7% Monday for the first time in nearly three years. But they are still at relatively low levels historically. The financial benefit of owning rather than renting is also a boon for demand.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED INEarnings Calendar, Analyst Estimates And Stocks To WatchNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

65,DHI,"Existing-home sales fell 3.2% to an annual rate of 5.38 million last month, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Economists had expected home resales at an annualized pace of 5.65 million. January's numbers represent the slowest sales pace since September, while the 4.8% year-over-year decline was the worst since August 2014.X Existing homes for sale rose 4.1% to 1.52 million, but were still down 9.5% vs. a year earlier. Tight supplies are limiting sales, NAR said. Home prices were up 5.8% vs. a year earlier.The report gauges actual home sale closings, not contract signings. So the data likely don't reflect the sharp rise in mortgage rates in 2018.However, demand for loans to buy homes fell 6% in the week ended Feb. 16, following a 6% drop in the prior week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. Overall mortgage applications slid 6.6%. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose 7 basis points to 4.64%, the highest since January 2014.  Year-over-year, purchase loan applications rose 3%, down a percentage point.Treasury yields have been rising amid strong global economic growth and a double dose of fiscal stimulus via Trump tax cuts and a sharp rise in federal government spending. Solid hiring and improving wage growth, along with a wave of millennials having families, support housing demand despite the rise in still-low mortgage rates.Last week, the Commerce Department reported stronger-than-expected housing starts for January.The IBD-Building-Residential/Commercial group was 2017's top performer out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. A surprise profit miss by NVR Inc.

66,DHI,"Just about everything (other than inflation) is lining up against investors in long-term Treasuries: stronger tax-cut-fueled growth; a Congress that is arguing over how much to hike spending; an unwinding of global central bank bond buying; and talks between North Korea and South Korea on easing military tensions. Add to that Wednesday's report that China is souring on purchases of U.S. government bonds.X All of these factors helped push the 10-year Treasury yield up as high as 2.59% on Wednesday, before easing to 2.55% amid speculation that the U.S. will pull out of Nafta. That's still not far below the four-year-high 2.63% touched in March.Yet, in one respect, markets may be underestimating upward pressure on long-term Treasury yields. While a number of Wall Street firms have said that a trillion-dollar deficit could return in fiscal 2019, the realization hasn't hit that annual deficits could approach $2 trillion, about 7% of GDP, by 2027.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rallied modestly early Thursday after retreating Wednesday but well off intraday lows. Bank stocks pushed higher in Wednesday's stock market trading, helped by prospects for wider net interest margins that would come from rising long-term rates without an equivalent rise in short-term Treasuries. Bank stocks edged higher early Thursday.Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC) rose 1.4%, Bank of America (BAC) 0.9% and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) 1.1%.Meanwhile, homebuilder stocks sought to rebound after tumbling on the prospects for higher mortgage rates. Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers (TOL) rose 1% after sinking 2.9% on Wednesday. D.R. Horton (DHI) gained 1.5% after Wednesday's 3.5% retreated. Lennar (LEN), which sailed past fourth-quarter revenue estimates Wednesday but missed earnings due to a tax-related shift, was an exception, climbing 2.4% Wednesday. Lennar rose 1.4% Thursday morning.Some analysts noted that Beijing's reported warning, which may be an effort to gain leverage in trade disputes with the U.S., may not be such a big deal because ""China has not been a big buyer of Treasuries for several years now,"" as Jefferies economists Thomas Simons and Ward McCarthy wrote.Even before the Trump tax cuts passed, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting a $1.5 trillion deficit in 2027 as entitlement spending swells. How could that get as high as $2 trillion? The first step would be to extend individual tax cuts that are set to sunset after 2025, as the GOP vows to do. That could add about $150 billion to the 2027 deficit.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Next, factor in behavioral changes that government scorekeepers didn't expect. Already California, New York and other blue states, whose upper-middle-class taxpayers could be hit by new limits on the deduction of state and local taxes, are trying to nail down ways to protect their residents from paying higher federal taxes. One idea is to allow individuals to make voluntary tax-protected contributions to state government, in lieu of tax payments. Limiting deductions was supposed to save $100 billion a year by 2025.Further, some analysts believe that the official score of the legislation underestimates the revenue loss from pass-through businesses, which account for the vast majority of enterprises, opting to incorporate to take advantage of the new 21% corporate tax rate or otherwise reorganize to minimize tax bills.Here's another coming shock: The Trump tax legislation was supposed to cut government health care spending by $53 billion in 2027 by repealing the individual mandate, but ObamaCare may end up costing substantially more — not less — due to Trump's policies. Despite repeal of the individual mandate and a sign-up period for HealthCare.gov that was half as long, the number of people signing up for coverage barely fell from a year ago, and the total could end up being higher once unpaid enrollment is winnowed out, because millions more were eligible for free ObamaCare bronze plans this year.Even still, most of the 4.5 million uninsured Americans who were eligible for free coverage likely didn't sign up because they didn't realize it or missed the sign-up window. The surge in free bronze plans is a result of President Trump's decision to halt payments for cost-sharing subsidies, which the Affordable Care Act promised to insurers to reimburse their expense for dramatically shrinking deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income households who buy silver coverage.Trump, who had the authority to end the payments funded by President Obama without a congressional appropriation, had long threatened the move as an act of sabotage. But most state health insurance officials seized an opening to jury-rig their exchanges in a way that made the government's cost of subsidies soar and turned the attempted sabotage into a life raft.If Democrats reclaim the White House, expect them to seize on the expansion of free health coverage under Trump with more intensive enrollment efforts, or else states could pursue auto-enrollment initiatives to enroll modest-income households in free plans, substantially boosting the federal government's cost.Putting everything together, as deficits widen from tax cuts that don't expire, state and individual behavioral shifts that further reduce tax revenues, and higher-than-expected ObamaCare costs, debt service costs will balloon as well.A  new projection is out from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that the annual federal deficit will hit $2.1 trillion in 2027 on the current trajectory, including a fuller range of tax extensions, disaster relief, a lifting of annual spending limits known as the sequester and all the additional debt service.One near-term development that could stand in the way of deeper sell-off in long-term Treasuries is the prospect for a government shutdown. The likelihood of a shutdown seemed to dim late Tuesday, when a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to renew protections for Dreamers under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. While Trump is expected to challenge the dubious ruling in court, the issue may not be a barrier to keeping the government open for business beyond Jan. 19, when the most recent budget authorization expires. Still, Democratic leaders in Congress are talking about the reprieve as temporary and continue to tie a DACA fix to a longer government funding resolution.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tax-Cut Windfall Mounts: Higher Pay, Lower Utility BillsThese Five Top Stocks Hit Buy Points; Why This One Stands OutHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Snap CEO Evan Spiegel acknowledged complaints that Snapchat is ""hard to use"" and said that the app will be redesigned. Shares crashed 16%, even with Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) buying a 12% stake in the social media firm.RELATED:Snap Slammed On Quarterly Results As Tencent Acquires A StakeThree China internet companies, Sina (SINA), Weibo (WB) and Autohome (ATHM), all reported quarterly results that beat expectations.

Penney (JCP) reported better-than-expected Q3 results after recently slashing full-year guidance.Walt Disney (DIS) disclosed a surprise drop in Q4 profit and revenue amid reports of more upcoming ESPN layoffs, but CEO Bob Iger announced that there would be a brand-new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, gave its ESPN streaming platform a name and launch date, and said its Disney-only over-the-top service would be priced ""substantially below"" Netflix (NFLX), reversing shares higher late Thursday. Meanwhile, reports surfaced that 21st Century Fox (FOXA) had held talks to sell the bulk of itself to Disney. Iger refused to address ""press speculation"" on the call. Disney rose solidly more than 6%. 21st Century Fox, which reported solid results, shot up 15.5%.On Monday, oil prices rose to their highest levels since mid-2015 on political unrest in the Middle East. Crude closed the week with a 2.3% gain to $56.74 a barrel. Saudi Arabia arrested several members of the royal family over the prior week and said that a missile attack from Yemen and supported by Iran could be considered an ""act of war.""

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) on Wednesday topped revenue and earnings views and confirmed guidance for 10% yearly Eylea growth.Priceline Group (PCLN) topped third-quarter estimates but the online travel agency's weak earnings outlook sent shares plunging 13.5% on Tuesday.

79,DHI,"Stocks came off lows in afternoon trading Monday, although some industry groups were under added pressure.X Losses were well-contained, with the main indexes trading inside Friday's price ranges and declines at less than 0.3%.The Nasdaq composite was off 0.1%, the S&P 500 0.2% and Dow Jones industrial average 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which has been lagging the major indexes for about a week, fell 0.2%.Volume was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Friday. Although the key indexes pared losses, breadth was poor. Losers led winners by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq.Energy, chip equipment, homebuilding and solar industry groups were some of the weakest in today's market.Signs of stress are growing in the homebuilding group. LGI Homes (LGIH), William Lyon Homes (WLH), Toll Bros. (TOL) and D.R. Horton (DHI) have moved below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since September, when those stocks were basing. A few other builders had already slid below the 50-day line.Myriad Genetics (MYGN) gapped down in heavy trading after Goldman Sachs initiated the stock with a sell rating today. The genetic testing company erased all gains from a breakout past a 37.40 buy point, which results in a sell signal.But Gilead Sciences (GILD) soared above the 86.37 buy point of a cup without handle. Volume was more than triple its usual pace. But the relative strength line is well short of a new high, which may hamper the stock's move to new highs.The biotech is following up Friday's 5.3% surge, which came after Jefferies upgraded Gilead to buy from hold and raised its price target to 95 from 87.Fibria (FBR) broke out of a cup without handle, clearing the 17.31 buy point in heavy volume. Reports quoted by Reuters say Netherlands-based Paper Excellence is considering acquiring the Brazil-based forestry company. The relative strength line is trending higher but has not made a new high.Universal Display (OLED) fell 6% and continues to struggle below the 50-day moving average. The maker of organic light-emitting diode technology has been weakening on reports of flagging demand for Apple's iPhone X, which uses an OLED display.

80,DHI,"The major indexes cooled off in unison on Monday, taking a well-deserved break after rallying four weeks in a row. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) showed disappointing action with its third significant drop in four sessions — a 2% decline.X The stock, which led the market in 2017 with a stunning turnaround in fundamentals and a 46% advance last year, is now further below its 50-day moving average, which itself is flattening. Failure to rebound quickly back above the medium-term support and resistance line would indicate a serious correction is in store.Meanwhile, some top-notch Chinese ADRs got thrown for a loop. Weibo (WB) sank nearly 3% in heavy turnover after getting penalized by the Chinese government for allowing some of its social media networks to showcase obscene content.China Lodging (HTHT), a longtime member of the IBD 50, fell as much as 17% in the opening minutes of trade in mini-flash-crash fashion before shaving the decline to 4% at 150.41. The hotel chain sharply undercut a 142.90 buy point in a cup without handle but also got buying support near its rising 50-day moving average.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5% while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 0.7%. Volume was higher on the NYSE vs. Friday, according to early data, and that likely points to a new distribution day for the 500. Nasdaq turnover came in close to Friday's level.Distribution points to unusually heavy institutional selling in the market. A spate of such distributions can end a bull market. However, as noted in IBD's Big Picture column, the distribution day count on both the 500 and the Nasdaq remains low.The S&P SmallCap 600 dropped 0.5%. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, homebuilders, computer hardware and peripherals, specialty enterprise software, gold mining, oil and gas machinery, coal and construction gear firms fell the most, each losing 2% or more.Following another sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, homebuilders showed signs of heavy profit-taking by institutional players as no fewer than half a dozen names sliced through their 50-day moving averages in recent days. A failure to rebound quickly would mean it's time for individual investors to play smart defense and lock in at least partial profits.Top-rated homebuilders that slid hard below the 50-day line include NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH), William Lyon Homes (WLH), D.R. Horton (DHI), Pulte Group (PHG) and Toll Bros. (TOL).NVR initiated its strong price run with a big breakout past 1,845.47 on Jan. 25, 2017. Shares went on to double before the recent slide.Going back to Apple, those who bought at the Oct. 27 breakout from a second-stage cup with handle at 160.97 need to be ready to exit that position to avoid taking a loss or surrendering all of the recent gains. At one point, the iPhone giant rallied 11.9% past that proper entry point. Through Monday's close, that post-breakout gain has been whittled down to 4%.In IBD Stock Checkup, Apple's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has fallen fast and is now at a D+, indicating net selling by institutions over the past 13 weeks. A rating of C+ or higher on a scale of A to E is ideal, for it implies that overall demand for shares by mutual funds, pension funds, banks, insurers and the like is still positive.Long-term holders, however, can continue to keep watching, even though results from Apple are due Thursday after the close. One reason is that the stock maintains a generous air cushion above its rising long-term 200-day moving average.Two, amid all the headlines centered on iPhone X sales, the reality is that Apple has built an ecosystem that has enabled it to generate strong revenue growth in digital services. According to past IBD reports and statements by CEO Tim Cook, the company looks poised to achieve its goal of doubling its revenue in services by 2020.Three, there is a good chance that the company can maintain its streak of low double-digit revenue growth. The Street sees revenue in the December-ended fiscal first quarter rising 11% to $86.75 billion, then increasing an additional 28%, 24% and 16% in the next three quarters. That's a significant improvement from gains of 3%, 5%, 7% and 12% in the prior four quarters.Earnings are seen jumping 13% in Q1 to $3.81 a share, then climbing 37%, 32% and 21% vs. year-ago levels in the next three quarters through September 2018.RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: Why It's Still Too Early To Buy Back Bitcoin Investment TrustStocks Near A Buy ZoneDo You Know How To Spot Major Stock Market Peaks?

Meanwhile, apparel and shoe retailers, coal producers and oil-and-gas drillers enjoyed a year-end burst of performance. Momentum in those groups is worth watching into 2018.LGI Homes and NVR have surged 161% and 102% this year, while homebuilding peers KB Home (KBH), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) have fared almost as well, with gains ranging from 81% to 102%. They are benefiting from pent-up millennial demand as well as broad strength in the economy.The residential/commercial-building industry group, as a whole, soared 99.4% for the year and 23.1% in the final quarter of 2017. But headwinds loom.The housing sector tumbled in early November after the GOP tax reform plan set a cap on deductions for mortgages and property taxes.

101,DHI,"It's been a fantastic year for homebuilders, ranked among the top industries since May. That's made winners of a couple of ETFs, although one is well ahead of the other.X SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) are both in IBD's ETF Leaders screen. Yet, neither is a pure-play homebuilding ETF, and the two funds are structured quite differently.That helps explain why iShares U.S. Home Construction has sharply outperformed, up about 57% this year compared with about 31% for SPDR S&P Homebuilders.SPDR Homebuilders (which holds 35 stocks) is only 33% invested in builders, while iShares Home Construction (with nearly 50 holdings) is more builder-heavy, with nearly two-thirds of the portfolio in those companies.Both also have a good share of building products companies: 33% for SPDR Homebuilders and 15% for iShares Home Construction. The rest of the portfolios consist of home furnishing, home improvement (Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW)), appliance and other companies related to the housing industry.The heavier reliance on homebuilders has indeed helped iShares U.S. Home Construction put up better returns in 2017.For example, D.R. Horton (DHI), which makes single-family homes in 26 states, has surged more than 35% from a breakout to new highs on Sept. 12. D.R. Horton is the largest holding in the iShares fund, with a 13.2% weighting. By comparison, the same stock occupies 4.4% in SPDR Homebuilders, which equal-weights its holdings.Because of that structure, winning homebuilding stocks have about the same weighting as fund laggards such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Johnson Controls (JCI).Both funds own the other major homebuilders that have rallied this year, such as Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Bros. (TOL) and CalAtlantic (CAA).Chartwise, both ETFs formed three-weeks-tight patterns in the first half of December and are trading close to possible buy points. For iShares Home Construction, the entry is at 44.09 and for SPDR Homebuilders 44.59. The primary risk is in the lengthy advance both ETFs have enjoyed this year.The new tax bill cuts the amount of mortgage interest homeowners can deduct on their taxes, a measure that particularly hit luxury-home builder Toll Bros. But with the U.S. economy trending higher, many analysts maintain a positive outlook.""The National Association of Home Builders' index was released and it indicated that developers are near giddy,"" economist Joel L. Naroff wrote in a note Tuesday. ""The index is now above every reading we saw during the housing bubble.""The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

Horton No. 1 in the group, based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance. D.R. Horton cleared a buy point, the point at which investors have the best chance for near-term gains, in late September and has since charged ahead 20%. Here's a place to look for other stocks that may be poised for gains.Highflying homebuilder stocks hit some turbulence last week amid news that the House Republican Tax Cut and Jobs Act would limit the mortgage interest deduction to new mortgages up to $500,000. Toll Brothers (TOL), which sells more luxury homes, suffered more than most, but even it has largely recovered thanks to strong housing market fundamentals. While D.R. Horton sells homes for up to $1 million, its average selling price is about $300,00.The Senate is reportedly leaning toward scrapping the House's lower cap on mortgages eligible for the interest deduction, but it might not preserve the House provision allowing itemizers to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes. Realtors and homebuilders have lined up against the House plan out of concern what it could mean for home prices.Still, homebuilders have surged 104% since Donald Trump's election on Nov. 8, 2016, best out of IBD's 197 industry groups.Shares of mortgage insurance provider Essent Group (ESNT) have come under pressure recently, falling back toward its 50-day moving average.

Apple shares are extended from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point.Energy, telecom and technology led the upside among sector plays in the stock market today, while homebuilders, banks and retail lagged.Bitcoin futures, which began trading on the CBOE (CBOE) Sunday under ticker symbol XBT, triggered at least two trading halts. The futures contract, which expires in January, soared 20% to $18,550 in late-afternoon trade. The cryptocurrency's price was recently near $17,200, according to CoinDesk. While the futures launch was seen as a move toward Bitcoin's legitimacy, it could have a ""material negative impact"" on the digital currency's price as investors potentially move to futures and out of Bitcoin, Munster said in a research note.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) surged more than 12%.Sector rotation is underway as stock market leadership has shifted from high tech to builders and financials over the past few months.The top sector fund, iShares US Home Construction (ITB), gained 25.5% during the three months through Dec. 5.

Econoday's consensus number had shown…
"
107,DHI,"The Federal Reserve took a small step to begin unwinding its crisis-driven asset purchases on Wednesday, but since the move was widely expected, the meeting's real drama hinged on the outlook for future rate hikes.Despite a string of benign inflation readings, Fed policymakers stuck to their guns, indicating a likelihood of four more rate hikes through the end of 2018.The updated outlook reflects a stark contrast with financial-market pricing, which sees just one rate hike (in December) likely through August 2018, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. The odds of a rate hike by December rose to about 67% from 58% a day ago and just below 50-50 a week earlier.Starting in October, the Fed said it will gradually begin scaling back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet by letting $10 billion in principal run off per month, rather than continuing to reinvest all proceeds of maturing Treasury and mortgage bonds.In a post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that the Fed's projections reflect a consensus that surprisingly tepid inflation this year is ""due to transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the coming year.""Yellen said members would alter their outlook if incoming inflation data continue to undershoot expectations. Yet she also noted a risk that tight labor markets could push up wage and price inflation to an extent that the Fed has to respond by hiking rates faster than expected, potentially risking a recession.Yellen's term is set to expire in February, and President Trump hasn't said if he will reappoint her. Trump has several other Fed vacancies to fill.After the Fed announcement, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially after trading mixed on the stock market today. But following Yellen's comments, the Dow closed up 0.2% and S&P 500 0.1%, while the Nasdaq pared its loss to 0.1%.Treasury yields rose on the Fed announcement.Bank stocks, which have snapped out their funk lately and can get a margin boost from higher rates, were bid higher on the news. On Monday, shares of Citigroup (C) broke above a 69.96 flat-base buy point, often a precursor of further near-term gains, to hit its highest level since January 2009. Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) both have been making a run at buy points. BofA and JPMorgan rose nearly 1% after the Fed news, moving to just below buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Don't look to the Fed for a green light to buy stocks or a red light to sell them. IBD readers were ready for the stock market's push to record heights this month because on Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The rate outlook also looms large for homebuilders, among the best performing industry group this year as interest rates have undershot expectations. NVR (NVR) and D.R. Horton (DHI) are ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group by IBD Stock Checkup, based on earnings, sales and margin trends, as well as relative stock performance.Shares of NVR and D.R. Horton lost more than 1% after the Fed announcement.While there was some evidence of incremental dovishness at the Fed, it wasn't enough to make a difference. In June, 12 of 16 members expected 4 more rate hikes through 2018. Now, it's 11 of 16, meaning there was one new dove. Also, the group of policymakers expects two further rate hikes in 2019, down from three in June. Prices for core personal consumption expenditures are expected to rise 1.9% in 2018 vs. a 2.0% projection in June.But markets focused more on the intermediate term than the long term.""In addition to the macro tailwind of higher rates, banks should benefit from regulatory changes that are currently not reflected in share prices,"" David Kostin, Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients this week.Kostin said he doesn't expect the gradual reversal of the Fed's asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, to result in another ""taper tantrum,"" the name for the sell-off sparked by then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke's signal in 2013 that the central bank would begin slowing its QE asset purchases.Still, a ""reinvestment reflux"" isn't out of the question. Ahead of the Fed announcement, IBD explained how a number of factors could lead Treasury yields to continue their resurgence over the next few months. Those include a flood of new Treasury issuance stemming from the recent deal to lift the debt ceiling, growing prospects of a deficit-increasing tax cut and a move by the European Central Bank to begin curbing its bond buys.RELATED:5 Reasons The Bond Market May Throw Another Fed TantrumCitigroup Breaks Out; These 4 Other Banking Giants Are Near BuysKB Home, Builders In Focus But Ugly Feud Surfaces: Investing Action PlanStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

108,DHI,"Top homebuilder stock KB Home (KBH) is forming a base showing a 24.47 entry with its next quarterly report set for Sep. 18. The chart pattern is a second-stage flat base.X Understand that jumping into a stock right as it gets ready to report means you likely won't have enough time to build a profit cushion before the release. That leaves you exposed to a sudden and perhaps sharp drop if the company misses analyst estimates or provides weak guidance.You can reduce your exposure by waiting to see the actual numbers and the market's reaction. Using an options strategy during earnings season is another way to put yourself in a position to profit, while minimizing the potential downside.Earnings grew 94% last quarter, up from 7% in the prior report. Revenue also increased, from 21% to 24%.Analysts are looking for earnings growth of 11% for the quarter, and 53% growth for the full year. Estimates for the full year were recently revised upward.KB Home has a 92 Composite Rating and holds the No. 7 rank among its peers in the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group.

111,DHI,"In the stock market, focusing on high-quality names going up in price is generally better strategy than targeting the weak price performers, which in many cases are being sold because of deteriorating fundamentals.So what's the best way to identify the market's strongest price performers?IBD's Relative Price Strength Rating (RS Rating) is your ticket. It ranks stocks on a scale of 1 to 99, with 99 being the best. A stock with an RS Rating of 99 means it has outperformed 99% of the stocks in IBD's database based on 12-month price performance.The general rule of thumb is to target stocks with RS Ratings of 80 or higher. It's not a steadfast rule, but it's generally a good pond to fish in when looking for strong-performing growth stocks.Stock screens like the IBD 50, Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight and IPO Leaders are loaded with strong price performers with several other compelling traits as well.When it comes to slower-moving, large-cap stocks, it's OK to be a little more lenient with the RS Rating. Dow component Intel (INTC), for example, has been moving sideways since late January, hurting its recent RS Rating of 66. But big buyers have been in the stock lately, though, as the chip giant is in the early stages of breaking out of a flat base with a 38.55 entry.Homebuilders have been showing high relative strength for some time now. Just recently, the group was up about 63% year-to-date, compared to a 13% gain for the S&P 500. No surprise, then, to see multiple names in the group with high RS Ratings. Leaders in the group like D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) recently boasted RS Ratings of 88 and 86, respectively.Meanwhile, airline stocks have been lagging the market. Year-to-date, the group is down 12% year-to-date. Bright spots in the group include Brazil-based Gol Intelligent (GOL) and SkyWest (SKYW). Both have high RS Ratings but are extended past proper buy points. More widely known names in the group, such as Alaska Air (ALK) and JetBlue (JBLU), have been showing middling price performance at best, with recent RS Ratings of 20 and 19, respectively.Barracuda Networks (CUDA)  offers another example of how sideways and lagging price action can hurt the RS Rating, which is now at 57. Barracuda has doesn't much since hitting a high of 26.69 about a year ago. Shares were recently trading around 24.39.But using the RS Rating isn't as easy as buying all the 99-rated stocks, thinking they're slam dunks for outperformance in coming months. Sometimes, that is the case, especially when a high RS stock is building a base and poised for a breakout.But stocks with high RS Ratings can also be well extended past proper buy points and too late to buy. In the accompanying table, YY Inc. (YY) continues to show outstanding price strength, but it's extended from an 83.10 buy point. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) also owns an outstanding RS Rating. The carmaker is trading tightly near highs after a breakout over an 11.75 buy point. Tight weekly closes after a breakout often yield additional entry points.Buying an extended stock is an easy way to lose money quickly in the stock market. The trick is to find stocks with high RS Ratings that haven taking a breather and moving sideways after a nice run. Those that correct the least tend to hang on to strong RS Ratings.RELATED:Best Stocks To Buy And WatchFree Access To IBD Premium ContentWhen To Sell Stocks: Is Your Stock ""Living"" Under The 10-Week Moving Average?When To Sell Stocks II: Big Breach Of The 50-Day Moving Average Is A Key Sell Signal

117,DHI,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose slightly Tuesday morning vs. fair value ahead of notable economic data and comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen.XThe Nasdaq composite led Monday's selling, testing its 50-day moving average as Facebook (FB) plunged through that key support, Tesla (TSLA) triggered multiple sell signals and Apple (AAPL) kept falling.Meanwhile, a large number of mostly tech breakouts joined Apple and Tesla underwater, including Alibaba (BABA), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA). The Nasdaq composite slid 0.9%, while the big-cap Nasdaq skidded 1.1%, below its 50-day.

But there are several sectors and specific industry groups that are faring well, with Dow components Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) in or near buy zones.IBD'S TAKE: Don't rely on market pundits telling you where they think the market is heading next year. Listen to what the market is saying right by following the major market averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (open access through Oct. 8) for timely analysis.Facebook had been trading tightly in a flat base just below a buy point. But shares fell 4.5% to 162.87 on Monday in heavy volume, tumbling below their 50-day moving average and undercutting the low of their current consolidation. Tesla extended its post-breakout reversal to more than 7% below its 370.10 entry — and through its 50-day to boot — making that buy point invalid. Nvidia round-tripped a 9.5% gain from a buy point, sinking 4.5% to 171, below the 174.66 entry. Apple fell 0.9% to 150.55, following a 5% sell-off last week.Facebook, Tesla and Apple shares did rise a fraction in premarket trading Tuesday. Nvidia climbed nearly 3% after announcing late Monday that it will supply AI-focused chips to several Chinese cloud-computing and server firms.Oil and gas groups and stocks continue to rack up big and steady gains, as crude oil prices have rebounded to their best levels since April.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Valero (VLO) have cleared buy points, while BP (BP) and the Dow's Chevron are close.The key question for these stocks and the broader sector is whether oil and other energy prices keep rising — and when and how quickly shale operators ramp up their production.U.S. crude futures dipped 0.4% in premarket trading to $52 a barrel.Despite Tesla's recent reversal, the broad transportation sector is healthy, from shipping giants FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) to General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to trucking firms J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) to auto- and truck-parts firms such as Dana (DCN) and Lear (LEA) to RV makers Winnebago (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO).Focusing on single-industry success stories, IBD's Aerospace/Defense group is faring well. Boeing and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are among those in buy zones. General Dynamics (GD) is close.Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Marriott International (MAR), and Hyatt Hotels (H) are among several hotel operators that have broken out. But they've generally broken out on light-to-lackluster volume. Casino stocks have been doing well, though Melco Resorts (MLCO) fell below a buy point and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) nearly did so.D.R. Horton (DHI), Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) are all near buy points.On a related note, Home Depot crept out to a buy point on Monday, but in below-average volume.RELATED:The Big Picture: Tech Stocks Crushed As Nasdaq Reaches A Key TestWhy Tesla May Not Be Leading This Part Of The Self-Driving Race75 Recent Breakouts, And This Stock Is The Biggest Winner So Far?New High Analysis: Nasdaq Sell-Off Spares These 7 StocksFacebook Down As Zuckerberg Scraps Stock Plan, Will Sell Shares

119,DHI,"Toll Bros. (TOL), a builder of luxury homes, easily topped fiscal Q3 profit estimates but revenue performance was mixed and full-year guidance was light, sending shares down sharply.Estimates: EPS to increase 9.7% to 68 cents, with revenue rising 16.5% to $1.48 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting EPS of 69 cents on revenue of $1.51 billion.Results: EPS of 87 cents on revenue of $1.5 billion. Net orders rose 24% to 2,163 units. Average price edged up 0.8% to $837,300. Backlog climbed 21% to 6,282 units. Adjust gross margin narrowed to 25% from 25.3%. Homebuilding deliveries jumped 26% to 1,899 units.Outlook: Q4 deliveries of 2,275-2,575 units and full-year deliveries of 7,000-7,300 units, up from a prior guidance of  6,950-7,450 and translating to full-year revenue of $5.6 billion-$6 billion, with the midpoint below the consensus for $5.92 billion.The company is selling through some communities more quickly than anticipated and now expects to end FY 2017 with between 300 and 310 selling communities. About 150 homes that would've been delivered this fiscal year are now anticipated next fiscal year due to a recall from a major lumber manufacturer.""The unemployment rate is at a 15-year low, the economy is growing, the stock market is strong, and home prices continue to rise, putting equity in the pockets of those who may want to sell their existing home and move to a new one,"" said CEO Douglas Yearley in a statement.

Horton provided IBD's SwingTrader with a nice gift after it was added on July 7. It was part of a bullish move among homebuilders while the market was trying to find its footing after the Nasdaq composite breached its 50-day moving average for just the second time this year.Single-family home starts have fallen in four of the last five months, according to Commerce Department data, as the industry faces labor and lot shortages. But homebuilders are still bullish on a strong job market as still-low interest rates boost sales.Last month, D.R. Horton (DHI), Tri Pointe Group (TPH) and M/I Homes (MHO) reported better-than-expected earnings, following mixed results from rival Pulte Group (PHM).RELATED:Homebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market NewsIBD Rating Upgrades: TRI Pointe Flashes Improved Price StrengthHomebuilder Stock Retests Buy Zone, Gets IBD Rating Upgrade

121,DHI,"As the stock market started showing signs of improvement the last couple weeks, more swing trading setups presented themselves. That's in sharp contrast to the low activity of August.While fewer trades can seem boring, the strategy is sound if it's being used to protect capital. Rather than a sign of laziness, low activity can be a sign of prudence.The action in August was especially a sharp contrast to a decent July. Of the 20 trading days in July, 14 had at least one active trade on IBD's SwingTrader at some point in the day. For the 23 trading days in August, only eight had any active trades and usually it was only one stock at time. That was due to a heightened level of caution as a direct result of market weakness.July started and ended the month with no active trades, but had opportunities in the middle. It started with D.R. Horton (DHI) on July 7 as an industry play on a market reversal (1). The market action on SwingTrader shifted from sideways to uptrend the next day.By July 13 (2), a 4% profit was already booked in D.R. Horton and the active trades that day was up to four stocks, three of which were eventually closed for a profit. After 10 days up in a row, the number of active trades started to fall on July 21 (3) with some profit taking, and on July 27 the number came back down to zero as the market dropped (4).August became a month of tries and fails. The next three stocks that were added, one at a time, were all taken off with losses. The adds happened on Aug. 2 (5), Aug. 16 (6) and Aug. 22 (7). The final add happened concurrently with the market action getting switched back to an uptrend. While having three losses in a row isn't desirable, the low activity coupled with an average loss below 3% still allowed for the protection of capital. With some of the stocks it was just a matter of the right stock at the wrong time.Take New Oriental Education (EDU) which was removed for a loss at the end of August. On Sept. 7, the stock vaulted nearly 10%, which would have led to a profitable trade. In retrospect, selling seems like it was a mistake. But holding a stock that's breaking down in an uncertain market is a risk that can have devastating consequences for your portfolio. When New Oriental Education was removed, the market was flattening out and it wasn't until Aug. 30 it started following through on its reversal (8) and stocks started getting added more than one at a time.Though few stocks were added in August, it doesn't mean the search wasn't happening. A few stocks were added as watch list stocks but never became active. Either they never hit their buy zones, or when they did hit their buy zones, volume was lacking. While you could use the excuse that it was due to the summer, you have to question: What will fuel this move if it doesn't start with a strong buying interest? It was just one more factor that led to less action.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Volume Speaks Volumes About Stock TradesThis Adage Rings True For Sideways MarketsSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

123,DHI,"U.S. stock indexes jogged ahead at midday Friday, but volume in the market today was running behind the previous session's pace.XThe Nasdaq advanced 1%, the S&P 500 0.6% and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average 0.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 spurted 0.8%. Volume was lower on both major exchanges.Blue chips were mostly up, with two stocks rising for every one that fell in the Dow Jones industrial average.

124,DHI,"Homebuilders were among the top-performing stocks Friday, fueled by bullish data from LGI Homes (LGIH).LGI Homes late Thursday reported June closings hit a record 623 homes, up 75.5% vs. a year earlier. That signaled accelerating growth: May home closings grew 21.1% Q2 home closings rose 34% and year-to-date closings are up 15.2%.XLGI Homes rose 5% to 41.91 on the stock market today, clearing a 40.57 buy point in a 10-month cup base. LGI jumped as high as 42.78 just after the opening bell.The stock briefly peaked above the buy point on Monday and Wednesday, but couldn't close above it.Homebuilder stocks have faced headwinds in recent days as mortgage yields have ramped up quickly, following Treasury yields. That could make housing less affordable, pressuring sales and prices. But IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group has held its ground and is rated No. 3 out of 197 industries.LGI Homes helped lift homebuilders amid a broad market rally, with several housing stocks entering or near buy points.D.R. Horton (DHI) rose 3.8% to 35.79, clearing a 34.64 saucer-with-handle entry. D.R. Horton, one of the larger publicly traded homebuilders, has flirted with that buy point several times but has yet to close above it.Pulte Group (PHM) gained 2.2% to 24.94, now modestly extended from a 22.71 buy point. Pulte Group broke out of the cup-with-handle base in early June.Lennar (LEN) popped 3.1% to 53.48, rebounding from its 50-day moving average and closing in on a 53.89 buy point. Lennar rose as high as 53.88 intraday.Lennar moved past that entry a few times in June, just closing above that level on June 14, but then pulled back in late June.Taylor Morrison (TMHC) rose 2.35% to 24.40, rebounding from its 50-day line, where it's been finding support. Taylor Morrison last month tried to clear a 24.70 buy point from a flat base but never closed above it.IBD'S TAKE: LGI Homes is just the 5th-highest rated stock in IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial group, currently ranked No. 3 out of 197. See which are the very top builders, and how they measure up vs. objective criteria at IBD Stock Checkup.M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) advanced 2% to 35.57, moving back toward a 36.09 flat-base buy point. M.D.C. broke out on June 28, but reversed the following day.The above six builders all have solid Composite Ratings. LGI Homes has a 97 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 97% of all stocks based on proprietary IBD ratings including earnings. D.R. Horton also has a 97 CR, with Pulte at 96. Taylor Morrison and M.D.C. are at 98. Lennar lags somewhat with an 86.M/I Homes (MHO), Beazer Homes (BZH) and William Lyon Homes (WLH) also are in bases, working toward buy points.

126,DHI,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average edged higher early Wednesday ahead of a new wave of big earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.Strong results late Tuesday from Texas Instruments (TXN) and AT&T (T), are good news for Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem ahead of Apple's own earnings. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are among four IBD 50 stocks with earnings due Wednesday, with Facebook providing further evidence that is beating back Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).XThe Dow industrials rose 0.5% in Tuesday's regular session, led by earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as strength in financials. The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), closed just above break-even, but did hit a new all-time high. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3% to a fresh record.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit yet another record intraday low on Tuesday. VIX lows are a sign of investor complacency and often associated with at least short-term market tops.Still, S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.2% as equities generally advanced across the globe. Crude oil prices continued to climb after big gains Tuesday.The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes Wednesday afternoon, though policymakers could surprise and announce a plan to let the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet start to decline. Most analysts see that shift happening at the September meeting.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will build three plants in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before. Apple had no comment Tuesday. U.S. operations would ease political pressures, but would likely be more expensive. It's possible that Foxconn, a key assembler of iPhones, could set up some plant in America.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday and gave bullish guidance. Texas Instruments is big in automotive chips and many other segments, as well as in mobile devices like the Apple iPhone. But TI follows a beat-and-raise last week from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone chipmaker and an IBD 50 member.AT&T reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber figures, while churn hit a record low. That's a good sign for Apple iPhone sales during what could be a spring lull ahead of the iPhone 8 later this year. Relatively strong iPhone 7 demand is key, given the likelihood that the next-generation iPhone will be delayed.Apple shares edged higher in premarket trading. Apple closed up 0.4% to 152.73 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple is approaching a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Facebook, PayPal, Lam Research (LRCX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) are IBD 50 stocks reporting earnings on Wednesday. Also, Facebook, PayPal and Lam Research all boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means they outperform 99% of all other stocks based on proprietary fundamental and technical ratings. Big stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big price runs.Facebook will be the third FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet) stock to report Q2 results, following Alphabet late Monday and Netflix last week. Amazon is set to close out FANG earnings on Thursday.Facebook will presumably provide some new figures about the growing popularity of Instagram Stories and other offerings that clone Snapchat features. But here's a stat that's already out. Since Snap's March 1 IPO, Facebook's market capitalization has increased by about $81 billion to $479 billion. Snap's market value has retreated to just $16.4 billion. So Facebook has added the equivalent of nearly five Snapchats in Snap's brief history as a public firm.Facebook dipped 0.4% to 165.28 in Tuesday stock market trading after hitting a fresh record high on Monday. Facebook is extended from any possible entry. Snap fell 1.35% to 13.89, hitting a new record low.PayPal dipped 0.55% to 58.26, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 55.24 flat-base buy point cleared earlier this month. The mobile payments firm expanded its reach via deals this month with Apple and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Chip-equipment maker Lam Research is in cup base just below a possible buy point. Edwards Lifesciences has fallen back below a buy point in a big cup-with-handle base, undercutting its 50-day line on Tuesday.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), D.R. Horton (DHI), ServiceNow (NOW) and Fortinet (FTNT) are among the many other top-rated stocks set to report earnings Wednesday.RELATED:Texas Instruments, AMD Beat Q2 Targets, Guide HigherAT&T Q2 Adjusted Profit Beats, Pay-TV Video Subscribers FallWill Facebook Earnings Support Its Strong Stock Growth?The Big Picture: Nasdaq Lags On Alphabet Loss, But Industrials, Financials LeadHow To Win With Growth Stocks Like Netflix, Nvidia During Earnings

127,DHI,"As fellow homebuilder stocks D.R. Horton (DHI), Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) and MDC Holdings (MDC) test buy points, Pulte Group (PHM) is floating within buy range after breaking out last month.Pulte saw a positive improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Monday, with an increase from 76 to 81.IBD's unique RS Rating measures technical performance by showing how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks compares to that of the other stocks in our database.History shows that the best stocks often have an RS Rating of at least 80 in the early stages of their moves.Pulte Group is still inside a buying range after breaking past a 23.89 entry in a cup with handle. Once a stock moves 5% or higher beyond the original entry, it's considered extended and out of buy range.Earnings growth picked up last quarter from 18% to 29%. But revenue gains fell from 21% to 14%. The next quarterly results are expected on or around Jul. 21.The company earns the No. 8 rank among its peers in the Building-Residential/Commercial industry group.

128,DHI,"KB Home (KBH) topped fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates after the close Tuesday. That could trigger breakouts from four rival homebuilders: Lennar (LEN), MDC Holdings (MDC), D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH).Estimates: EPS to jump 53% to 26 cents, with sales up 13.7% to $922 million.Reported: EPS of 33 cents on revenue of $1 billion. Deliveries rose 11% to 2,580 homes. Average selling price increased 11% to $385,900. Net order value grew 15% to $1.38 billion on a 5% increase in net orders to 3,416. Backlog value rose 19% to $2.18 billion, as volume was up 8% to 5,612 homes. Adjusted homebuilding operating margin widened 90 basis points to 5.6%.X""The housing market recovery continues on a steady path, supported by favorable industry fundamentals,"" said Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Mezger in a statement. ""Recent improvements in consumer sentiment and employment, combined with relatively low mortgage interest rates, are signaling further strength in the demand for housing. At the same time, the supply of available homes in many areas across the country remains insufficient to satisfy current needs.""Stock: KB Home rallied 1.9% late. Shares closed up 0.6% at 22.91 on the stock market today, hitting a fresh four-year high intraday. The stock has been in profit-taking territory after a sharp run-up from its March breakout.Several other builders are also well-extended from breakouts. But a number are still in bases, or have set up after recent run-ups.Lennar, MDC Holdings, D.R. Horton and LGI Homes are all near buy points.On June 20, Lennar (LEN) reported fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue that were better than expected. Lennar initially hit a 22-month high and retook a buy point, but closed below that 53.89 entry, with shares pulling back modestly since then. Lennar shares fell 0.65% to 52.12.MDC finished 1.4% higher, while D.R. Horton dipped 0.5% and LGI Homes retreated 2.1%.Last month, Toll Bros. (TOL) reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 earnings, citing strong demand in ""affordable"" luxury homes. Toll Bros. is trading near 22-month highs.IBD'S TAKE: MDC Holdings could be ready to break out following peers NVR, KB Home, Toll Bros. and PulteGroup.Recent housing data have been mixed.Earlier this month, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, which will cause mortgage costs to climb and eventually hit homebuyers. But analysts aren't seeing an impact so far. Meanwhile, decent job and wage growth, along with millennials ready to start families, is supporting demand.Last Friday, new-home sales for May showed a 2.8% rise to a seasonally adjusted 610,000 units. The Commerce Department also revised its April numbers to 593,000 units from 569,000.On Wednesday, pending home sales data will come out.The homebuilder industry ranks No. 8 out of the 197 groups IBD tracks.RELATED: Homebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market & Real Estate NewsHomebuilder Stock With 126% Growth, 2.8% Dividend Near Buy Zone

132,DHI,"The Federal Reserve surprised markets with its relatively hawkish outlook Wednesday after raising interest rates for the second time in 2017. Most Fed policymakers still expect another rate hike in 2017, and three more next year. The central bank also said it will start to normalize its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet by year-end, with the details suggesting a slightly faster run-off that some had expectedBefore the Fed announcement, market pricing implied no more rate hikes for another year, and stocks did not react well to Fed hawkishness.The Fed's decision followed the latest in a series of surprisingly tame inflation reports. The Labor Department reported earlier in the day that core consumer price inflation, stripping out volatile food and energy prices, fell to a two-year low 1.7%.After the Fed's policy statement, the weak-Nasdaq, strong-Dow trade resumed as Fed Chair Janet Yellen elaborated on the U.S. central bank's views.The Nasdaq fell 0.7% in late afternoon trade, while the S&P 500 fell 0.25%. But the Dow industrials turned up 0.2%, helped by rebounding banks.Expectations of a slower rate-hike trajectory hit Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks ahead of the Fed announcement. But JPMorgan and Bank of America erased nearly all their losses by the close, with several banks turning positive.Housing-related stocks were among the lead performers on the stock market today ahead of the news, thanks to the benign rate outlook. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DRI) rose to a buy zone and hit an 11-year high, but pulled back somewhat as the markets soured.  Home Depot (HD), another Dow component, climbed 1.8%, rebounding from its 50-day line. Whirlpool (WHR) gained 1.4%.Fed policy expectations may continue to be volatile. On Tuesday, market participants were expecting the next rate hike by December. Before the announcement, they saw the Fed on hold until  next June. The 10-year Treasury hit the lowest level since the week of the November election and the 2-year yield saw its sharpest single-day drop since Brexit, but yields rebounded somewhat after the Fed statement.Even as the Fed has been on a tightening path, financial conditions have been easing, with the 10-year Treasury yield sinking about 50 basis points since mid-December.While economists still expect inflation to firm in the months ahead, their confidence in that outcome is waning after broad weakness in airline, apparel, auto and medical care costs.The Fed noted that inflation has been cooling, but Yellen said in her press conference that ebbing inflation appeared to be related to one-time changes, citing wireless data and prescription drug prices.""On a 12-month basis, inflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is running somewhat below 2%,"" the Fed said in its statement. The Fed lowered its inflation forecast for 2017 but expects inflation to hit its 2% target over the medium term.Separately, the Fed detailed how it plans to reduce its balance sheet gradually. It'll let some expiring assets roll off the balance sheet, starting with $10 billion a month, or $6 billion from Treasuries and $4 billion from mortgage-backed securities.Jefferies economists characterized the telegraphed balance-sheet reductions as ""fairly aggressive"" compared to expectations.The caps will rise every three months by $6 billion for Treasuries and $4 billion for MBS until they reach $30 billion and $20 billion, respectively.Officials didn't reveal the exact timing of when the process will begin this year, as well as specifically how large the portfolio might be when finished.The CME Group FedWatch tool showed that markets now don't expect the next rate hike until March 2018. At that point, the Fed will likely have a new leader, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's term ending in February.With job growth running ""well in excess"" of the trend growth in the labor force, Yellen said it's prudent to remove accommodation to avoid having to tighten too quickly later.RELATED:These Stunning Economic Reports Could Give Fed PauseBank Stocks Testing Key Levels Amid Fed, Weak DataThis Hot Sector Is Putting Stocks In Buy Range: Investing Action PlanHome Depot Finds Support In Buy Zone As Amazon Rattles Retailers

149,DHI,"The Federal Reserve hiked its key interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday, signaling that two more rate hikes are likely this year, just as financial markets were expecting.After a hawkish shift that had taken markets by surprise a few weeks back, it seems that the Fed and investors are on the same page, at least for now.With the Fed still projecting three rate hikes in 2018, Fed chief Janet Yellen said in her post-meeting press conference that policymakers' projections of future interest-rate policy were ""essentially unchanged"" since December.That signals the Fed isn't worried about being behind the curve, even as Yellen expressed her ""confidence in the path the economy's on,"" noting a somewhat firmer pace of business investment and acceleration in jobs gains to an average of about 200,000 per month added over the past three months.After the Fed's announcement, broad market indexes added to gains on the stock market today, and kept rising following Yellen's comments. The Dow industrials rose 0.5%, the S&P 500 index 0.8% and the Nasdaq composite 0.7%. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 hit an all-time high, with Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) all reaching record levels intraday.The 10-year Treasury yield fell nine basis points to 2.50%, after running up to its best levels in more than two years as markets priced in a March rate hike.Higher rates are generally a positive for financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Dow Jones industrial average components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which can reap higher net interest margins from a steeper yield curve. But with the Fed sticking to its rate hike schedule, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs turned slightly negative while JPMorgan Chase clung to a 0.2% gain.Faster monetary policy tightening could put further upward pressure on mortgage rates and might be a negative for shares of homebuilders like Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI). Still, even amid rising rates in recent weeks, the homebuilder group has been on fire, with Toll and Lennar among a raft of stocks breaking out of bases amid strong earnings and expectations for what is expected to be a strong spring selling season.The National Association of Home Builders said Wednesday that its Housing Market Index for March jumped to its best level in nearly 12 years.Toll, Lennar and D.R. Horton rallied about 1% after the Fed signaled just two more hikes in 2017.A proactive Fed also could continue to drag down gold miners like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX). The price of gold has slumped close to 5% since late February as the market priced in a faster pace of rate hikes and the dollar has strengthened. But gold prices firmed after the Fed release while the dollar retreated.IBD'S TAKE: Just three weeks ago, odds of a rate hike at the March meeting looked slim. Yet Fed policymakers have recently signaled impatience to keep raising interest rates, even as the prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing.Markets had been anticipating a rate hike since a series of hawkish Fed policymaker comments on Feb. 28 turned expectations for the March meeting upside down. Fed Chair Janet Yellen, widely seen as among the more dovish members of the rate-setting committee, sealed expectations with her March 3 speech saying a rate hike this month would likely be appropriate. She also endorsed Fed members' December projection of three rate hikes in 2017 as likely to be appropriate.President Trump still has three Fed governor openings to fill, so it's very possible that the makeup of the committee will get more hawkish as the year progresses. Still, economic data will be the biggest factor. Yellen noted in her recent speech, which came before March's 235,000 job gain, that recent job growth of around 180,000 per month is ""notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.""In December, Yellen was widely believed to be among the doves projecting just two rates hikes in 2017. With Yellen having moved to the center, the big question going into the meeting was whether the center itself would move in a more hawkish direction. That could happen if the job market stays as hot as it has been the past couple of months, but the new Fed projections should give markets some comfort. Here's why: Back in December, there were 5 Fed committee members expecting four or more rate hikes in 2017. The new statement shows that there are still only five hawks, while nine members projected a total of three hikes in 2017 and three members saw even slower tightening.Yellen noted that expectations for future rate hikes were based on incoming economic information, rather than seen as a preemptive way to combat inflation that might percolate if Trump and Congress pass an economic stimulus program. She added that the rate-setting committee will have plenty of time to respond once the fiscal policy outlook becomes clear.RELATED:Oil Up, Metals Stocks Jump; These 5 Sectors Are Rising After Fed Rate HikeJPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Pare Gains After Fed Rate HikeFebruary Jobs Growth Strong, But Not Too Strong To Unnerve Investors, FedYellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017Fed March Rate Hike Odds Double As Dudley Says Move 'CompellingS'
"
150,DHI,"The Federal Reserve has been full of surprises lately, and there's good reason to expect another on Wednesday.Back in December, 11 of 17 members of the Fed's policy committee were expecting at least three rate hikes in 2017, and 5 members were expecting at least four hikes.Earlier this month, Fed Chair Janet Yellen, undoubtedly among those December doves penciling in two rate hikes, made clear that she now sees three hikes as appropriate. As Yellen moved to the center, the big question is whether the center itself moved. It wouldn't take much — perhaps only half of the six members who expected exactly three hikes in December to up their expectation by one notch.With the 10-year Treasury yield just below its highest levels since the spring of 2014, a shift in Fed expectations to four rate hikes this year might be the catalyst for a breakout to the upside. That might be good news for financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Dow Jones industrial average components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which can reap higher net interest margins from rising interest rates and a steeper yield curve. But it might be a negative for shares of homebuilders like Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI).In the past few weeks, BofA, JPMorgan and Goldman have consolidated as Treasury yields have soared. Meanwhile, the homebuilder group has been on fire, with Toll and Lennar among a raft of stocks breaking out of bases amid strong earnings and expectations for what is expected to be a strong spring selling season. But a further jump in market rates may begin to dampen the outlook.A more proactive Fed also could continue to drag down gold miners like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX). The price of gold has slumped close to 5% over the past two weeks as the market has priced in a faster pace of rate hikes and the dollar has strengthened.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve is getting impatient to raise interest rates even though prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing.Already, the Fed's hawkish turn has been both sudden and pretty dramatic. After Yellen spent most of 2016 worrying aloud that the Fed was low on ammunition to combat a downturn, the first surprise came in December. While hiking rates a quarter-point as expected, Fed members' own projections indicated a likelihood of three rate hikes in 2017 — one more than projected in September.Yet markets didn't begin buying into the three rate-hike outlook until a series of hawkish Fed policymaker comments two weeks ago turned expectations for the March meeting upside down. Yellen sealed the rate hike with her March 3 speech saying a rate hike this month would likely be appropriate. She also endorsed the December projection of three rate hikes in 2017 as likely to be appropriate, assuming that the economy doesn't flash unexpected weakness.While Fed members' individual projections are anonymous, Fed watchers assumed in December that Yellen was among the doves. One fewer Fed member will make projections this month, with the retirement of Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart. He was probably among the doves, though that's not quite as clear.President Trump still has three Fed governor openings to fill, so it's very possible that the makeup of the committee will get more hawkish as the year progresses. Still, economic data will be the biggest factor. If the outlook doesn't shift to four 2017 rate hikes this month, more employment reports with 200,000-plus jobs added would certainly move the Fed in that direction by June.Currently, markets see a 56% chance of a second rate hike by the June meeting, with a third move likely but by no means assured as of December.RELATED:Yellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017Fed March Rate Hike Odds Double As Dudley Says Move 'Compelling' ISM Manufacturing Index Surges To 30-Month High, Fueling Fed Hawks

157,DHI,"As Don Huffines sees it, Donald Trump's election instantly made his Dallas-area pastureland much more valuable. That's because the residential developer expects the president-elect to follow through on a pledge to cut through what he considers environmental red tape.Huffines, a Republican state senator in Texas, blames President Obama's administration for adding to rules protecting wetlands, stream beds, endangered species and clean water. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been blocking a dam to create a lake he envisions as a centerpiece for the 1,000-home subdivision.Trump, the first builder ever to occupy the White House, is stirring hope in the hearts of developers like Huffines that America's lost decade for home construction will end in a flurry of regulatory cuts. And they're brushing off concerns that Trump will worsen the construction labor shortage by deporting millions, or that its inflation-stoking policies will hurt demand by increasing borrowing rates.Builders say regulation is driving up housing costs as homeownership hovers near a 51-year low. Ben Carson, Trump's nominee for housing secretary, on Jan. 12 endorsed this view, saying it is contributing to inequality by locking low-income people out of the market. The industry calculates that a quarter of a home's cost stems from government regulation.""He can rein in these out-of-control federal agencies,"" Huffines said of Trump. ""The biggest risk to the housing market right now is the government.""Some caution to hold off on buying the furniture. Many economists blame tightening mortgage-approval standards after the housing collapse for the anemic growth of single-family construction, still less than half of 2006 levels. Public support for easing environmental laws is also far from assured, and some academics say the industry overstates the costs of federal regulation.Homebuilders have complained about the Endangered Species and Clean Water acts since they were enacted in the 1970s, yet have still prospered since when the economy was strong, according to Joseph Laquatra, professor emeritus of housing and environmental analysis at Cornell University.Laquatra said there's no evidence that federal government rules are making housing unaffordable, or that it's responsible for holding back construction.""Regulations are there so you don't have workers fall off roofs,'' Laquatra said. Without them, ""you'd see species go away and you'd see groundwater contamination because there's construction on wetlands.''Still, confidence among builders surged after the election to an 11-year high in December, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo sentiment index. Investors are optimistic, too. Bloomberg's homebuilder stock index, which includes companies such as Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI), has surged 12% since the election, twice as much as the broader market.""There's a spring in the step of the builders,"" said Carl Harris, a Kansas subcontractor and former government-affairs chair of the industry trade group. ""They feel a lot more confident and they're a lot more willing to go out there and expand.''Harris and his peers remember well Trump's words during the National Association of Home Builders' board of directors meeting in Miami last August.""What's happening with regulations, horrible — 25% (of) the cost of a house"" is due to regulation, Trump said. ""I think we should get that down to about 2%.""The industry may be paying too little attention to another side of Trump's agenda: restricting immigration. Pew Research Center estimates put the proportion of construction jobs now held by undocumented workers at 14%.""The builders also fear that tighter immigration policies would reduce housing demand and exacerbate the current labor shortage,'' said Irvine, Calif.-based homebuilding consultant John Burns.There's also the matter of public support. Almost two-thirds of U.S. adults say stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost, according to a Pew survey last year.The Trump administration said it would nominate Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who is a climate-change skeptic, to head the Environmental Protection Agency, a decision that the National Association of Home Builders said ""will restore common sense to the regulatory process.""Among other targets, the homebuilders group wants the EPA to scale back recent rules that expand the definition of wetlands and thereby increase the need for permits.Nathan Hultman, a University of Maryland professor who worked in the Obama White House on climate and energy policy, said builders may be overestimating Trump's ability to shrink regulations.Changes require public-comment periods, and repeal can take years. Environmental groups will be ready to file lawsuits if the Trump administration stops enforcing existing laws. Many regulations are local, as well.""There's always the possibility they slow-walk and not enforce existing regulation,"" Hultman said. ""But, for the first couple years, it's going to be tough to unroll everything that was done in the last eight.''RELATED:Why Are Developers Still Sinking Billions Into Waterlogged Miami?Homebuilding Lots Now Less Available Than Ever, NAHB SaysArtificial Lakes Floated As A Solution To Real-World Problems

But shares of homebuilders rallied Thursday morning as Pulte Group (PHM) was the latest to report strong quarterly earnings.Single-family house sales dropped 10.4%, the most in almost two years, to a 536,000 annualized pace, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for 588,000.The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reached 4.32% at the end of December, the highest since April 2014, according to Freddie Mac figures. That was up from 3.54% just before the Nov. 8 election. It was 4.09% in the week ended Jan. 19.Optimism about President Trump's plans to spur economic growth through tax cuts and looser regulation triggered a rise in Treasury yields and a corresponding increase in mortgage rates. The Federal Reserve is also projected to raise its benchmark interest rate several times this year.The supply of homes for sale increased to 5.8 months, the highest since September 2015, from 5 months in November. There were 259,000 new houses on the market at the end of December, the most since 2009.However, Pulte Group, which mainly sells single-family homes, earned 67 cents excluding various items, up 18% and beating views for 59 cents. Revenue climbed 21% to $2.42 billion.

That makes them a timelier barometer than transactions on existing homes.Sales of previously-owned homes declined in December while closing the strongest year since 2006, National Association of Realtors data showed Tuesday. Contract closings, which reflect signings made a month or two earlier, fell 2.8% to a 5.49 million annual rate, as inventory declined to the lowest since 1999.

Gross margins narrowed slightly to 19.8% from 19.9% in the year-ago quarter on higher warranty and litigation costs. The company sees average gross margins of 20% for the current housing market.D.R. Horton reaffirmed its full year guidance of revenue of $13.4 billion to $13.8 billion, in line with analyst views for $13.56 billion, with home closings of 43,500 to 45,500.Also out Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors said that existing-home sales fell 2.8% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 5.49 million, below views for 5.55 million. That was partly due to higher prices. But existing homes for sale tumbled 10.8% to 1.65 million, the lowest since NAR began tracking these data in 1999.Tight existing-home supplies are good news for homebuilders and new-home prices.IBD'S TAKE: Homebuilders KB Home, Pulte Group and others are bullish that President Donald Trump will make the housing market great again. D.R. Horton shares climbed 6.6% to 30.64 on the stock market today, above their 200-day moving average.Top homebuilder stocks, Beazer Homes (BZH) shares vaulted 8.9% to 13.87 and KB Home (KBH) shares were up 2.9% to 16.75.

177,DHI,"When you receive a generous gift, it's usually in poor taste to ask for more. However, investors do it all the time.D.R. Horton (DHI) provided IBD's SwingTrader with a nice gift after it was added on July 7 (1). It was part of a bullish move among homebuilders while the market was trying to find its footing after the Nasdaq composite breached its 50-day moving average for just the second time this year.XThe day after being added amid a 3.8% gain, D.R. Horton had its price target raised by Argus Research lifting the stock to a 4.6% profit at its peak for the day (2). Profits were taken on the entire position at 4% rather than holding out for a 5% or even 10% profit goal. You might wonder, why sell so early? What about letting winners run and trying to get more out of the stock? Whatever happened to greed is good?Looking back on the history of D.R. Horton, a 7% move in the span of two days was unusually strong behavior, especially without an earnings report acting as a catalyst. We tend to take notice when a stock changes character. Also, while the market was improving — the Nasdaq just got back above its 50-day moving average line — there hadn't been much of a correction. That left the risk of the market taking another leg down. Booking a solid 4% profit seemed prudent rather than getting greedy and asking for more.That sell ended up being near a short-term top. After dropping slightly, the stock hit the 4% profit level again but then reversed more sharply (3). If it hadn't been sold earlier, this would have been the time to step out. After that, D.R. Horton remained positive from the entry on SwingTrader as it began hugging its 5-day moving average line. The closes didn't stray far from the line, but some of the intraday action would have been challenging and it eventually closed below the 10-day moving average line (4).It would be easy to justify holding the stock through all this. You never turned negative on the trade and it seemed that getting to the previous level or beyond wasn't far-fetched. However, that also meant that after nearly two weeks you were worse off than locking in the gain early. While there are plenty of examples where that kind of start can turn into a huge winner, having a sense of what the market will give you and the stock's normal behavior will help you get the most pleasure out of your gifts.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Taking Profits: Knowing When To Say WhenProfit-Taking Rules Spur Action Over Hesitation In Swing TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

New-home sales are more timely.Mortgage applications for buying a home actually rose significantly after the presidential election, which sent mortgage yields flying.With job growth steady and wage growth generally trending higher, housing demand should stay solid. But some of November's gain in home sales and mortgage applications may reflect Americans rushing to buy a house before rates rise even further.Sales in the Midwest skyrocketed 43.8%, while sales in the West rose 7.7% to their best pace since January 2008. New-home sales fell in the South for a fourth straight month.The supply of homes fell to 5.1 months' worth from 5.2 months in October. There are 250,000 new homes on the market, the most since 2009. The median sales price fell 3.7% vs. a year earlier to $305,400.As for homebuilder stocks, LGI Homes (LGIH) rose 0.9% on the stock market today. KB Home (KBH), Toll Brothers (TOL), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM) edged lower.RELATED:Existing-Home Sales Make A Surprise Jump, Prices Up 6.8%

180,DHI,"Lennar (LEN) on Monday reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that beat expectations, and the homebuilder said it was well positioned to benefit from economic growth under a Trump presidency despite the prospect of rising interest rates. But shares reversed morning gains after Lennar signaled caution about its gross margins.Earnings per share during the quarter rose 10% to $1.34, topping views for $1.29. Revenue increased 15% to $$3.376 billion, above estimates for $3.304 billion.Deliveries rose 7%, new orders rose 9%, and the company's backlog of homes rose 15%.Lennar said it believes a ""slow and steady recovery"" of the housing market is continuing.""With the anticipation of a new President focusing on accelerating economic growth, we believe that our fortified balance sheet, our diversified business model and our refined product offerings, will continue to hold us in good stead in a high-growth economy, despite the potential of moderately rising interest rates over the next several years,"" CEO Stuart Miller said in a statement.Lennar's optimism jibes with the NAHB Housing Market Index, which showed homebuilder confidence soaring in December to an 11-year high.That comes despite November's 18.7% dive in housing starts after they surged to a nine-year high in October. Multifamily starts have been especially volatile.IBD'S TAKE: As Lennar keeps its hopes high for the incoming president, an array of construction and steel stocks have also risen since the election on Trump's plans to overhaul the nation's infrastructure. But during Lennar's post-earnings conference call with analysts, executives signaled caution about gross margins. It sees fiscal 2017 gross margins of 22%-22.5 vs. 23.3% in fiscal Q4 and 24.6% in Q4 2015.Lennar shares, up more than 3% intraday, closed down 2 cents to 43.40 in the stock market today. The stock is hovering below its 200-day line, which remains above the stock's 50-day line.Shares of other builders also pared gains. KB Home (KBH) fell 0.7%, D.R.

"
181,DHI,"The Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday, as expected, but policymakers signaled a likelihood of three increases in 2017, up from prior expectations for two moves.In her post-meeting press conference, Chair Janet Yellen called the change in outlook ""a very modest adjustment"" in the path of Fed policy.She noted that some members, but not all, factored in some fiscal stimulus following the election of Donald Trump, into their forecasts, even though his policies are still being crafted. The lower jobless rate, which fell to 4.6% from 4.9% in November, also was behind the more hawkish outlook.The Fed decision comes as economic growth is on the upswing and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is at a 10-year high. Major stock indexes have surged to record highs amid hopes for President-elect Trump's agenda of tax cuts, an infrastructure-spending binge and regulatory relief.The outlook for better growth, higher rates and a steeper yield curve has propelled shares of big banks, with Goldman Sachs (GS) vaulting to levels unseen since November 2007, before the financial crisis struck. Bank of America (BAC) has set an 8-year best while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has rocketed to an all-time high.However, Yellen said that a ""fiscal boost"" is  ""not obviously needed to get back to full employment,"" in response to a question about whether tax cuts would help the economy and productivity.The major averages initially rose slightly on the stock market today following the Fed's announcement, then turned lower, with the S&P 500 down 0.8%. Goldman, BofA and JPMorgan first extended their gains, then gave up ground with the broader market to turn roughly flat. The 10-year Treasury yield shot up to a 2-year high of 2.57%. The dollar rose against most currencies, hitting a 10-month high against the yen.When Fed policymakers last detailed their economic projections in September, they signaled two more quarter-point rate hikes in the coming year and three additional hikes in 2018. Any indication that the Fed is getting antsy about inflation pressures and ready to rapidly speed up this timetable likely wouldn't go down well with markets. But policymakers were unexpected to take a hawkish turn right on the heels of the election when there's so much uncertainty about the size and thrust of the tax and spending package that President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress will pass.IBD'S TAKE: Optimism is running high over Donald Trump's agenda of lower taxes and more infrastructure spending, yet there are three big factors that could limit what he can accomplish: 1) High deficits and strict budget rules; 2) A tight job market; and 3) A possibility of rising trade tensions that could backfire on U.S. employers.While Yellen said that some members factored a Trump fiscal package into their rate-policy projections, that didn't have much of an effect on members' GDP projections. The median forecast is for 2.1% growth in 2017 and 2.0% in 2018, little changed from the September forecast of 2.0% growth in each year. Yet even Fed policymakers who didn't incorporate Trump tax cuts and infrastructure spending in their outlook probably did factor in the stock-market surge that reflects the Trump agenda.In September, 10 of 15 Fed members projected two (or fewer) rate hikes in 2017. The new projections show 5 of 15 members now see only two rate hikes. Yet Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, says he's ""very confident"" that Yellen and the other most influential policy committee members are among the doves.""Some dots (projections) are simply more important than others,"" Bandholz wrote. ""We thus stick to our forecast of two hikes in 2017.""While Yellen has previously encouraged a more expansionary fiscal policy, she said that now, with the labor market near full employment, the benefit of fiscal stimulus was less obvious. However, she added that lawmakers had to consider a number of factors in setting fiscal policy, including debt levels, and that she was not advising against stimulative policy.Before the announcement, the 10-year Treasury yield had surged nearly 60 basis points to 2.43% since the election, pushing mortgage rates to a two-year high, which is probably a modest negative for homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN).Shares of D.R. Horton and Lennar extended modest losses after the Fed decision, both closing down nearly 3%.For most sectors, the benefits of better growth are outweighing the drag from higher interest rates, but DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said in an investor webcast on Tuesday that he thinks the positives may begin to fade if rapid rise in Treasury yields continues.""We're getting to the point where further rises in Treasuries, certainly above 3%, would start to have a real impact on market liquidity in corporate bonds and junk bonds (and) bring into question some of the aspects of the stock market and of the housing market in particular.""RELATED:Bank Stocks Mixed Despite Fed's More Aggressive Rate-Hike ViewNovember Retail Sales Rose Just 0.1%: No Trump Holiday Bump?As Trumponomics Cheers Wall Street, Economists FretWhat's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?

189,DHI,"In an odd year for the homebuilding trade, most of the big-name builders have reported their quarterly results, and the housing market continues to struggle like a big dog on a leash.While no homebuilding stocks are currently listed on either the IBD 50 or the Sector Leader lists, a total of five homebuilding names have earned a spot on IBD's Your Weekly Review list: KB Home (KBH), NVR (NVR), LGI Homes (LGIH), M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) and Toll Brothers (TOL).Your Weekly Review (see it in the Stock Lists section of Investors.com) casts a slightly broader net for leading stocks, in terms of the vetting process, when compared to the other two lists. The process often turns up gems, but these must be researched with a bit more diligence that the more stringently screened Sector Leaders or IBD 50.Homebuilders stocks absolutely fit that profile.The 25 stocks collected in the homebuilding group turned in a collective gain of more than 48%  for the year through Friday. That has earned the stocks a steady top 10 ranking over the past 13 weeks among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.IBD'S TAKE: Track industry group charts and ratings like a pro using IBD's MarketSmith: a pro-grade arsenal of investment research programs and data. Also, see this Investor's Corner column on how to employ MarketSmith to spot early signs of large sector rotation and catch new breakouts among emerging growth companies.But the industry is turning in confusing data.Lennar (LEN) has now posted two quarters of earnings declines (-75% and -4%) despite accelerating revenue growth. Pulte Group (PHM) reported that earnings growth rebounded in its first and second quarters (from 18% to 29% and 27%), while revenue growth slowed (from 21% to 14% and 12%).The industry's largest name, D.R. Horton (DHI), reported that both sales and earnings growth slowed in its fiscal third quarter and its gains in new orders eased to 11.3% in a second-straight quarterly decline.M.D.C. Holdings reports Tuesday morning. LGI reports next Monday, and Toll Brothers has not yet announced a date for its fiscal Q3 report.The National Association of Realtors on Monday released stronger-than-expected numbers for pending home sales — houses under signed contracts, a gauge of upcoming sales activity for existing homes — in June. The more critical numbers to homebuilding stocks are sales of new homes.June new-homes sales inched up 0.8%, but growth was revised lower in March, April and May. Housing starts bounded 8%, building permits jumped 7% — both strong gains, but with the overall numbers remaining far below levels expected from a healthy market.We should be building total housing starts to 1.2 to 1.4 million, and we are only running at about 1.15 to 1.185 million,"" said analyst Jade Rahmani with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ""So there is about a 100,000-to-300,000-unit cushion of potential undersupply.""Why? Competition for limited land and labor is constraining the construction industry's output. At the same time, costs are rising — not just for labor and land, but for materials and services, including Canadian lumber, on which import tariffs of up to 24% were slapped in April, with another round reportedly on the way.The environment favors big homebuilders, Rahmani says.""We think the public homebuilders can take market share from privates, because they have better access to capital, and they can just tack onto their existing communities,"" he said.Rahmani favors Lennar and D.R. Horton over small- to mid-cap builders. These ""have the potential to face margin pressure as a result of increasing land costs and increasing building materials costs and labor inflation,"" Rahmani said.But recent gains in market shares have generally taken place below the level of the top 10 largest national builders, says Robert Dietz, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders.""There has been some growth (in market share) among the top 20 share or the top 100 share,"" he said. ""The top 10 share has been roughly constant at about a quarter of home sales.""Results from small-cap builders M.D.C. and LGI Homes could be telling. Chartwise, M.D.C. remains in play after a brief breakout above a 36.09 buy point in a six-week flat base. Shares pulled back below the buy point, but stopped short of the 7% to 8% level that would trigger the automatic sell rule.The stock did break below its 50-day moving average in above-average volume. That is a sell signal, but not a hard-and-fast sell rule. That means the stock remains in play. A move back above the 36.09 level in heavy trade would mark a buy opportunity.Shares of LGI are extended after a third rebound from 10-week support since a breakout from a cup base in January.The Commerce Department reports July housing starts and building permits data on Aug. 16, and July new home sales numbers on Aug. 23.RELATED:Spotlight Countdown: 4 Buy Points, 3 Earnings Reports On The WayThis Homebuilder Wins By Wooing New Entrants To HomeownershipNo. 2-Ranked Homebuilder Constructs Successful BreakoutThese IBD 50 Leaders Are Basing As Earnings Come Due 
"
190,DHI,"Donald Trump's economic policies, uncertain as they are, have sent the stock market to new highs, but are the days of slow growth really over?While economists are boosting their GDP forecasts for 2017, they are by no means expecting a boom. And some are worried that the gains from tax cuts and more infrastructure spending may be relatively short-lived.Economists are hardly of one mind, and their views should be taken with an even bigger grain of salt than usual given that Trump and Republicans in Congress have yet to show their cards. Still, investors should understand the high degree of difficulty of the maneuver the incoming administration is about to undertake.Consider that the Ronald Reagan boom fueled by tax cuts and defense spending started when interest rates and unemployment had nowhere to go but down, whereas Federal Reserve economists now think the U.S. is close to full employment and the 10-year Treasury yield sank to a historic low of 1.34% in July. In other words, rates have nowhere to go but up and the jobless rate may not be able to fall much without increasing inflation pressure.The spike in interest rates since Trump's election — the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.33% on Monday despite pulling back from last week's 16-month high — will cut total home sales (new and existing) by 5% from October's nine-year high over the next several months, wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.That can't be good news for big homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and Pulte Group (PHM), and the sector has been a laggard during the postelection stock market rally. Still, Shepherdson says, the economic impact of slower housing market activity will be modest for three reasons. The sector makes up a much smaller share of GDP than it did before the mortgage crisis. Further, retailers of building materials and appliances , such as Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD), will only feel the effect of the housing slowdown on a lagged basis, perhaps not until the spring of 2018.But the big reason that the economy won't sweat higher rates next year is the coming fiscal boost courtesy of Trump and the GOP Congress. While Shepherdson thinks tax cuts are more likely to pass than an infrastructure spending package, he notes that the Tax Policy Center's measure of Trump's corporate and individual income-tax cuts comes to $198 billion in fiscal 2017.""Even if half of that money is saved, the boost to GDP growth would be some 0.5 percentage point, more than offsetting the housing hit,"" Shepherdson wrote.Shepherdson said he's upped his GDP growth forecast to 3.25% in 2017. Yet, the election forecast also led to his ""sharply weaker forecast for the second half of 2018,"" because he expects the fiscal boost to lead to higher inflation.IBD'S TAKE: As markets reassess prospects for faster growth, stocks like Freeport-McMoRan, Nucor and Martin Marietta are consolidating postelection gains. Read The Big Picture every day to find out whether the rally has further to run. And check out IBD Leaderboard to look for insight on stock standouts.The big uncertainty is whether the tax cuts encourage a substantial increase in labor-force participation, as Trump's advisors expect. In that case, faster growth won't fuel an overshoot in inflation that leads the Federal Reserve to step up its pace of rate hikes.""We can't know what will happen to the labor market in the face of substantial fiscal stimulus,"" Shepherdson admits, but he's worried that companies will continue to have trouble finding workers who have the skills they need.Another possibility is that the GOP could create more slack in the labor market by changing work-reducing incentives, including the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer coverage to workers clocking 30 hours per week and the Obama administration overtime rule that a federal judge just put on hold.Shepherdson is hardly alone in worrying that a GOP burst of tax-cut and spending fuel is coming at a less-than-ideal time. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in a Nov. 17 appearance before Congress, interpreted the bond-market reaction to Trump's election as factoring in the potential ""inflationary consequences"" from enacting a stimulus when the economy was ""relatively close to maximum employment.""Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, figures that the Trump tax cuts and infrastructure spending worth $650 billion over two years could add up to 0.9 percentage point to annual GDP growth, though the same package could have had twice as much bang for the buck if enacted during a recession.A third big difference between the task facing Trump and the one that faced Reagan is that publicly held federal debt has more than doubled as a share of GDP. That raises the risk that Trump and the GOP Congress will fire their fiscal bullets, leading the economy to overheat, resulting in ""a deeper recession"" because there's less fiscal space to help revive growth several years down the line.It's unclear whether concerns about the budget will limit Trump's coming infrastructure spending package, which has led investors to snap up shares of copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and steel maker Nucor (NUE).Not everyone is so concerned about the timing of the coming fiscal expansion. In fact, the 35-nation Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday urged policymakers to seize ""a unique window of opportunity to make more active use of fiscal levers to boost growth and reduce inequality without compromising debt levels.""The group sees U.S. growth picking up to 2.3% in 2017 and 3% in 2018.Beyond the issue of timing, economists have big concerns over what steps Trump will take regarding immigration and trade. Moody's Analytics figures that deportations and a less-welcoming environment for unauthorized immigrants under Trump could reduce the labor force by 2.16 million workers. Since GDP growth equals the increase in hours worked plus productivity growth, that would be a negative.Trade is an even bigger wild card. The possibilities range from Trump using his bully pulpit to get Ford (F) and United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep work in the U.S. to a growth-killing trade war.The forecast from Jefferies & Co. economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons may be about as good as it gets for Republicans trying to protect or expand their majorities in the 2018 elections: GDP growth of around 3% in 2018, with a jobless rate of 4% and the personal consumption expenditures inflation at a manageable 2.5%.""Donald Trump's domestic fiscal policy proposals are pro-growth and will promote a stronger consumer sector (and) improved labor-market conditions for semiskilled and unskilled workers,"" they wrote. ""Reduced regulation will also free resources for more productive uses.""RELATED:What's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?Trump Makes 'Progress' On Indiana Carrier Plant, Using Twitter Bully Pulpit

But builders were cheered by the prospect that the real estate mogul will be in the White House.Shares of Toll Bros. (TOL), D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH) initially rose but 0.6%, 2.1% and 3%, respectively.The consumer price index rose 0.2% in November, the Labor Department said. That's in line with views and follows October's 0.4% gain. It was the fourth straight monthly increase, with housing and gasoline fueling November's advance. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, climbed 0.2%.Year over year, consumer prices climbed 1.7%, the most in two years. Core inflation edged up to 2.2%.The Fed has a 2% inflation target, though it's favorite price gauge, the core PCE deflator, is still not at that level.

197,DHI,"Sales of previously owned U.S. homes unexpectedly climbed in October to the highest level since February 2007, a sign of momentum in the housing market a month before a jump in borrowing costs, National Association of Realtors data showed Tuesday.Existing-home sales rose 2% to a 5.60 million annual rate, above views for about 5.44 million. The median sales price rose 6% vs. a year earlier to $232,000.The supply of available homes fell 4.3% vs. October 2015 to 2.02 million, the 17th straight year-over-year decline. At the current pace, it would take 4.3 months to sell the houses on the market, the quickest since January and down from 4.4 months in September. NAR deems six months' supply as normal.Credit steady job growth and accelerating wage gains for fueling demand despite limited inventory that's pushing up prices.But housing demand may falter going forward. October existing-home sales reflect contracts signed a month or two earlier. Since then, mortgage rates have risen sharply, especially since Donald Trump's surprise election win sent Treasury yields soaring. The 30-year mortgage rate has risen to a three-year high.That could curb home buying, especially from millennials and other first-time buyers.The October advance ""may be indicative of pent-up demand that was unrealized in the summer,"" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the Realtors group in Washington, told reporters as the data were released. More recently, ""with the rise in rates, we may begin to see some modest reduction in home sales."" As long as there's job creation, the impact should be ""minimal.""Mortgage applications tumbled last week to their lowest level since January, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.""This is all very encouraging, but it has to be seen in the context of the recent decline in mortgage applications, which if sustained likely will push home sales down sharply in the early part of next year,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd., said in a note. ""We expect further declines in demand as rates climb.Housing-related stocks were mixed. Tuesday afternoon.LGI Homes (LGIH) advanced 2.6% and KB Home (KBH) 0.7%. But D.R.

201,DHI,"Here's your weekly Investing Action Plan: what you need to know as an investor for the coming week.Markets around the world will look to the results of the U.S. presidential race, which has tightened in the past week. Earnings season slows down but highly rated stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), NetEase (NTES) and Acacia Communications (ACIA) will report, along with Walt Disney (DIS) and department store chains. Also keep an eye on shares of Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB).Political scores will finally be settled on Tuesday, when Americans vote. Stock indexes in the U.S. and elsewhere sold off over the past week as poll numbers showed Hillary Clinton's once-comfortable lead over Donald Trump shrinking or even disappearing. The S&P 500 dropped for eight consecutive sessions, marking its longest losing streak since the financial crisis in 2008.Some analysts believe that the possibility of a Trump victory still isn't fully priced into markets, suggesting a further dive if he wins Tuesday night. Results of House and Senate races will also determine how much gridlock the next president could face. But close calls in key battleground states may add another wrinkle, if any recounts delay a final result for the presidential contest.With the market uptrend under pressure and distribution days piling up, growth stocks presenting actionable buying opportunities have been few and far between. But three names — VMWare (VMW), T-Mobile (TMUS) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) — are trading in or near buy range.IBD 50 member VMWare, a provider of corporate data center software, jumped past a 77.09 buy point from a flat base after issuing an estimate-beating quarterly report on Oct. 26.

The video game publisher is now 3% above the buy point, with a stock's buy range extending 5% past a buy point.Meanwhile, tech giants Facebook and Apple have been trading lower since issuing their quarterly earnings reports.Facebook triggered sell signals after plunging well below its 132.08 and 128.43 buy points. The stock is 9.6% below its all-time high reached Oct. 25. And after breaching its 50-day line, the social media leader is now looking for support at the 200-day line.Apple hit its lowest level since mid-September on Friday after breaking below the 50-day line several sessions prior. With a loss of 4.3% for the week, the iPhone maker's shares are now below a 110.33 buy point initially cleared several weeks ago.RELATED:Facebook, Alphabet Fall Below Recent Buy PointsCloud Deals Drive Top Software Stock To HighsThe graphics chipmaker is expected to post its sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating sales growth when it reports Q3 earnings on Thursday.

TripAdvisor (TRIP) reports early Wednesday, and EPS is seen flat at 53 cents, on 5% revenue growth to $436 million. Hurricane Matthew and the strong dollar may weigh on results.

205,DHI,"Stocks continue to catch their breath on Monday after posting big gains last week, but Apple (AAPL) made a statement in the stock market today — that the institutional crowd is not yet ready to cash in their large year-to-date gains.X While the Dow Jones industrial average inched barely higher and the Nasdaq composite was fractionally lower with less than half an hour to go, Apple rose more than 0.3% to 149.55, climbing back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since a two-day, 5.3% slide on June 9-12. Shares on Monday got as high as 150.90.The seventh up day in a row for the iPhone and iPad maker suggests that Apple is not only trying to keep its uptrend intact but also may try to form a genuine new base.Apple (72 EPS Rating, 84 RS in Stock Checkup) initially cleared a 118.12 proper entry in a cup-with-handle pattern on Jan. 6-9 and rallied more than 32% before cooling off. The company is into its third quarter of rebounding from a three-quarter slump in both the top and bottom lines.IBD's TAKE: A savvy investor can get an edge in finding new entry points in turnaround stocks and strong companies at the end of a severe market correction by looking for the bottoming base pattern. Check out the one that Apple formed in the spring of 2009 before going on its big stretch run of gains.An aggressive shareholder could opt to buy shares of Apple if it can continue to rally back above the 50- or 10-week moving average with authority, preferably in rising volume. (The 50-day average turnover of Apple is 28.1 million shares.) A more clear-cut entry would be if the stock breaks out to new highs.The S&P 500 was virtually flat, as gains in steel, metal ores, retail, gold and generic drug firms offset declines in the automaker, airfreight, specialty retail, logistics, railroad and movie fields of the market. The Russell 2000 outperformed, up 0.3%.Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, notes that low inflation, a U.S. monetary policy that ""should remain equity-market friendly,"" and a global monetary policy that is beginning to normalize all pose as positive factors for equities in the second half of 2017.""We think these trends can continue, but also believe investment selectivity is growing more important,"" Doll wrote in a weekly investment commentary.Indeed, the IBD Mutual Fund index, which tracks some of the best active fund managers on Wall Street, is up 15.8% since Jan. 1, pounding the S&P 500's 9.8% gain so far. See the index and its components by going to the latest IBD Big Picture and clicking on the General Market Indicators page via a link at the bottom of the daily article.Apple is slated to report fiscal Q3 results on Aug. 1 after the close. The Street sees sales rising 6% to $44.92 billion, which would mark the biggest year-over-year increase in seven quarters. Earnings are expected to lift 11% to $1.57 a share.Apple is part of IBD's Telecom sector. As seen in IBD Weekly, Electronics, Chips, Leisure and Building dominate the 33 sector rankings within IBD's stock research tables for mid- to long-term performance. A strong sector helps a high-quality stock succeed in its breakouts.D.R. Horton (DHI) (breakout from a long saucer with handle at 34.64), Home Depot (HD) (saucer-with-handle breakout at 137.42), Nvidia (NVDA) and IPG Photonics (IPGP) are just some of the stocks from these four sectors that are showing unusual strength lately.Nvidia, the top chip-technology player in the video gaming markets, is No. 5 in the IBD 50 and has made big strides in the fields of deep learning, artificial intelligence, data center and self-driving cars. The big-cap tech is now extended after surging off its 10-week moving average near 140 three weeks ago. The stock is also up 35% after bolting out of a 13-week base in heavy turnover in the week ended May 12.Among top-performing new issues, Ichor (ICHR) worked on a fourth straight up day, rising nearly 3% to 22.27. While volume is running sharply below average, the semiconductor equipment firm hoisted itself back above the key 50-day moving average. A new base may be forming, with the correction in the base currently at 35% from head to toe.That 35% correction is typically the maximum amount of decline you'd like to see in a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base, two of the seven principal chart patterns that the biggest stock market winners produce before breaking out to new highs and unleashing strong price runs.Ichor broke the $100 million-revenue barrier on a quarterly basis during the third quarter of 2016, when sales jumped 40% to $105.7 million. Since then, revenue leapt 104% and 103% in the next two quarters while earnings made triple- to quadruple-digit increases.The Street sees Q2 profit exploding 329% higher to 60 cents a share, boosted in part by a 7% decline in the year-ago quarter.RELATED:How Much Will Q2 Earnings Rise For The Top Growth Firms?How To Learn Top Buy And Sell Rules For Growth InvestingThe Latest Names In Stock SpotlightSelling Stocks Like A Pro: What Is A True Cut Of The 50-Day Moving Average?

210,DHI,"Homebuilder KB Home (KBH) said it hopes to boost housing revenues over the next three years, but shares retreated amid a sharp drop in September housing starts.The company also forecast a 2017 average community count that is ""approximately flat relative to 2016.""KB Home stuck to its guidance for this year's fourth quarter.

211,DHI,"The Pending Home Sales Index fell for the third time in four months in August, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday, signaling weaker housing demand and tight supply.Pending-home sales fell 2.4% vs. a downwardly revised July to an index reading of 108.5. That's 0.2% below a year earlier.""An increased number of prospective buyers appear to be either wavering at the steeper home prices pushed up by inventory shortages or disheartened by the competition for the miniscule number of affordable listings,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun in a statement.The Pending Home Sales Index tracks contract signings for existing-home sales, foreshadowing actual existing-home closings in following month or two.On Monday, the Commerce Department said new-home sales fell 7.6% to an annual rate of 609,000, but that was much better than expected. Last week, existing-home sales and housing starts came in weaker than expected.IBD'S TAKE: There's an old saying that you should buy the worst house in a nice neighborhood.

221,DHI,"Existing-home sales have hit a nine-year high amid low interest rates and lower hiring, but mixed earnings reports Thursday from D.R. Horton (DHI), PulteGroup (PHM) and NVR (NVR) raise red flags.Existing-home sales rose 1.1% in June to an annualized rate of 5.57 million, the best since February 2007, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Existing-home prices rose 4.8% vs. a year earlier amid tight supply.But homebuilders' results were less positive. D.R. Horton, the nation's largest homebuilder by revenue, reported a 10% hike in second-quarter earnings per share minus one-time items to 66 cents, in line with forecasts. Revenue rose 13% to $3.23 billion, but that was lighter than the $3.26 billion Wall Street expected.The builder of single family and detached homes said its sales backlog was up 15% vs. Q2 2015, to 14,670 homes.D.R. Horton shares fell fractionally to 34.29 on the stock market today after briefly hitting a 10-year high. The stock is still slightly out of buy range from a 32.61 entry point cleared on July 6.IBD'S TAKE: D.R. Horton is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Builders-Residential/Commercial group. Which builder is No. 1? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup.PulteGroup reported Q2 net income of $118 million, or 37 cent EPS, up 32% vs. the same quarter a year ago. That beat estimates by 5 cents a share. Sales climbed 39% to $1.8 billion, topping views for $1.66 billion.Deliveries increased 27% to 4,772 homes, combined with an 11% increase in average selling price to $367,000. Value of backlog rose 21% to $3.7  billion, while the number of homes in backlog increased 8% to 9,679 homes. Chairman and CEO Richard Dugas said a written statement that, ""Equally important, given the 21% increase in our backlog value to $3.7 billion, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver outstanding full year performance.""PulteGroup also added three new directors to its board after reaching a deal with activist investor Elliott Management.PulteGroup stock has not been a leader among homebuilders. But shares rose 5.3% to 21.51 hitting a 11-month high and clearing a handle in a long, somewhat sloppy consolidation.NVR's Q2 EPS edged up fractionally to $22.01 a share, well below forecasts for $26.01 as sales dipped fractionally to $1.388 billion from $1.402 billion, missing Wall Street's $1.39 billion target. NVR stock fell sharply initially, but found support above its 200-day line and is now down just 0.7% at 1742.47, back above its 50-day. Shares broke out on July 8 to a record high, but quickly reversed in the following days.Among other homebuilders, shares of LGI Homes (LGIH), a builder of entry-level single-family homes in growth markets, jumped more than 4% to finish the trading day at 34.77 Thursday after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced late Wednesday that LGI Homes will replace doughnut chain Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (KKD) on the S&P 600 small-cap stock index next week. Krispy Kreme is being acquired by JAB Holdings.LGI Homes is extended from a recent breakout, and is closing in on its record high of 36.07 on Dec. 2, 2015.Separately, Sherwin-Williams (SHW) fell nearly 7% to 290.63, falling back below a 309.10 buy point after breaking on Wednesday. The paint seller and retailer reported Q2 EPS of $3.99 and revenue of $3.22 billion. Wall Street had expected Sherwin-Williams to deliver earnings of $4.16 on sales of $3.28 billion. Shares fell below their 50-day line.

222,DHI,"U.S. stock indexes coughed up small losses midday Tuesday, but several homebuilding stocks reached new highs.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both retreated 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average was off just 0.1%. Volume at midday was lower on the NYSE but higher on the Nasdaq compared with the previous session.Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) knifed 5% higher in volume that roared 700% above normal. The major player in the industry reported fiscal Q2 results that ended in May. The big cap surpassed the Street's expectations on revenue and earnings. EPS came in at 91 cents a share, almost 17% higher than expected. Revenue rolled to $3.26 billion, almost 13% above the consensus view. Orders, a sign of future activity, rose almost 12%.The stock cleared a shallow, base-on-base pattern as it scored a new high. The 53.89 buy point offers a buy range up to 56.58.Other homebuilders gathered courage, apparently from Lennar's strength. NVR (NVR) pegged a new high along with Toll Brothers (TOL) and KB Home (KBH). But each stock reversed off the early high. Volume was heavy for Toll and KB.D.R. Horton (DHI) tried to break out past a 34.64 buy point but couldn't hold above it. Still, the stock gained 1.6% in heavy volume.Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) inched above a 24.70 buy point, but then retreated under the entry. Volume was below average.Pulte Group (PHM) advanced 1% in fast trade. The midcap stock remains in the 5% buy zone from a 23.71 entry.The building-sector exchange traded funds — SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) — are up 15% and 24% so far this year.But IBD's homebuilder industry group is up 43% so far this year. Why the difference? IBD's industry group lists are price-weighted, and NVR, the biggest weighting in the homebuilder group, is up 48% for the year. The ETFs offer a more realistic picture.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the biggest percentage gainers of the day included biotechs, drugmakers, carmakers, generic drugs and homebuilders. On the downside, oil stocks were in the most painful positions.Biotech stocks are back in the top 40. On Tuesday midday, Biogen (BIIB) popped almost 3% higher in heavy volume, retaking its 50-day line. The former leader is 14% off its high. Celgene (CELG) advanced 1% in strong volume; the stock is near a 127.74 buy point.Semiconductor stocks, which rank No. 2 among 33 sectors, were mostly down but not decisively so. The chip stocks stumbled in the previous two weeks but are up 1% to 2% so far this week.RELATED:Would You Like A New High With That?

Amazon said it would pay $42 per share for the natural foods grocer, 27% above Thursday's closing price. The companies expect to close the deal in the second half of this year. Trading of Whole Food shares were halted until after the open.The jump in Amazon shares produced a buying opportunity, as the stock rebounded from its 10-week moving average in very heavy trade.Nike (NKE) dropped 3%, as JPMorgan cut its rating to neutral from overweight and trimmed its price target to 58, from 61.  Nike shares fell 3% in heavy trade Thursday after the company announced plans for a major realignment.Homebuilding stocks, one of the more durable industries amid the market's recent turbulence, came under some pressure early Friday as housing starts slowed 7% in May, to an annualized rate of 1.092 million, according to data released by the Commerce Department. Building permits also slowed, down 5% to a pace of 1.168 million. Economists had projected increases in both categories.D.R. Horton (DHI), Toll Brothers (TOL) and Pulte Group (PHM) opened 1% lower.Fiber-optic telecom gear maker Finisar (FNSR) spiked 10% in early trade. The company late Thursday reported fiscal fourth-quarter results in line with analyst expectations, but guided first-quarter earnings and revenue below consensus views. Analysts said the weakness was largely expected and already factored into Finisar's share price, and that demand for 3D sensing remained a positive for the company.The gain hoisted Finisar shares to a test of resistance at the stock's 40-week moving average, as they attempt to climb the right side of a three-month consolidation.Among IBD 50 stocks, fiber-optic telecom play Lumentum Holdings (LITE) notched a 1% at the open.

227,DHI,"The market fell Monday, but the major U.S. indexes had sharply pared their losses by the close.Today's ETF picks moved in opposite directions, yet both could offer fresh opportunities to buy shares soon. Keep in mind the market uptrend is under pressure, which means all purchases are riskier.SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) added 0.6% to extend its win streak to four and mark its highest close since August 2015. Shares cleared a 38.51 buy point of a flat base Tuesday, which formed adjacent to a prior flat base, and is still in buy range. Before that, the ETF advanced more than 8% from a December breakout.The fund, launched in January 2006, has attracted about $1.1 billion in assets. It tracks the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index, which is made up of housing-related stocks that trade on the major U.S. exchanges. Top 10 holdings in XHB as of June 9 included cabinet and plumbing products maker Masco (MAS), home improvement giant  (Home) (HD) and homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and Toll Bros. (TOL).XHB has outperformed the S&P 500 with a year-to-date gain of 13% vs. the benchmark index's 9% advance. Its average annual returns have outpaced the MSCI ACWI on a YTD, three-year and five-year basis, according to Morningstar Inc. But it's slightly lagged the index over a 10-year period at 2.7% vs. 3.9%.SPDR Technology (XLK) sank 2.5% Friday as chips and other techs sold off hard. On Monday, it gave up another 0.6%. But the day's action was bullish when you consider shares had fallen as much as 2.2% intraday. XLK found support at its 50-day moving average and reversed higher from there in heavy volume.Such a rebound off the 50-day or 10-week line can set up an opportunity to add shares, particularly if they continue to make a strong bounce. The December 1998-launched ETF ended Monday 2% above the 50-day line. A confirmed market uptrend would make for a more ideal environment for a rebound, however. It gapped higher Tuesday, rising 0.6%.The $17.1 billion fund, which tracks the S&P Information Technology Select Sector Index, owns Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) among its top 10 holdings. Apple lost 2.5% Monday, after tumbling 4% on Friday. The other three big techs trimmed their respective losses to less than 1% after initial deep dives.Let's check in with Monday's ETF picks to see how they fared. IShares Russell 2000 (IWM) edged fractionally lower Monday after climbing past a 141.92 flat-base entry intraday Friday. It's just shy of the buy point after inching up another 0.2% Tuesday.SPDR S&P MidCap 400 (MDY), which also rose above a buy point during Friday's session before closing below the entry, edged higher for a third straight day Monday. It's close to a 320.58 flat-base buy point.

229,DHI,"Stocks fell modestly in late morning trade Thursday, as a mixed bag of earnings moved individual stocks. A couple of homebuilding names took the spotlight while eBay (EBAY) vaulted to a record high.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.2%, the S&P 500 0.3%, and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.4%. Volume was mixed, with the NYSE tracking slightly lower than the same time Wednesday, while the Nasdaq's turnover was heavier in the stock market today.IBD 50 stocks were roughly evenly split between advancing and declining issues. The best performer was LGI Homes (LGIH), up 5% after the announcement it will join the small-cap S&P 600 after the close Wednesday. Mutual funds that track the index must buy the stock.In other news surrounding housing stocks, homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) initially hit a 10-year high after reporting in-line earnings of 66 cents a share, a 10% improvement from a year earlier. But sales were a little light. D.R. Horton shares are now down fractionally, still slightly extended from a 32.20 buy point.Meanwhile, fellow homebuilder NVR (NVR) and paint giant Sherwin-Williams (SHW) missed EPS and sales targets. NVR fell 1% while Sherwin-Williams tumbled 6%, undercutting a buy point after breaking out on Wednesday.June housing starts were stronger than expected, rising 4.8%, the Commerce Department said Wednesday but the homebuilder industry group has generally been a laggard, ranked No. 147 out of 197 groups. Existing-home sales rose to a 9-year high, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.Toy maker Mattel (MAT) rose less than 1%. It reported a 2-cent per-share loss, but that was better than expected. Mattel also announced it has been named master toy licensee for the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise, beginning in July 2017.Online marketplace operator eBay gapped up and was near the top of a consolidation with a 29.93 buy point. EBay was holding a 10.8% gain at 29.92 after rising to a record 30.03. EBay reported a cheery quarterly report late Wednesday.

230,DHI,"Homebuilders broke ground on an annualized 1.189 million units in June, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

Readings over 50 are positive.On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors will release its June existing-home sales report. Economists expect a modest fall to a 5.475 million annualized rate.Also Thursday, Wall Street should get quarterly earnings reports from D.R. Horton (DHI), Pulte Group (PHM) and NVR (NVR). All three have been breaking out, or trying to, in recent days.D.R. Horton recently cleared an early entry point at 32.20 as the stock soon moved out to a 10-year high. Pulte Group also recently cleared a 19.90 buy point in low volume, which is not encouraging. You could argue that Pulte is still in a long consolidation.NVR recently broke out on July 8, but the stock has since fallen for six straight sessions.IBD's TAKE: Building products stocks also are doing well. Continental Building Products (CBPX) on Monday broke out of a flat base with a 23.87 buy point, rising 4.1% to 24.35. Continental Building's volume was more than triple its average -- a sign of institutional buying. Installed Building Products (IBP) also hit a new high Monday.

235,DHI,"Toll Bros. (TOL) on Tuesday reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings early Tuesday, citing strong demand in ""affordable"" luxury homes. But shares of Toll Bros. and several other builders reversed to close lower, in part due to plunging new-home sales data.April U.S. new-home sales fell 11.4% to annual rate of 569,000 units, the Commerce Department reported at 10 a.m. ET, far less than the 602,000 expected. March sales were revised up substantially to a 10-year highs. Commerce figures last week showed a dip in housing starts and building permits for the month.Toll Bros.' results come as many homebuilder stocks remain in bases or buy zones, and as Wall Street looks for more insights into the state of the housing market.Estimates: Earnings per share of 63 cents, a 23.5% jump, on sales up 13.6% to $1.27 billion.Results: EPS up 43% to 72 cents with revenue up 22.2% to $1.36 billion.Toll delivered 1,638 units, up 22% in dollars and 26% in units, compared to FY 2016's second quarter. The average price of homes delivered was $832,400, compared to $855,500 one year ago as Toll makes more homes that are slightly less expensive.Net signed contracts rose to $2.02 billion and 2,511 units, up 23% in dollars and 26% in units.Outlook: Toll narrowed its fiscal-year delivery guidance to 6,950 and 7,450 homes vs. its old range of 6,700 to 7,500 units. The new midpoint is 7,200 homes, up from 7,100.""We believe we are benefiting from the appeal and national recognition of the Toll Brothers brand and a lack of large scale competition in the affordable end of the luxury new home market,"" said CEO Douglas Yearley in a statement.Stock: Shares hit 39.37 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today, but closed down 0.7% at 37.78. The stock is extended after breaking out of a flat base in February.Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) hit 53.32 soon after the open, briefly topping a 53.10 entry of a double-bottom base, but closed down 1.6% to 51.63. D.R. Horton (DHI) fell 1.6% to 33.37 after initially climbing to 34.39, near a 34.64 buy point from a saucer-with-handle base. Beazer Homes (BZH) is working on a cup base with a 15.90 buy point, but reversed from a 2% gain to a 2.5% slide at 14.28. Pulte Group (PHM) sank 1.55% to 22.93.Toll's earnings arrive as more millennials start to consider buying homes in a higher-priced housing market. The real estate company Redfin, in a December forecast, predicted that the housing market would keep growing this year, ""but at a slower pace due to affordability pressures.""""Sales would be stronger if there were more starter homes on the market to meet demand from millennial homebuyers,"" Redfin said. ""The lack of starter homes will keep sales growth weak next year.""But rising prices have helped home-improvement retailers like Home Depot (HD) and rival Lowe's (LOW), which reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Lowe's dipped to 84.05 on Monday, just below an 84.10 buy point. Lowe's edged up to 84.19 early but reversed for modest losses.Management for Home Depot, whose first-quarter results last week beat analyst forecasts, said on its earnings call that ""housing continues to be a growing asset class, and our sales thus far in May have been very good.""

But homebuilding companies continue to face labor shortages as the housing bust last decade sent skilled workers to other fields.In March, housing starts declined 6.8% to a annualized rate of 1.22 million units, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, as severe weather in the Midwest weighed on activity and followed an unseasonably warm February that inflated activity.

CEO Richard Dugas later announced his resignation, saying he planned to stay on in the position until next year.PulteGroup shares jumped 4.1% to 19.37 by the close in the stock market today.

262,DHI,"A slew of data out Thursday generally signaled that the U.S. economy once again is rebounding in the second quarter after an anemic start to the year. It also bolsters the case for Federal Reserve hawks to raise interest rates in June or July.Durable goods orders spiked 3.4% in April, the Commerce Department said Thursday, much better than forecasts, though business investment fell to a five-year low. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims fell more than expected, the Labor Department said. And pending home sales spiked 5.1% to a 10-year high.Economists had expected durable goods orders would show a rise of 0.3%, while March's gain was revised up 1.1 points to 1.9%. New orders for civilian aircraft from Boeing (BA) and others shot up 64.9%.Orders for big ticket, long-lasting goods excluding transportation rose 0.4%, matching views. But Commerce revised down ex transportation orders going back to 2014.Capital goods orders excluding aircraft and defense fell 0.8% in April. The core capital goods orders measure, a proxy for business investment plans, has fallen for the last three months and five of the last six. Along with downward revisions going back to 2014, the core capital goods orders level was the lowest since April 2011.A weaker dollar in April -- somewhat reversed in May amid higher Fed rate hike odds -- makes U.S. exports more competitive. Meanwhile, rising oil prices should stabilize capital spending in the energy sector.Separately, jobless claims fell 10,000 to 268,000 in the week ended May 21. Analysts had expected 275,000. Filings for jobless benefits are near historical lows, but had been creeping higher. The 4-week moving average rose by 2,750 to 278,500.The Pending Home Sales Index shot up 5.1% in April to the highest level since February 2006, the National Association of Realtors said.

266,DHI,"Sales of new homes hit a four-year high last month, and luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) said Tuesday the foundation for continued growth is in place, though questions remain about millennials' future buying habits.The Commerce Department said April new-home sales skyrocketed 16.6% to an annualized rate of 619,000, the highest since January 2008. Wall Street was looking for a small increase to 523,000 units.""We continue to believe the drivers are in place to sustain the current housing market's slow but steady growth,"" Toll Bros. Chairman Robert Toll said in a statement.""Interest rates remain low, the job picture continues to improve, home equity values are rising, supply remains constrained and the industry is still not building enough homes to meet the demand that current demographics imply are needed.""Toll Bros. shares closed up 8.7% in the stock market today, gapping above their 50-day average. Among other homebuilders, NVR (NVR) rose 3%. D.R. Horton (DHI) added 4.2%, Lennar (LEN) rose 3.9%, and PulteGroup (PHM) climbed 5.1%.Toll Bros., which sells to more affluent buyers, said adjusted fiscal second-quarter earnings climbed 39% to 51 cents a share, beating analyst estimates by 6 cents. Revenue grew 31% to $1.12 billion, well above analyst views for $1.04 billion.The homebuilder expects full-year revenue of $4.76 billion-$5.36 billion, with the midpoint of the range above views for $5.01 billion. Toll Bros. also expects to deliver 5,800-6,300 new homes for the year, with an average value of $820,000-$850,000.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the average home price climbed 6% to $379,800.Stifel Chief Economist Lindsey Piegza said the price increase may be too big for some consumers to swallow. ""If the price of new homes continues to go up, it will make it more difficult for the average potential homeowner to buy.""Piegza noted sales are still well below pre-recession highs. In April 2005, there were 1.26 million new homes sold, nearly double the figure this year, according to Commerce figures.Other analysts see strong results ahead.""Today's numbers were eye-popping growth,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. ""There is still plenty of momentum to go forward.""But new questions arose about whether millennials will buy homes at the same rate as earlier generations did. Piegza said they prefer to rent and may stay out of the home-buying market in the near term.And a new Pew Research Center study out Tuesday found that Americans 18 to 34 years old in 2014 were more likely to be live with their parents than in their own household with a spouse or partner. Pew said that is the first time that's happened in the modern era.But Robert Toll remained upbeat about the key demographic group, saying on a conference call that “as millennials mature, studies indicate their appetite for housing is consistent with past generations.”Meanwhile, paint and coatings company Valspar (VAL), which is being bought by Sherwin-Williams (SHW) for $11.3 billion, also said Tuesday that adjusted fiscal Q2 earnings rose 9.9% to $1.22 a share, 4 cents below forecasts. Revenue slid 2.1% to $1.056 billion, lighter than the expected $1.122 billion.

269,DHI,"Bears and bulls alike showed patience late Thursday afternoon as the stock indexes stayed close to the break-even level. The market is likely waiting for the second take on first quarter GDP, which will be released Friday before the opening bell.The Nasdaq inched up 0.3% Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average was fractionally lower. The Dow Jones utility average led the upside with a 0.9% pop. Volume was running lower on both major exchanges.GDP has been revised upward in each of the previous three quarters' second takes. In the first Q1 estimate, GDP came in at a weak 0.5%. The Street's consensus view expects the percentage to be adjusted upward to a still-sluggish 0.9%. The range of estimates ran from 0.5% to 1.1%.On Thursday, blue chips were mostly down. Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, only one attracted higher volume. Apple (AAPL) cranked up volume more than 40% above the usual pace, gaining 1.1% to 100.69. The stock is headed toward its fifth daily gain in a row and was testing its 100 price level. Apple has wiped out most of the losses tied to its April earnings report. The stock chart, though, still looks ugly.A report from Morgan Stanley says Apple is spending heavily on auto technologies' research and development. Apple’s R&D spending rose 30% in Q1 to $2.51 billion. This kind of investment could bring Apple back into the growth camp. Some market analysts say that Apple is now more of a conservative stock than a growth stock.How many failing red marks does Apple get in IBD Stock Checkup?Economic news was generally bullish Thursday. Durable goods orders in April bulldozed past the Street's estimate. April's increase was 3.4% vs. views for 0.3%. The March percentage was revised upward from 0.8% to 1.9%. Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims came in lower than expected.Pending home sales for April boomed 5.1% vs. views for 0.8%. The home sales number reached the highest level in 10 years. The reaction, however, among housing stocks was subdued. For example, D.R. Horton (DHI) was flat as the market headed into its final hour of trade.The one negative note came from the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing gauge. The needle pointed to minus 5 in May vs. minus 4 in April. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of GDP, has been a sore point in the U.S. economy.Breakouts Thursday included Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). Dollar General rose 5% intraday while Dollar Tree shot up 13.5%, both on earnings reports.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are now both above their 200-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish indicator for the health of the overall market. In another good sign, volume rose across the board compared to Monday, according to preliminary data.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) was up 9% in post-session trading after announcing that it will spin off its enterprise services unit and merge it with Computer Sciences (CSC), which soared 23% after hours.""The 'spin-merger' of HPE's Enterprise Services unit with CSC is the right next step for HPE and our customers,"" Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, said in a statement.

271,DHI,"The Nasdaq took a stab Tuesday at its best gain in more than two months as the stock market approached the day's last hour of trade.Blue chips lagged with a 1.2% gain for the Dow industrials, while the S&P 500 stepped up 1.3%. The Nasdaq and the small cap Russell 2000 led with pops of 1.9% and 2%, respectively. Volume was higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq, compared to the previous session.Technicals are improving in the stock market. The Nasdaq retook its 50-day and 200-day lines Tuesday. The S&P 500 also reclaimed its 50-day line (after climbing above the 200-day line in March). Recently, the Nasdaq's 50-day line crossed back above its 200-day line, which is a positive development.The Dow industrials were up almost without exception Tuesday afternoon, with 29 of the 30 stocks rising, including Visa (V), which added 2.8%, its biggest percentage gain since early March.

Smith (AOS) and financial data and analytics provider S&P Global (SPGI). S&P Global was formerly known as McGraw Hill Financial.New highs included designer of organic LED devices Universal Display (OLED), chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), software developer Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR) and chip designer MaxLinear (MXL).Economic reports released Tuesday offered grist for the bears and bulls alike.For the bears: The Richmond Federal Reserve's manufacturing index for May was weaker than expected. Wall Street had projected a reading of 8, but the figure came in at -1, a sign of contraction. In April, the reading was 14. Manufacturing weakness has been a concern in recent months. U.S. manufacturing accounts for about 12% of GDP.For the bulls: New-home sales in April trounced expectations. The Street's consensus estimate was 523,000, but the economy posted 619,000 -- a stunning 18% beat and the highest level in more than eight years. The figure easily topped the entire range of estimates, which ran from a low of 510,000 to a high of 530,000.Homebuilder stocks rose in response, with gains mostly in the 3% to 5% range, but many of the stocks remain far off their highs. Toll Brothers (TOL) jumped more than 8% Tuesday on a strong quarterly report, but the stock was still about 30% below its August peak.Two homebuilder stocks have better-looking charts than most in their group. D.R. Horton (DHI) is 8% off its high, and NVR (NVR) is only 5% off its high.

Find out at IBD Stock CheckupWoodlands, Texas-based LGI Homes said April home closings soared 27.7% to 341 homes, up from 267 in the same month a year earlier. The entry-level and single-family homebuilder ended the first four months of 2016 with 1,185 home closings, a 26.3% jump from the same period in 2015.The homebuilder is also in the IBD Sector Leaders group, and its stock is working on a 3-1/2-month cup-with-handle base with a 29.87 buy point. It rose as much as 3% intraday before closing up 1.6% at 27.98 on the stock market today.LGI is due to report first-quarter results next Tuesday. Analysts' consensus is for earnings per share minus one-time items to jump 58% to 52 cents on a 39% hike in revenue to $167.6 million. The company is growing rapidly beyond its Lone Star state home base, and investors will key in on Q2 prospects as it expands into Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and other states.Meanwhile, Installed Building Products, which installs garage doors, rain gutters, shower doors and the like for homebuilders, reported Q1 earnings early Thursday that crushed estimates.Installed Building Products earned 19 cents a share -- 21 cents excluding various items -- vs. 5 cents in the same quarter last year.

Also curious was the fact that only a few stocks were up in heavy volume.Homebuilders continued to provide some interesting charts. D.R. Horton (DHI) was trying to break out past the 34.15 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. But both the price and volume activity was insufficient to view today's move as a rush of institutional buying. The relative strength line is not near a new high, which is another damper on the potential entry.Homebuilders have shot up to the top 10 of IBD's 197 industry rankings from below 50 six weeks ago.

282,DHI,"New-home sales rose to an annual rate of 512,000 last month the Commerce Department said Wednesday, signaling a steady if unspectacular pace for housing activity.Economists had expected 510,000 in February. January sales were revised up to 502,000 from 494,000, but are still down 6.1% vs. a year earlier.The median sales price in February was $301,400, up 2.6% vs. a year earlier after declining in the prior two months. The number of homes for sale was the highest since October 2009, while homes underway hit the highest since the end of 2008.That suggests homebuilders are growing a little less cautious about ramping up construction. They've also had trouble finding qualified workers and securing attractive lots. KB Home (KBH) reports quarterly earnings after the market close.KB Home shares fell 1.8% near midday on the stock market today. Lennar (LEN) sank 0.6% and D.R. Horton (DHI) 0.8%. LGI Homes (LGIH) lost 2.1% and Pulte Group (PHM) 1%.Regionally, new-home sales surged 35.8% after tumbling 32.7% in January. Sales fell in the other three regions last month.

He's not so sure and wants to wait until it's clear that inflation is trending higher.Industrial production rebounded much more strongly than expected in January, the Federal Reserve reported, a positive sign about activity at the nation's factories, utilities and mines. Factory activity was led auto production as General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) and others continue to report strong sales.This afternoon, the Fed will release minutes from its January policy meeting, to offer more insight into how worried policymakers were about financial market turmoil and sluggish economic data.Single-family home construction starts fell 3.9% in January to an annualized 731,000, still up 3.5% from a year ago. Multi-family starts fell 2.5% on the month and were down 3.8% on the year.Home builder sentiment slipped to a nine-month low, but they still remain pretty upbeat despite lower customer traffic, the National Association of Home Builders reported on Tuesday.Home builders such as D.R. Horton (DHI) are targeting first-time homebuyers, who account for more than 40% of recent sales.Building permits were up 13.5% from a year ago in January. Single-family permits slipped 1.6% in January, but were still 9.6% above year-ago levels.While starts are down, housing completions climbed to an annualized 1.057 million, the most since November 2008.

Refinancing activity shot up 16% after the prior week's 15.8% as mortgage rates fell for a sixth straight week.

Rosengren called for a ""unhurried . . . more gradual approach"" to normalizing rates in response to slow exports and financial market volatility. Alluding to the junk bond market, he noted firms are already facing higher borrowing costs. Rosengren is a voting Fed policymaker this year.Industrial production rose a stronger-than-expected 0.9% in January, the Federal Reserve said. The gain was led by a 5.4% jump in utilities output, thanks to a shift from unseasonably warm weather, after three months of declines. But manufacturing output unexpectedly rose 0.5% after falling the two prior months.Mining output -- including oil drilling -- was flat last month and down 9.8% vs. a year earlier.However, overall and manufacturing figures were revised to show slightly bigger declines in both November and December.The factory output increase was split between nondurables, such as food, and durables. While production of electrical equipment and appliances fell, that was more than offset by a boost in auto production.The vehicle production gain came amid a better-than-expected month for U.S. auto sales, led by General Motors, Ford and other automakers. GM and Ford shares rose about 1% soon after the opening bell on the stock market today, but have been weak amid troubles in various regions overseas and concerns that U.S. auto sales have peaked.Capacity utilization rose to 77.1% from 76.4%. Factory capacity utilization rose to 76.1% from 75.8%, but is still even with where it was a year ago.Several other reports, including the Institute for Supply Management, showed manufacturing retreating in January.

Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views.

Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast.

Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well. 
"
305,DHI,"Homebuilder stocks sold off Tuesday after the Trump administration imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber imports, a move that could raise housing prices signficantly. Meanwhile, Pulte Group (PHM) reported first-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst estimates, the second builder to deliver disappointing results in less than a week.The U.S. government slapped a retroactive penalty on Canadian softwood late Monday. The tariff could raise the cost of a home by $1,236, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Just the prospect of a tariff had helped push up lumber prices sharply after the a prior U.S.-Canada deal expired at the end of last year.Before Tuesday's market open, Pulte Group earned 31 cents a share excluding various items, up 29% vs. a year earlier. Analysts had expected EPS of 29 cents. Revenue climbed 14% to $1.629 billion, below Wall Street targets of $1.7538 billion.Net orders rose 8% by units and 16% by dollar value.Pulte shares slid 3.8% to 22.20 in the stock market today, falling below its 50-day moving average. The stock is technically above a 22.08 buy point after falling as low as 21.41, but it's the fourth straight loss in above-average volume. Pulte cleared that entry in late February, as builders rallied on tight housing supply and labor markets, with mortgage rates pulling back from postelection peaks.Pulte's recent retreat began when D.R. Horton (DHI) reported quarterly results on April 20. D.R. Horton's earnings were strong, but there were some concerns about guidance and order cancellations. D.R. Horton initially retook a buy point that day but soon reversed lower, dragging down Pulte and other builders. D.R. Horton sank 1.2%, undercutting its 50-day line but closing near session highs.Lennar (LEN) tumbled 1.7%, testing its 50-day moving average. The stock has been forming a flat base after breaking out in late February from a prior consolidation.Meanwhile, investors got  a pair of relatively upbeat economic reports on housing Tuesday.The S&P/Case-Schiller home price index rose 0.7% in February vs. January, seasonally adjusted, below views for a 0.8% gain. But the 5.9% yearly rise just topped views.New-home sales jumped 5.8% in March to an annual rate of 621,000, the highest since July, the Commerce Department said. That was much better than views for a slight dip to an annualized 584,000.Separately, the Consumer Confidence Index fell to 120.3 in April from a downwardly revised 124.9 in March. Economists had expected 123.1. The consumer gauge remains high, but off postelection peaks.RELATED:D.R. Horton Reverses From Buy Point Despite Strong Earnings, Guidance

Helped by solid earnings, Biogen gapped above its 50-day moving average as it approaches an early entry at 298.10. Celgene is closing in on a 127.74 buy point.Inside the IBD 50, China-based New Oriental Education (EDU) was a top performer, up 6%, after reporting strong earnings Monday. Wall Street liked the look of a big earnings beat and the second straight quarter of accelerating sales growth.Autohome (ATHM), also based in China, rose nearly 4%. It's back above the 50-day moving average as it works on a new base with a 36.11 buy point.Homebuilders had another rough go of it after lagging Monday's market gains. Shares of PulteGroup (PHM) gapped below the 50-day moving average, falling 4%. Among other things, Wall Street didn't like news that sales growth decelerated for the third straight quarter. Group peer D.R. Horton (DHI) is below its 50-day moving average after falling hard last week on earnings.Defense firm Lockheed Martin (LMT) paid a visit to its 50-day moving average as shares slumped nearly 3%.

307,DHI,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite signaled modest gains early Tuesday as the major market averages look set to hold and extend Monday's big gains.Dow components McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) report earnings before the open, along with Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Pulte Group (PHM). All are in buy range as of Monday's close except for Caterpillar, which took a big step Monday toward its own entry point.Meanwhile, look for Express Scripts (ESRX) to sell off at Tuesday's open on bad news. Express Scripts announced that it was likely to lose its top customer, Anthem (ANTM), sending shares of the pharmacy benefit manager down 15% late Monday. (CVS Health (CVS), which is a major PBM in addition to its drugstore operations, was up 3% late, perhaps on hopes that it will win the Anthem business.)On Monday, the Nasdaq composite soared 1.2%, hitting an all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 index rose 1.1%, both retaking their 50-day moving averages.

Analysts expect a 6% sales decline, to $5.53 billion, with earnings per share up 8%, to $1.33. U.S. same-store sales will be watched closely.Beyond Q1 results and guidance, analysts will look for McDonald's clues about when it will roll out its mobile order-and-pay system, as well as any further talk of deliveries. Investors also will want to know how McDonald's big McCafe promotions are working, which could impact Starbucks (SBUX). Starbucks has broken out of its own consolidation ahead of earnings on Thursday.Analysts expect the maker of heavy construction and mining equipment to report a 7.5% EPS decline, to 62 cents, with sales off 2%, to $9.27 billion.

310,DHI,"Department store chain J.C. Penney (JCP), soaring since its Feb. 25 report of an 875% earnings per share gain in the fourth quarter of 2015, helped make the $189 million Hodges Retail Fund (HDPMX) the top-performing U.S. diversified stock mutual fund with at least $100 million in assets in the week that ended March 3.The fund gained 11.93% in the week, according to Lipper Inc. It trounced the average gain of 2.86% for U.S. diversified stock mutual funds.The S&P 500 advanced 2.19% in the week. The broad market's strength stemmed from positive stock market news about oil price gains and upbeat economic data.Penney's Q4 earnings per share of 39 cents clobbered analysts' consensus estimates of 23 cents.Revenue of $4 billion also topped expectations of $3.99 billion. The sales gain was due to hearty holiday sales, and it was higher than the $3.9 billion that Penney reported a year earlier.The gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was their third straight weekly advance and their fifth in the past six weeks.Craig Hodges and Eric Marshall run the Hodges Fund.The fund's 10.62% average annual gain over the past three years ranked it in the top 20% of its large-cap blend peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.As of Dec. 31, the fund had 97% of its money at work in U.S. stocks. Almost all of the balance was invested in foreign stocks, with just a fraction in cash.The fund had a 32% allocation to small-cap stocks, 35% in micro caps and 15% in midcaps. The rest of the fund was in large and giant caps.The fund's biggest sector weighting was in consumer cyclicals, which accounted for 25% of the fund's stocks. Industrials had a 21% weighting. Basic materials had a 16%.Energy and technology were the next two largest, with 12% and 11% respectively.Penney was the third-largest holding. Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL), Trinity Industries (TRN), Eagle Materials (EXP) and Matador Resources (MTDR) rounded out the top five.Penney is the fund's top-performing stock so far this year, according to Morningstar. It's up 63% year to date.The fund also has seven stocks with a Composite Rating from IBD of 80 or higher.The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Social media giant Facebook (FB), with a 99 Comp Rating, rose 1.4% in the week.Texas Pacific Land Trust, with a 90 Comp Rating, rose nearly 8% in the week.

311,DHI,"A cart-full of good news on Tuesday -- especially for Home Depot (HD) -- showed that the housing sector continued to be one of the strongest parts of the economy to start 2016.Existing-home sales solidly beat expectations in January, more people are finally putting their homes up for sale to cash in on healthy price gains, and Home Depot saw same-store sales surge by 8.9% in the quarter ended Jan. 31.Existing-home sales rose to a 5.47 million annual pace, just shy of July's level that was the highest since early 2007, the National Association of Realtors said.Sales rose 0.4% from the prior month, but the gain was a surprise because December's total had been artificially goosed by new disclosure requirements that took effect in November, delaying many closings. Compared to the year-earlier period, existing-home sales were up 11% in January, the biggest annual gain since July 2013.The 1.82 million existing homes available for sale rose 3.4% on the month but were still down 2.2% from a year earlier. That means there’s just a 4.0-month supply of homes for sale, just above December's 3.9 months, which was the lowest since January 2005.Amid tight supplies, buyers bid up the national median home price by 8.2% from a year earlier, the largest gain since April.""Spring buying season is right around the corner, and current supply levels aren't even close to what's needed"" to meet housing demand, NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.The shortage of existing homes for sale is good news for home builders. On Tuesday, luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers (TOL) told analysts it now expects its average selling price will range from $810,000 to $850,000 this year, a $10,000 boost on the low end.With the pace of home sales on the rise, and more people getting their homes ready to sell, business is in great shape for Home Depot. Sales rose 9.5%, the best gain in 10 quarters, as big-ticket sales led the way, with transactions over $900 jumping 12%. Home Depot shares rose 1.4% to 124.53 on the stock market today, closing just below their 50-day line after rising as high as 127.19.Rival Lowe's (LOW) is set to report earnings early Wednesday. Lowe's stock closed down 2.3%.The strong housing sector is helping the economy withstand a case of the jitters brought on by the financial market rout that began the year. Home builders such as Toll Brothers and D.R. Horton (DHI) have a big order backlog to keep them busy in the near term.Toll CEO Douglas Yearly noted that home buyer traffic was up 13% in the first three weeks of February. Still, he said that contracts signed this month ""were basically flat compared to the prior year,"" something he attributed to the recent stock market decline.But despite weaker-than-expected earnings, investors were satisfied with the outlook for Toll Bros. and sent its shares up 3.8% on a bad market day.The pause in new-order momentum for the luxury home builder coincided with an overall drop in U.S. consumer confidence. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its confidence index fell to 92.2 in February, down 5.6 points to the lowest level since July. The expectations index slipped to its lowest point in two years, as the share of people expecting an income boost declined to 17.2% from 18.6%. Meanwhile, those who expect their incomes to drop rose to 12.5% from 10.7%.One concern about the housing market is that income gains are running far below the pace of home price increases, which is a negative for demand.December housing market data from S&P/Case-Shiller showed that national home prices rose 5.4% from a year earlier, up from 5.2% in November. But there's tentative evidence that price gains in major cities have stopped accelerating. The 20-city  index showed year-over-year price gains holding at 5.7%, while gains in Case-Shiller's 10-city index slowed to 5.1% from 5.2%.

It's the sixth consecutive quarter of EPS growth for D.R. Horton, though earnings growth decelerated for the second straight quarter. Revenue rose 4.5% to $2.3 billion, missing estimates of $2.4 billion. It was the 18th straight quarter of revenue growth, but the weakest of those quarters.Homes closed rose 1% to 8,061 for the three-month period ended Dec. 31, compared to 7,973 homes a year earlier. Backlog rose 15% to 10,665 homes with a total value of $3.2 billion, up 16%. The company's cancellation rate fell one percentage point to 23%.Southeast region home sales rose 13.1% to 2,691, but fell everywhere else.Horton didn't give guidance in its earnings report, but Donald R. Horton, the company's chairman, said in a conference call that the company expects full-year revenue in a range between $12 billion and $12.5 billion.Shares closed down 4.7% on the stock market today. D.R. Horton has traded below its 200-day moving average since Jan. 7. Its current IBD Composite Rating is 94 out of 99, meaning it trades better than 94% of other publicly traded businesses.Other homebuilders' shares fell as markets turned lower Monday.

Demand for refinancing fell 2.3% last week, following losses of 7% or more in each of the prior two weeks, but they remained 13% higher than a year earlier.The average interest rate for 30-year conforming loans ($417,000 or less) climbed six basis points to 3.89%.Since the Federal Reserve raised its target federal funds rate in December, additional interest rate hikes in the short term are no longer considered likely. Central banks in Sweden and Japan have got into negative rate territory -- as has the European Central Bank, which is expected to cut its negative rate further on Thursday.Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC), a major mortgage lender, fell 0.5% on the stock market today. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) climbed 0.6%. Wells Fargo and and JPMorgan rose above their 50-day moving averages intraday, but Wells fell back below that level. Bank of America is tracking slightly below that downward-sloping line. All three are still down sharply in 2016 and well of their July peaks.As for homebuilders, D.R. Horton (DHI) rose 1.3%, and LGI Homes (LGIH) shot up 9.7%.D.R. Horton found resistance at its 200-day line late last week and is trying to stay above its 50-day average.LGI Homes on Wednesday reported that quarterly earnings more than doubled, topping views.

Meanwhile, homebuilders are less confident, as housing activity expands but not at a powerful pace.The New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing index improved less than expected from January's worst reading since the Great Recession.Overall business conditions edged up from -19.6 to -16.6 in February, still the second worst since 2009. The six-month outlook also perked up, from 9.51 to 14.48, but January was the worst reading since 2011.New orders and shipments improved, but remained firmly in negative territory, signaling contraction. Employment was barely negative at -0.99, after falling sharply the prior month, but the average workweek continued to get shorter at -5.94.The good news for manufacturers is that the strong dollar has given up ground as markets price out further Federal Reserve rate hikes this year. General Electric (GE) stock rose 1.4% in morning trade on the stock market today, while Caterpillar (CAT) advanced 1.6%.Homebuilders were slightly less upbeat this month, but still feel very positive about the outlook for new home sales.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo housing market index slipped to 58, down from 61 in January and the lowest since May.Despite lower mortgage rates, the gauge of prospective home buyer traffic fell to a nine-month low of 39. The reading of current sales eased to a still-strong 65 from 68. A measure of builder sentiment about the six-month outlook for sales edged up one point to 65.Readings above 50 show that more builders view conditions as good than the share who see conditions as poor.D.R.

319,DHI,"The major indexes shifted back into positive gear in early-afternoon trade Tuesday on the back of ongoing concern about uneven economic activity overseas, as voiced by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen during a speech at the Economic Club of New York. The Nasdaq pushed into its highest levels of the day.A day after the major indexes traded quietly, the tech-rich Nasdaq composite jumped more than 1% higher, on track for its biggest single-session gain since a nearly 0.8% lift March 16. The stock market has surprised the bears with a fairly sturdy uptrend that was confirmed by a Day 4 follow-through on Feb. 17. Yet it's been mostly piecemeal gains by high-growth stocks and slow-yet-steady moves up by defensive names.The S&P 500 gained nearly 0.7%, a pleasant reversal given that the large-cap benchmark was down nearly 0.5% in the early going. Small caps are outrunning the field, with the S&P 600 up 1.8% and the Russell 2000 up 1.5%. Volume tracked sharply higher on both exchanges.Homebuilders are rallying in the stock market today following a robust 5.8% gain in the Case-Shiller survey of January prices in its 20-city index.The industry group had a slippery start to the new year. Former Leaderboard member D.R. Horton (DHI) caved by 28% in the first six weeks of 2016, obliterating all its gains from a prior October breakout past a 28.80 entry. Yet since then, the top-tier homebuilder has carved out a new cup with handle that features a 30.68 buy point. On Tuesday, Horton surpassed the proper entry, but volume is running slightly below average. Horton's 50-day average volume is just under 6 million shares. The cup's handle passes the midpoint test (29.83 for the handle vs. 28.04 for the base).Virginia-based luxury homebuilder NVR Inc. (NVR) has been the group's leader. The stock, up 2% in heavy volume, is now up 7% past a 1665.10 early entry within a three-month consolidation. Horton and NVR are both rising, also because of better-than-expected fiscal Q1 results by Miami-based giant Lennar (LEN), up nearly 2% in big turnover. Lennar is trying to reclaim its 200-day moving average, an area of upside resistance. Lennar is 15% below a 56.04 52-week high, meaning that it, too, is coming within the typical range in which a high-quality growth stock can set up a successful breakout.Lennar posted a 26% rise in profit for the quarter ended in February, walloping the Street's consensus view by 21%. Revenue rose 21% to $1.99 billion, showing accelerating growth vs. the 14% gain seen in the November-ended fiscal fourth quarter. After-tax margin improved to 7.2% vs. 7.0% a year ago.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group is still not among the top 40 groups within the 197 rankings, yet has climbed to 76th vs. 118th three weeks ago.

The forward-looking gauge is based on existing-home contract signings that should translate into actual closed sales in a month or two. The index rose just 2.7% vs. November 2014, the smallest yearly gain since October 2014. Modest monthly gains in the Midwest and South were offset by larger declines in the Northeast and West.The report gives homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and LGI Homes (LGIH) reasons to step up activity, but also to be cautious. And that's what they've been doing. D.R.

377,DHI,"U.S. home prices rose 5.2% in October vs. a year earlier amid tight supply, according to the latest S&P/Case-Schiller data, which should be good news for homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and LGI Homes (LGIH).It was the fourth straight month of acceleration and the best gain since July 2014. Homes appreciated 5.5% in 20 key cities, with 12 metro areas showing faster rises. Portland, San Francisco and Denver led with 10.9% advances.Economic conditions support housing demand, but limited inventory is what's fueling higher prices. Homebuilders have been cautious about building, with D.R. Horton among those also citing labor shortages. But single-family housing starts rose to an eight-year high in November, the Commerce Department reported this month. That should eventually bolster supply of new homes and help boost affordability for first-time buyers.D.R. Horton stock rose 1% to 32.61 on the stock market today, close to a Dec. 2 nine-year high of 32.10. Lennar climbed 0.9% while LGI Homes shot up 4.1%.
"
378,DHI,"The economy rose at a 2% annual rate in the third quarter, revised down from 2.1% and Q2's 3.9%, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The U.S. is on pace for a 10th straight year of failing to achieve 3% annual growth. That helps explain why it took nearly a decade for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, and why Donald Trump has had so much support in his presidential run.
"
379,DHI,"In the third quarter, exports were a little weaker than previously estimated, as U.S. manufacturers and others struggle to sell to weak overseas economies amid a strong dollar. Inventories rose a little less than expected, subtracting 0.7 percentage point from Q3 GDP growth. Most economists expect business destockpiling still has a ways to go.
"
380,DHI,"Business investment rose at a 9.9% pace, the best in a year. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of economic activity, rose at a solid 3% pace amid improving jobs and wages and cheap gas prices at the pump.
"
381,DHI,"But through the first nine months of 2015, GDP has risen at a 2.2% rate. Most economists see Q4 growth as lackluster, leaving the economy with less than 3% yet again. This decade of futility would the worst in the post-World War II era.
"
382,DHI,"Sluggish growth has left wages stagnant for Americans, especially noncollege educated men. This blue collar discontent has generated resentment and forms the base of Trump's populist presidential run. More than two-thirds (69%) of Trump supporters say the U.S. is still in a recession, according to the latest IBD/TIPP Poll, even though the current expansion started in June 2009; 44% of Trump supporters are in job-sensitive households, meaning they or someone in their family are looking for work or worried about losing their job.
"
383,DHI,"The decade of weak economic growth — including the sharpest recession since the Depression and the weakest expansion since WWII — also lines up with the Fed's reluctance to raise rates. Until this month's move, the Fed hadn't hiked since mid-2006, and for nearly 7 years the rate had been near zero.

384,DHI,"Job growth has been sluggish and wages too. Yes, unemployment has fallen to 5%, but much of that reflects a sharp decline in the labor force participation rate.

New mortgage disclosure rules appeared to delay existing-home closings, perhaps pushing some closings into November.
"
389,DHI,"NAR also once again blamed a lack of supply for the weak housing sales figures. The number of existing homes for sales fell 3.3% to 2.04 million — down 1.9% vs. a year earlier. Tight supply and rising home prices should spur more activity from D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and other homebuilders.

506,DHI,"After losing ground on Monday, shares of No. 1 homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) roared back to life Tuesday after it reported better-than-expected sales and earnings for its September-ending fourth quarter as the number of finished homes climbed 23% and new orders rose 19%, led by strong growth in the Southeast.Shares closed up 8.3% in the stock market today. They had dipped more than 2% Monday along with a broad falloff in homebuilder stocks as investors weighed the increased possibility of a Fed rate hike in December. Other homebuilders also sprung back on Tuesday.The Fort Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton earned 64 cents a share in the quarter, two cents above views and up from last year's 45 cents. Homebuilding revenue of $3.05 billion was 28% higher than a year earlier.Smaller homebuilder Beazer Homes (BZH), which also reported results for its September-ending quarter early Tuesday, didn't fare as well early in the trading day after it reported mixed results, including a 12% gain in home closings vs. a year earlier but a slight drop in orders and homebuilding gross margin. But it ended the day up 5.6%.Of Beazer's $354.5 million in net income from continuing operations, nearly $324 million came from a tax benefit. The company said that it expects ""significant"" growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2016 and beyond, however.While D.R. Horton's net sales orders — a future-looking barometer — increased 19% to 8,477 homes, the value of those homes rose 22% to $2.5 billion. The biggest gains were in the Southeast, where the number of communities had grown sharply over the last couple of years.Orders in the Southeast jumped 40% to 2,868 homes. Orders in the South Central region, which includes the firm's home state of Texas, rose nearly 8% to 2,367 homes, but their value increased 19%.Horton's average selling prices in the quarter were up only 3.4% as sales of lower-priced, entry-level Express Homes increased. With an average price of $191,000, they accounted for more than 20% of homes sold and 14% of home-sales revenue, the majority of sales coming from Texas, Florida and the Carolinas, said a company spokeswoman.In a conference call, executives said that they expect Express Homes and the firm's high-end Emerald Homes division to continue expanding, with Express Homes seen rising to around 20% of home-sales revenue by the end of fiscal 2016 and Emerald Homes in the high single digits.At the end of September, Horton had a sales order backlog of 10,662 homes, up 10% in value from a year earlier and a ""well-stocked supply of land and lots,"" Chief Executive David Auld said in a morning conference call. That, he added, gives it a ""strong competitive advantage.""Horton raised its quarterly dividend 28% to 8 cents a share, payable on Dec. 14.Lennar (LEN), the second largest homebuilder, was up 3.35% at the close Tuesday. PulteGroup (PHM) gained 3.6%. Toll Bros. (TOL) advanced 2%. It fell 1.2% Monday even though it reported a fairly decent October-ending quarter that day.Follow Marilyn Alva on Twitter @IBD_MAlva.

558,DHI,"Mortgage applications surge The Mortgage Bankers Association's weekly composite index leapt 11.8% in the Oct. 16 week. Refinancings were up 8.8%, thanks also to a 4 basis point decline to an average of 3.95%, the lowest since May. Purchase applications were up 16.4% after plunging 34.1% in the prior week. Mortgage applications, especially for buying a home, have been volatile…
"
559,DHI,"Investors dumped stocks in late-afternoon trading Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, as widely expected. The Dow industrials were holding up the best among the key benchmarks, losing less than 0.1% at around 2:45 p.m. ET, after marking a new all-time high of 21,354 earlier in the day.But the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was off 0.3%, disguising decent gains from grain, non-alcoholic beverage, homebuilding, automaker, packaged food, meat and tobacco stocks.Weak U.S. economic data on retail sales and consumer prices sent long U.S. government bonds soaring, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note falling to as low as 2.10%. That low takes the yield on the 10-year bond back to levels right after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.While the fed funds rate is like to go up a quarter point to a target range of 1%-1.25%, banking stocks are falling amid poor data on U.S. retail sales (down 0.3% in May, vs. the Econoday consensus view for a 0.1% rise). However, damage is relatively limited among the top financial plays so far.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) dropped as much as 1.5% before shaving losses to around 0.7% at 86.66, but volume at 2:30 p.m. ET was running well below usual levels.Among the groups leading the upside, IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group is a market leader, ranked No. 6 among 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance.The group has at least eight companies boasting a Composite Rating of 95 or higher, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. They include NVR (NVR), Taylor Morrison (TMHC), MDC Holdings (MDC), Pulte Group (PHM), MI Homes (MHO) and Toll Bros. (TOL).NVR added 0.4% to 2,443 in dull volume. The luxury homebuilder in the East Coast ran past a 1,845.47 saucer-type base entry after reporting an 18% rise in fourth-quarter earnings per share on Jan. 25. For now, shares are extended. Taylor Morrison, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., is extended from a first-stage big cup with handle at 18.46. Shares are up more than 3% for the week at 24.49.Industry peer D.R. Horton (DHI) is not in this elite group, yet its 92 Composite Rating is still respectable. The Fort Worth, Texas, maker of single-family homes rose 2% to 34.63, poking briefly above a 34.64 entry in a long cup with handle.Horton has done a solid job of posting steady and solid gains on both the top and bottom lines.Earnings have nearly quadrupled over the past four years, from 67 cents a share in fiscal 2012 (ended in September that year) to $2.36 a share in FY 2016. Sales have jumped from $4.35 billion to $12.16 billion over the same time frame.However, the Street is expecting slower growth in the future, and that may have something to do with the stock's recent failed attempts to make much of a gain after a solid breakout. The stock, as seen in a daily chart, tried to clear a 34.15 handle buy point on April 17-18, but notice how volume was less than stellar. The stock sold off hard the next several sessions, but Horton has done a good job of not falling too far below its critical 50-day moving average.IBD's TAKE: Home Depot is not the only consumer spending stock that is excelling this year. Go to IBD Big Cap 20 to find at least six names that are benefiting from strong demand in the medical, leisure and building-related industries.Pulte bucked the decline with a 0.6% rise to 24.28 and volume was heavy. The stock briefly advanced past a 24.53 buy point in a new seven-week flat base. The 12% decline within the base falls within normal range for a flat base, one of the most bullish patterns that great stocks form en route to excellent breakouts and fantastic price gains.Despite some questionable action by the builders on Wednesday, the prospect of a continued slow rise in the cost of money should be a tail wind for these builders and related stocks, since low interest rates encourage home buying. Home Depot (HD) gained more than 1% to 156.42 in fast turnover, triggering a new follow-on entry point as it finds nice buying support at the 50-day moving average. It's the second test of the 50-day line since the DIY building products retailer cleared a 137.42 cup-with-handle buy point in January.The Dow 30 component and mega-cap retailer has a decent but not great Composite Rating of 82 on a scale of 1 to 99. But that masks reasonable EPS growth targets of 12% and 13% in the next two full fiscal years.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Apple (AAPL) surrendered minor early gains and fell nearly 1% to 145.21, but the tech leader is still trading just 2% below its rising 50-day moving average. As noted in prior Stock Market Today columns earlier this week, the iPhone maker is in the midst of a general turnaround in both earnings and revenue growth. The stock had broken out of a proper cup-with-handle base on Jan. 6-9, moving smoothly past a 118.12 entry, 10 cents above the handle's high. Apple has since rallied more than 30%.Five Below (FIVE) sank as much as 6% to a session low of 48, undercutting its 50-day moving average for the first time since March. The stock is trying to rebound off that low but is still down 5%. Volume is running more than double normal levels. A future rebound and close near or above the 50-day line, currently around 49.59, would mark a bullish shakeout.RELATED:In Stock Market Today: Is Apple Flashing A New Buy Signal?Top Growth Stocks Today: Check The Latest IBD 50Strong Large-Cap Names: What's In The Current IBD Big Cap 20?

563,DHI,"Some housing experts suggest that millennials may never participate to the same degree as their predecessors in the American dream of homeownership, or at least not anytime soon.
"
564,DHI,"About a fifth of the more than 80 million-strong cohort, a demographic usually described as ranging in age from the late teens or early 20s to the mid-30s, still live with their parents or other older relatives.
"
565,DHI,"About 50% are renters. Large numbers are considered underemployed and underpaid, and they have delayed the usual triggers for buying a home: marriage and kids.
"
566,DHI,"In July, first-time buyers accounted for just 28% of existing home sales, down from an already low 30% in June, according to the National Association of Realtors.
"
567,DHI,"In rosier times before the housing crisis, the historic average was a little less than 40% of the total, says Selma Hepp, chief economist with Trulia, a home-information website that is part of Zillow Group (Z). Their numbers spiked briefly in 2009, to nearly 39% of home sales. But that was due to a one-time tax credit for first-timers.
"
568,DHI,"Other evidence paints a more positive picture: Most millennials say they want to eventually buy a home if they don't already own one now. The big question: when?
"
569,DHI,"A survey by Trulia indicated that nine out of 10 millennials plan to buy a home, ""but not necessarily today,"" said Hepp.
"
570,DHI,"In the survey, 50% of those married with kids said they plan to buy sooner than later — within the next two years. ""The ones that have gotten married and have kids are trickling in now,"" Hepp said.
"
571,DHI,"""Our data and numerous data indicate they are coming back into the market and contributing a bigger share to the new-buyer market,"" she said. ""The thing is, in many markets where they would be buying, they may be constrained by affordability.""
"
572,DHI,"That's especially true in markets with good job growth, such as New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. ""That is where you are also seeing low inventories and hence higher price appreciation,"" she said.
"
573,DHI,"Besides getting priced out of hot markets, July's dip in the percentage of first-time buyers might also have to do with those buyers jumping into the housing market in the spring and early summer in anticipation of expected interest-rate increases later this year, housing watchers say.
"
574,DHI,"""Monthly data is very volatile. I think it's going to continue to be a steady rate (up) for first-time buyers,"" Hepp said.
"
575,DHI,"First-time buyers with little savings often turn to Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, which require just 3.5% down.
"
576,DHI,"FHA loans' share of total home originations has been climbing this year. In July, FHA loans made up 22.8% of all home sales, up from 18.1% a year ago, according to a report out Thursday from RealtyTrac, a real estate data company.
"
577,DHI,"'Boomerang' Buyers Are Back
"
578,DHI,"One reason for the uptick may be tied to a cut in insurance fees on Jan. 26 — from 1.35% of the loan to 0.85% — which makes monthly payments lower. On a median-priced home nationwide, that comes to an annual savings of $917 a year, according to calculations made by RealtyTrac in January.
"
579,DHI,"But cash-poor ""boomerang"" buyers returning to the homebuying market after losing their homes in foreclosures in the housing downturn also are causing the mix of FHA loans to tick up, said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac.
"
580,DHI,"A new mortgage-lending option announced on Tuesday by Fannie Mae will make it easier for credit-worthy first-time borrowers with lower-to-moderate incomes to access financing — with as little as 3% down.
"
581,DHI,"The HomeReady mortgage will consider income from non-borrowers, such as parents, and rental income from a portion of the property, such as a room or basement.
"
582,DHI,"""We noted earlier this year that first-time home buyer activity seemed to accelerate as initial down payment requirements started to ease, and this new program should enable even more borrowers to come up with the initial down payment needed to acquire a home,"" wrote analyst Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets in a client note on Wednesday.
"
583,DHI,"Are first-time buyers really coming back? ""I think they are,"" said Blomquist. ""FHA data is going up and (an FHA loan) is typically a first-time buyer.""
"
584,DHI,"Any sparks that send entry-level buyers into the buying pool would be good news for homebuilders that target them, such as D.R. Horton (DHI), with its Express Homes division, and LGI Homes (LGIH), both based in Texas, among others.
"
585,DHI,"Cash Buyers Retreat
"
586,DHI,"Blomquist says first-time buyers also are benefiting from lower numbers of cash buyers looking to buy homes. In July, cash buyers' share fell to an eight-year low, accounting for 22.6% of home purchases, down from 23.7% in June and 26.5% in July 2014.
"
587,DHI,"""Fewer cash buyers in the market opens up the market to first-time buyers,"" Blomquist said.
"
588,DHI,"But first-time buyers might not have much luck in the most expensive markets, where prices are still rising amid tight supply.
"
589,DHI,"Since February, one young couple in Los Angeles, professors at local colleges, lost bidding wars on 12 condos and townhomes, all priced under $800,000, before a bid on a townhome in Marina Del Rey was finally accepted a couple of weeks ago. Their offer of $740,000 was $10,000 above asking price.
"
590,DHI,"""It's rare we don't have multiple offers on properties,"" said Nikki Kilmer, an agent based in West L.A. for national realty company Redfin. ""But I'm seeing less cash buyers now than in June and July. Buyers have slowed their searches down because of the competition and prices (up 5% in L.A. in July vs. a year ago). Or they are deciding to hold off and wait until the market cools down, and maybe jump in around the holidays.""
"
591,DHI,"Before the recent stock-market tumble, the Federal Reserve was widely expected to raise interest rates before the end of the year. But most real estate watchers expect the increases from near-low levels to be minimal and gradual, as the Fed has said. In July, the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.05%, up from 3.98% in June, according to Freddie Mac. On Thursday it was down to 3.84%.
"
592,DHI,"The Mortgage Bankers Association expects the 30-year fixed rate to edge up to 4.4% by the fourth quarter. The gradual increase in rates will likely be accompanied ""by a steady improvement in labor markets, which will help to offset the impact,"" said Lynn Fisher, a VP at the MBA, in an email to IBD. ""If anything, a slowly improving economy will provide first-time home buyers stability and the means to enter the market soon.""
"
593,DHI,"Markets in the ""sweet spot"" for first-time buyers are a cross between affordability and good jobs, says Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.
"
594,DHI,"""There are very few places that have both nowadays. South Carolina is booming and is still relatively affordable,"" she said, pointing to Charleston in particular. ""Nashville is booming, The Midwest is still affordable. The coasts, not so good.""
"
595,DHI,"FHA loans may not be the best solution for all first-time buyers. ""It does come with costs,"" Richardson said. ""The annual (insurance) premium came down but not the upfront fee.""
"
596,DHI,"New FHA underwriting rules that went into effect in mid-June may also make it tougher to for first-time buyers to qualify, including changes in the way deferred student loans are factored into debt-to-ratio calculations and gaps in employment.
"
597,DHI,"What's more, a 3.5% down payment means higher monthly mortgage payments vs. a conventional loan, which typically requires 20% down.
"
598,DHI,"""You don't need a lot of savings but you need income,"" Richardson said. ""That's the sticker. Wages are still stagnant. Incomes have not kept up with price increases.""
"
599,DHI,"In a Redfin survey in July of more than 3,500 buyers, the 1,400 first-time buyers ""almost to the letter said they were concerned about the high prices and the competition,"" Richardson said.
"
600,DHI,"Housing watchers are hopeful that millennials will gradually step up to the homebuying plate in larger numbers. And when they do, they'll likely have a big impact. Their sheer numbers alone are impressive — larger than the baby-boom generation.
"
601,DHI,"""This is not the last hurrah,"" Blomquist said.
"
602,DHI,"But their impact won't likely be felt overnight.
"
603,DHI,"""Just getting millennials out of their parents' homes will take time,"" said housing consultant Leanne Lachman in a speech earlier this year.Some housing experts suggest that millennials may never participate to the same degree as their predecessors in the American dream of homeownership, or at least not anytime soon.About a fifth of the more than 80 million-strong cohort, a demographic usually described as ranging in age from the late teens or early 20s to the mid-30s, still live with their parents or other older relatives.About 50% are renters.

Horton is the nation's biggest homebuilder. According to the National Association of Homebuilders, the company sold 30,455 homes in 2014. This compared to about 21,000 homes for Lennar (LEN) and nearly 17,200 for Pulte (PHM).D.R. Horton builds homes under its namesake brand, as well as Express Homes and Emerald Homes labels.The firm's earnings grew 5% to 88% in the latest four quarters.

739,DHI,"Builders broke ground in July on the most homes since 2007, another sign of the housing market's gathering momentum. That helped boost several homebuilder stocks to longtime highs Tuesday, even as the major market indexes retreated.Starts ran at an annual pace of 1.21 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, above forecasts and 0.2% above an upwardly revised June. Even better: Single-family starts leapt 12.8%, also to near 8-year highs.Permits, which foreshadow starts, dived 16%, led by a 60% drop in the Northeast, where a New York tax credit that expired in June had pulled activity dramatically forward in the spring months.A host of other data suggests the housing market may have finally hit its stride and may even be poised to lead the economy.""We're seeing the market successfully transition from an investor-driven recovery to one that is being driven by traditional buyers,"" said Daren Blomquist, vice president for housing data firm RealtyTrac. ""That's a very good thing because it's more sustainable for the long term.""Cash Is No Longer KingSales of existing homes surged to the fastest pace since 2009 in May, helped by first-time buyers. They represented 32% of purchases in May, the most since 2012 but still solidly below the long-term average of about 40%. June existing-home data will be released Thursday.All-cash sales are also dwindling. Those sales made up 31.9% of the total in May, CoreLogic said, the lowest since July 2008. Cash sales are often considered a proxy for investor, rather than owner-occupied, purchases.Cash buyers are also frequently foreign, Blomquist said, and their presence in the market has helped push up prices. ""We're seeing those pull back and that is opening the door for the traditional buyers. But if global influences push more buyers back into U.S. real estate that could put upward pressure on prices.""As inventory of both existing and new homes remains tight, prices are likely to keep surging, challenging many traditional buyers, especially first-timers.But as the job market heats up, homeownership is starting to seem more attractive — and more feasible — even for millennials.Homebuilder Stocks RiseShares of homebuilders catering to first-time buyers have done especially well.D.R. Horton (DHI) opened an entry-level division, Express Homes, in early 2014. The firm's stock rose 1.4% to a 9-year high. LGI Homes (LGIH), also targeting the entry level market, edged higher Tuesday after hitting a record high Monday. Shares are up 40% since it reported strong earnings on Aug. 5.Lennar (LEN), which also has significant first-time buyers and multiunit construction, rose 3.1%, hitting an 8-1/2-year high.Even luxury-focused Toll Bros. (TOL) advanced, rising 2.8% to its best level in nearly 10 years.The housing market isn't too affected by China, Greece and other overseas concerns, and as those headwinds have rocked markets in recent weeks, that's reduced mortgage rates. While most analysts expect an initial Federal Reserve rate hike in September, Blomquist believes it will turn out to be a ""non-event.""All that is making homebuilders seem like a relatively safe-haven growth sector right now.IBD's Building-Residential Commercial group was rated a solid No. 34 out of 197 industries as of Monday's close, up from 98 just six weeks ago.July's hot starts pace was still about 40% lower than it was during the bubble years of 2005-06, and most analysts think that's healthy. Blomquist calls builders ""wisely cautious.""But a closely watched survey of sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders hit the highest point in a decade in its August read, out Monday.The NAHB's future sales sub-index ""has a decent track record of leading starts by about six months or so,"" ITG Chief Economist Steve Blitz wrote in a client note. ""The relationship suggests single-family starts getting up to 800,000 units (annualized) in the next several months.""Single-family homes currently account for 65% of total starts, down from 80% before the bubble. As homeownership has tumbled to a 48-year low, apartment building has surged to meet demand for rentals.Blomquist thinks it's OK if inventory stays tighter than in the past. There have been about five months' worth of homes available in 2015, compared to the long-term average of six months.Still, lean supply coupled with strong demand is pushing up prices.""The majority of markets are still affordable by historical standards,"" Blomquist said. ""The ones that are unaffordable by historical standards are the big markets with the most jobs. So it is a concern to start to see the affordability equation break down.""

742,DHI,"A couple of Spotlight stocks are testing support at their 50-day moving averages while another triggered a sell rule Thursday as the market sank. Online postal services retailer Stamps.com (STMP) slipped below its key support line as it works on a flat base-on-base with a buy point at 88.97. The stock has traded mostly sideways after a sharp pullback from a new high on Aug. 19.Stamps' fading relative strength line and D- Accumulation/Distribution indicate weakness. The stock has been volatile lately, rebounding from a failed breakout past a prior 75.30 buy point before again retreating .Stamps soared 28% Aug. 7 after posting a better-than-expected 76% jump in Q2 earnings. Profit and sales growth have accelerated in recent quarters. However, profit growth is expected to slow in the current quarter, rising 25% to 89 cents a share from the same period last year.Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) is getting support at its 50-day line. That technically puts the stock in a secondary buy area, but investors should be cautious, with the market's uptrend currently under pressure.The stock is 6% past a 28.80 cup-with-handle entry, just out of buying range, but it had been up as much as 15%. Those who bought at the July 30 breakout should take care to prevent a nice gain from slipping away.Meanwhile, Paycom Software (PAYC) sliced through its 50-day line in heavy volume Thursday, once again triggering a sell signal by falling 8% below a 39.27 buy point.The producer of cloud-based human resources management software initially cleared the buy point Aug. 17 in heavy volume before rolling over and hitting the 8% sell rule five days later.The stock retook the entry Sept. 15, but that was short-lived as the stock pulled back after a secondary share offering, triggering the 8% sell rule a second time.Paycom has posted strong profit and sales growth in recent quarters, but its technical indicators are bearish.

758,DHI,"Scrub the liftoff: The Federal Reserve on Thursday left interest rates near zero, saying 'global economic and financial developments' may curb economic growth and inflation.Fed policymakers stated that ""economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing moderately, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment. On balance, labor market indicators show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.""But inflation has been low, in part due to falling energy prices and non-oil imports. And the Fed highlighted overseas concerns.""Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.""Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker dissented from the decision.Meanwhile, officials also signaled a slower rate hike path going forward, with 13 of 17 saying the Fed will be ready to raise rates by year-end, but that's down from 15 in June. Now three want liftoff next year, while one favors acting in 2017. In June, 15 wanted the Fed to boost rates this year and two favored next year.Fed staff released forecasts trimming growth forecasts, while implying that the central bank sees the natural rate of unemployment at 4.8%-4.9%.Fed Chair Janet Yellen, in a post-announcement press conference, conceded that a case could be made to tighten today. She said that an October rate hike is still on the table, saying if that happens, the central bank will call a press conference. Many analysts had speculated that if the Fed didn't hike in September, it would wait until December, the next scheduled meeting and press conference.Stocks were volatile, rallying to session highs about 45 minutes after the announcement and 15 minutes after Yellen's conference began, but by the close the averages had erased those gains, with the S&P 500 and Dow closing modestly lower.

Permits were stronger than expected, though, running at a 1.17 mil rate, higher than the 1.13 mil in July. That signals a stronger pace of starts may follow, good news for the housing market and for construction jobs.Homebuilder stocks such as D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH) rose 2%-4% Thursday afternoon after the starts data and Fed policy announcement.Jobless claims sink to 2-month lowThere were 264,000 initial jobless claims in the Sept. 12 week, 11,000 below the prior week and forecasts. The 4-week moving average was 272,500, down 3,250. Continuing claims fell 26,000 to 2.237 mil. Claims have trended well below levels normally associated with an economy at full employment.Employment cut 208,000 in benchmark revisionsNonfarm payrolls in March 2015 will be reduced by 208,000 according to preliminary benchmark revisions released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The revisions won't be factored into historical data until they are finalized in early 2016. The report suggests that private payrolls will be cut by 255,000. Professional and business services will be cut by 101,000 jobs while leisure and hospitality will be reduced by 51,000. But construction, transportation/warehouse and government jobs are on track for big upward revisions.Philly Fed index shows manufacturing retreatingThe regional bank's manufacturing survey fell to -6.0 in Sept. from 8.3; economists had expected 6.0. That was the first overall contraction since Feb. '14 and the worst reading since Feb. '13. New orders rose, signaling stronger activity ahead, as did the employment gauge. The future outlook gauge hit its highest point since Jan., at 44. Analysts are watching the manufacturing sector to see if the effect of plunging oil prices on capital spending has diminished. 13.5% of firms expect production to decline by more than 10% in Q3. The New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing index, released earlier this week, held near multi-year lows in September. The current account deficit fell to $109.7 bil in Q2, from $118.3 bil in Q1. Economists had expected a $113.5 bil gap for the broad measure of trade. The lower price of oil weighed on imports while exports were stronger than expected given a strong dollar, a notable concern for both the Fed and multinational corporations. The deficit was equal to 2.5% of GDP in Q2, vs. 2.7% in Q1.U.K. retail sales still strongSales rose 0.2% in Aug., a tick firmer than expected, although the yearly gain of 3.7% was a bit weaker than forecast. Small stores benefitted from a rush to buy school uniforms, and the clothing, textiles and footwear category posted its biggest monthly gain since April. The Bank of England is mulling its first rate hike in 7 years as the economy improves.China wallops Japan's exportsJapanese exports slowed for a second month in Aug., up only 3.1% vs a year ago, vs. forecasts for 4.0%. Exports to China fell 4.6% in Aug. vs. a year ago, the first decline since Feb. The data suggests the Bank of Japan may decide to ease policy further, but also raises broader questions about China's impact on Asia and the entire global economy. Some 41% of U.K. small firms want to leave the European Union, according to a survey from the Federation of Small Businesses. That puts small business at odds with larger corporations, which mostly benefit from stronger ties with Europe. A referendum is expected next year.

778,DHI,"Recent stock market negativity here and elsewhere will likely have an impact on housing in America, experts say — especially in the pricey end of the sector.Whether that impact is good depends on whether Wall Street's drop leads to a prolonged slump in the stock market or if it produces just a temporary correction.If the latter happens, most real estate investors will likely sit tight and wait for the stock market to rebound, watchers say. This could lead to a slowdown in sales of homes priced $1 million and above.If stock markets in the U.S. and China stay down for an extended period, expect more investors to put their money into comparatively stable real estate investments.Danielle Hale, director of housing statistics at the National Association of Realtors, says a stock market flop ""has two different levels.""Some prospective real estate buyers ""might err on the side of caution,"" she told IBD. ""These buyers tend to leave their current investments alone and avoid any new investments.""Others might look to real estate as ""a more stable asset,"" Hale said. ""They look to real estate as relatively less volatile than stocks, so they might increase their investments in real estate.""FBN Securities analyst Joel Locker offers a similar take.""You can probably list examples of both cases,"" he said. ""If the stock market goes down and investors have less discretionary income, some might stay away from real estate. On the other hand, you hear about people in China going into real estate with the stock market down because real estate is a more stable investment right now.""Officials at the NAR sound upbeat about near-term growth prospects for the high-end housing market.""We had decent buying momentum this summer and we think it will continue, especially as the (U.S.) economy and job markets improve,"" Hale said.An NAR report on existing-home sales shows that sales of homes priced at $1 million or higher rose 17.5% year over year in July, the most recent month that data are available. The biggest gain, at 27.2%, came in the $750,000 to $1 million category.Sales in the $1 million and up category ""have been doing quite well,"" Hale said. ""They're not doing quite as well as in past years as far as the growth rate goes, but they've still grown pretty substantially.""Whether that growth rate can sustain itself in the current environment depends in part on how much money foreign investors are willing to spend.These investors are an important element of the market for homes selling for $1 million and higher.In its annual report on foreign homebuyers, released every June, the NAR noted that an estimated 209,000 U.S. homes were sold to foreign buyers during the 12 months ended in March.That represented about 4% of total existing-home sales.The Overseas LookThe total dollar volume for foreign sales, estimated at $104 billion, represented about 8% of total dollar-volume for sales of existing homes.Also, foreign buyers spend a lot more on average than their American counterparts.Foreign buyers paid on average nearly $500,000 for a house vs. the overall U.S. average house price of $256,000.Buyers from China acquired U.S. properties estimated at $28.6 billion in total value during the 12 months ended in March, up from $22 billion in the 12 months prior.That was more than double the $11.2 billion spent by Canadians, who ranked second.How will China's stock market woes affect Chinese investment in U.S. homes?FBN Securities' Locker says there's a ""correlation"" between global stock markets and investments, and that those investments could slow when stock markets turn sour.""You might go buy a second home in New York or Los Angeles when the stock market is going good because you have more discretionary income to spend,"" Locker said. ""When the market falls, that same amount of discretionary income isn't there anymore.""Falling stock markets aren't the only current headwinds to foreign investment in U.S. real estate.Foreign investors also face negative currency and home-price trends.""For people who are looking at real estate as an income-producing investment, it might not make as much sense now as in past years because of the strong dollar and price appreciation,"" Hale said.The really high-end real estate market — which typically means homes priced $5 million and up in large gateway cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco — already has seen signs of a slowdown, says Locker.Taking A TollLocker's coverage includes Toll Bros. (TOL), which is most closely associated with luxury homes among publicly traded stocks.""Toll has already said the New York luxury market was slowing, and that the higher end of homes $5 million to $7 million and above was soft,"" Locker said. ""If you look at their order numbers, they're not what they used to be.""These trends ""kind of triggered people thinking, 'Could it be the U.S. dollar strength and less foreign buyers?' "" he said.Toll Bros. itself has seen a recent slowdown in business, with two straight quarters of lower year-over-year sales.Last quarter it posted its first earnings decline in two years.Other large U.S. builders that don't focus as much on the high end — including D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and NVR (NVR) — have fared much better lately.Lennar has put together a years-long streak of double-digit sales and earnings growth.NVR has delivered two straight quarters of double-digit gains on the top and bottom lines.D.R. Horton has posted five straight quarters of 28%-or-better sales growth and last quarter logged an 88% gain in EPS.

779,DHI,"As apartment rents keep rising, LGI Homes (LGIH) derives more marketing power to turn renters into homeowners. With six straight months of 5% or greater annualized rent growth through July, the national apartment market ""could be in its hottest long-term streak since the Great Recession,"" said market researcher Axiometrics.
"
780,DHI,"July's annual rent growth rate of 5.2% was the highest in four years, Axiometrics notes.
"
781,DHI,"LGI, which is based in the Woodlands, Texas, targets renters for its low-priced, entry-level homes in Texas and seven other states in the Southwest and Southeast.
"
782,DHI,"It sends direct mail to renters in apartment complexes near its new-home communities, explaining how they can afford to own an LGI Home for the same amount or less than their monthly rents.
"
783,DHI,"Instead of advertising the price of a home, LGI often touts homes' monthly payments of $700 to $1,000 a month.
"
784,DHI,"The average price of an LGI home increased 15.8% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier, still a relatively affordable $186,197.
"
785,DHI,"""A big part of their strategy is building a very simple home cost effectively so they can charge a low price for it,"" said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting, a housing-market research firm. ""They have standard floor plans they build over and over.""
"
786,DHI,"Qualifying Folks With Less
"
787,DHI,"Interested buyers are steered to sales offices in LGI communities, where numbers are crunched to determine if they qualify for a low down payment loan — typically a 3.5% product from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
"
788,DHI,"Or for those who qualify, LGI offers ""no money down"" financing.
"
789,DHI,"""If they qualify (for financing), LGI will literally walk them out to a finished home they can purchase,"" said Burns, who compares LGI's marketing strategy to a time-share company's. ""Most of these people don't even think they can become homeowners because they don't have a lot of savings.""
"
790,DHI,"LGI may be one of the smallest of the publicly traded homebuilders among giants such as D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) — which also build for entry-level buyers, among others — but it is one of the fastest growing in terms of percentage gains in home closings.
"
791,DHI,"In the six months ended June 30, it closed on 1,524 homes, up 32.9% from a year ago. The summer months were even stronger. In July, closings jumped 78.7%. In August they climbed just shy of 75%.
"
792,DHI,"The company expects to close 3,000 to 3,300 homes in 2015, up from a previous forecast of 2,800 to 3,200 homes. It closed 2,356 homes in 2014, up 45.7%.
"
793,DHI,"LGI set a new quarterly record for home closings in Q2 — up 29% from a year ago to 853 homes. Revenue jumped 49% to $158.8 million. Earnings climbed 53% to 66 cents per share.
"
794,DHI,"Moreover, management raised earnings guidance for the full year to $2.15-$2.50 per share from $1.85-$2.25 previously. At the mid-point, it would represent growth of 75% over 2014.
"
795,DHI,"""We consistently saw strong and steady traffic, with some of our information centers experiencing standing room only on the weekends,"" CEO Eric Lipar said in the post-Q2 conference call. (Company executives were unavailable to comment for this article.)
"
796,DHI,"More than 54,000 potential customers inquired about a home, averaging 100 leads per community per week, he added.
"
797,DHI,"Shares Soar Since IPO
"
798,DHI,"LGI started building homes in Texas in 2003. Since it went public in November 2013, shares have appreciated about 154%. They soared 23% on Aug. 5, the day LGI reported Q2 results and raised guidance.
"
799,DHI,"At quarter's end, LGI boasted 45 active communities in eight states, up from 14 communities a year earlier. Besides Texas, LGI is building in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, Colorado, North Carolina and South Carolina.
"
800,DHI,"""They are in areas that are among the fastest-growing economies in the country,"" Burns said.
"
801,DHI,"They are also in areas where LGI can build homes relatively cheaply compared to other regions of the country, where land is tighter and more costly. ""You're not going to find them in California or Massachusetts, for example,"" Burns said.
"
802,DHI,"LGI says customers continue to flock to its communities in Houston, despite oil-related pressures on the economy there. Four of its top-five selling communities were in Houston. But they are not in the pricey areas, such as the energy corridor on the west side, where many oil executives live, Burns says.
"
803,DHI,"LGI projects in Denver and Charlotte, N.C., new in the last year, were two of the firm's top performers outside of Texas.
"
804,DHI,"LGI plans to sell homes soon in Seattle, which has seen a surge of young tech workers. ""But it will be in the distant areas of Seattle, not near downtown (where) the land is too expensive,"" Burns said.
"
805,DHI,"LGI also plans to expand into Nashville, Jacksonville, Fla.; Raleigh-Durham and Colorado Springs.
"
806,DHI,"""The model is very replicable,"" Burns said.
"
807,DHI,"Lots Of Lots: 22,200
"
808,DHI,"LGI ended the quarter with roughly 22,200 owned and controlled lots, an inventory it says represents three to five years of supply. In early July it acquired 400 lots in Denver from Jack Fisher Homes.
"
809,DHI,"But since LGI is reliant on low interest rates to keep monthly payments for its target buyers affordable, how would rising interest rates impact its business? Burns says the answer is simple: ""If rates go up, they've said they will build smaller homes.""
"
810,DHI,"Analysts expect LGI's revenue and earnings growth to slow next year but remain in double digits.
"
811,DHI,"In a research note on LGI after its Q2 report, J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut pointed to the company's ""above average and near industry leading"" growth in closings and orders, and gave the stock an overweight rating.
"
812,DHI,"He noted the company's attractive land position, expansion into new markets, strong gross margins and ""unique marketing and sales approach.""As apartment rents keep rising, LGI Homes (LGIH) derives more marketing power to turn renters into homeowners.

The deal will expand Home Depot's reach to professionals who repair and maintain multifamily, institutional and hospitality buildings, a change from the company's focus on products for the home.""Interline Brands can tap into an incremental consumer base that the company hadn't penetrated heavily in the past,"" said Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz. ""It's much more of a commercial business.""

920,DHI,"The housing market is back. A closely watched sentiment index from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) hit a high not seen since the heady days of the housing bubble.Homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH) hit new highs, as did home improvement giant Home Depot (HD).The NAHB index rose 1 point in August to 61. Two subindexes, measuring current sales conditions and the next 6 months, were relatively unchanged at high levels: 66 and 70, respectively.The traffic index rose by 2 points. At 45, it's still below the neutral 50 mark — but traffic has been above that mark only briefly, and that was just before the bubble burst.If homebuilders are bullish, it's probably a signal that housing is in good shape. It could also be a good sign for the rest of the economy, since a humming housing market propels so much other activity, especially hiring.Horton shares rose 2% to a 9-year high Monday. LGI fell lightly after making an all-time high; Lennar (LEN) rose 3% and PulteGroup (PHM) 1%.Meanwhile, in the mobile software industry, GrubHub (GRUB) is facing pressure in online food delivery from rivals led by ride-summoning service Uber, which recently began highlighting its big push into food delivery with a new look on its app.Uber had buried the UberEats app at the bottom of its site. But starting last week, UberEats has appeared prominently next to Uber's car-summoning icon. It's the latest salvo in the app-based food delivery service wars, wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Kevin Kopelman in a research report on Monday.""We view this as a subtle but significant change recognizing food delivery as Uber's second major category ahead of a broader rollout,"" wrote Kopelman.Uber is hiring for its UberEats on-demand meal-delivery service in at least nine U.S. cities and could operate in as many as 15 cities in coming months, Kopelman says.""UberEATS remains small today in both geographic scope, food options and user adoption. However, Uber's recent moves signal some traction in markets where UberEATS has rolled out and point to aggressive expansion of food delivery as a core Uber service,"" Kopelman said.Uber is pioneering the ""ultrafast"" food category, offering a limited selection of prepared foods in thermal bags that couriers deliver within 10 minutes for a flat all-in delivery fee of $3 to $4.Competition from Uber and other companies that deliver food — which include Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — is pressuring GrubHub's order growth, which slowed to a 25% year-over-year gain in Q2 2015 from 33% in Q4 2014, wrote Kopelman. ""We note that new competitors, most notably Postmates, Yelp (YELP)-owned Eat24, DoorDash, Munchery, Caviar and UberEATS, are on track to capture 50% of U.S. industry growth in fiscal 2015 vs. 25% in 2014, and (excluding Uber) have raised $500 million year to date,"" Kopelman wrote.

1034,DHI,"Encouraged by recent financial results and prospects for the housing market to pick up from last year's slow going, some top builders are stepping up the pace of land buying.They'll have to pay more than they used to — in a year when several builders have warned they're facing profit-margin pressures — but they see the higher payments as the price of a rising housing market. And a handful of builder stocks are currently highly rated.Homebuilders such as Toll Bros. (TOL), Meritage Homes (MTH) and TRI Pointe Homes (TPH) are a few builders actively scouting out land.""We're pretty bullish on the housing market right now,"" TRI Pointe CEO Douglas Bauer told IBD. ""We just reported full-year 2014 and fourth-quarter results, and orders for the first two months of this year have improved significantly over 2014.""Bauer says that TRI Pointe will continue to be a ""significant player"" in the 10 markets where it builds and that it will keep growing organically in each of those markets.TRI Pointe operates in markets such as Northern and Southern California, Colorado and Arizona.Adds Frederick Cooper, senior vice president of finance at luxury homebuilder Toll Bros.: ""Speaking for Toll Bros., we are upbeat about the housing market. We just announced (first-quarter fiscal 2015) results, and our contracts were up 24% in value from the prior year.""An improving economy and more job creation are helping to drive up housing demand, Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, told IBD.Yun forecasts that existing-home sales will rise 7% to 5.3 million units this year. He estimates that new-home sales could rise 30% to about 590,000. Yun says it would be up from ""depressed levels,"" but still below a ""normal level"" of 800,000.Morningstar analyst James Krapfel says that in the aggregate, homebuilders will increase their spending on land in 2015. He says that the trend is toward higher and higher land prices, which could put pressure on margins.""That's going to dissuade some builders from reaching their spending budgets,"" he said. ""It has become more difficult to underwrite land"" to ""acceptable"" margins.Added Brad Hunter, chief economist for real estate researcher and consulting firm Metrostudy, a Hanley Wood company, in an email: ""Many (homebuilders) are running low on their supply of lots bought (cheap) at the bottom. So margins will go down as they start using more recently bought lots that were a great deal more expensive. Lot prices shot up starting in 2011-2012. That will have a significant negative impact on profit per house.""Margin Pressure DebatedBut builders, which set ""target"" margins when underwriting land buys, say higher land prices don't necessarily mean margin pressure.""There is a common misconception that when land prices go up, builders' profit margins will be lower, but that's not necessarily true,"" said Meritage Homes spokesman Brent Anderson. ""Land prices normally go up because home prices are going up, allowing you to pay more without sacrificing margin.""And, he adds, home prices have been rising more than land prices over ""much"" of the last three years.Anderson says it's not that difficult to ""more than cover"" the higher price of land when the selling prices of homes are going up.""Once the selling price of homes levels out or starts declining, that's when margins get squeezed and have the potential to come down, potentially below your target level,"" he said. ""You might even lose money on that land.""Meritage Homes looks to earn a 20% gross margin.""Starting with the home prices (in a market), you can back into what you can afford to pay for the land,"" Anderson added.Bauer says TRI Pointe looks to underwrite land at a target gross margin range of 18% to 22%.""The rationale for buying any of our land in any marketplace is fairly consistent (with) our underwriting,"" he said. ""We're looking for land that is well located and is along or near the major transportation and employment corridors.""He says TRI Pointe has all the land it needs for the next couple of years. It's focused on securing land opportunities for 2017 and beyond.""Each land purchase is driven by finding the right deal in the right market that we think makes sense,"" said Toll Bros.' Cooper. ""We already have a multiyear supply of land we own and additional land under option. So we're not going to run out of land anytime soon.""Land Scouts Pick And ChooseToll Bros. owned or controlled 45,300 lots at the end of Q1 2015. It continues to search for land where it operates, says Cooper, typically in ""affluent and desirable"" markets.Toll Bros. has been expanding in California, buoyed by last year's roughly $1.6 billion buy of the homebuilding operations of Shapell Industries, whose land portfolio had about 5,000 fully entitled home sites in affluent Northern and Southern California coastal markets.""We have found the coastal California markets around Los Angeles and San Francisco to be very attractive in terms of demographics and in terms of high barriers to entry, and they're well suited to our product lines,"" said Cooper.Toll Bros. would like to expand more in Dallas, where it sees ""strong"" homebuying activity, Cooper says. It is also looking to expand on the east and west coasts of Florida around Naples and Palm Beach.In a recent Metrostudy report, Hunter said that builders are just starting to extend their geographic reach, looking at land or lots in more ""remote suburban regions that exploded during the boom and then collapsed during the late 2000s.""""More builders are going to start looking in more B and C locations,"" he told IBD. ""To do that, they have to be in more peripheral locations.""In a C location, a developed lot may cost around $30,000, says Hunter, while the U.S. average for a developed lot is around $120,000.""Builders will be going more to remote locations because they can more cost-effectively acquire lots and grow unit volumes,"" he said.Take Meritage Homes: ""Because the few lots available in the inner ring around metro areas are really expensive, we try to go outside that ring and find a sub-market that has lower-priced land and is still close enough to employment centers, shopping and good schools"" to be desirable,"" said Anderson.Five homebuilders carry high IBD Composite Ratings above 90, out of a possible 99. Lennar (LEN) leads with 99. D.R. Horton (DHI), Standard Pacific (SPF), Brookfield Residential Property (BRP) and Toll Bros. are in the top five too.

1035,DHI,"After a few rocky years, housing has found its sea legs. Sales of existing homes popped 5.1% in May to an annual rate of 5.35 million, more than expected and nearly a 6-year high, the National Association of Realtors said.

1036,DHI,"U.S. home prices will rise moderately this year and next as demand picks up but inventory stays low, a panel of housing economists said Friday. Rents rising, perhaps faster, are expected to benefit landlords, while homebuilders undergo a continuing profit pinch.After a 6% gain the last 12 months, home prices should rise 5% both this year and next, predicts Frank Nothaft, chief economist at property analytics provider CoreLogic (CLGX).""By the end of 2017, I think we'll be back up to the peak where we were in 2006,"" he told the National Association of Real Estate Editors (NAREE) conference in Miami, Fla. ""But those are nominal prices ... in inflation-adjusted terms, prices will still be about 20% below the 2006 peak.""He sees home sales also rising 5% this year to the highest since 2009.Homebuying is happening amid stock market gains and better consumer confidence, which hit a 5-month high in a University of Michigan survey out Friday.Panelists saw a variety of reasons for a low inventory of existing homes for sale. They ranged from owners hesitating to sell because they don't find a suitable replacement home to reluctance to move after refinancing a mortgage at a very low rate.Also, large investors who have bought homes are not putting them back on the market, said National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun.Whatever the reasons, the low-inventory phenomenon has an impact on builders, said David Crowe, senior economist at the National Association of Home Builders.""New-home sales come primarily from existing-home sellers,"" he said. ""If we're not getting existing sellers to sell their house, we can't find someone to buy their new house.""So ""builders aren't going to build what they think they can't sell.""That's despite a 30-year mortgage rate that Yun expects to end the year at an average of just 4.3%.Crowe sees single-family housing construction starts rising from 647,000 in 2014 to 726,000 this year and 935,000 in 2016.He notes that after the housing downturn and recession, when builders braked with the marketplace, their supply chains — from labor to lending — were interrupted .Now, Crowe says, ""builders are seeing a profit squeeze — they're having to pay higher prices for their land, and they're having to pay more for labor ... and they're suffering either from no credit or very expensive credit.""A lack of credit availability through small community banks particularly affects regional and local builders, the NAREE panelists said.One thing affecting the housing supply is that many existing homes have become rentals, as owners and small investors seek income streams and as the institutional single-family-home buyers that Yun referenced act as landlords.""We've had a big increase in the one-family-home component of the rental stock,"" Nothaft said.""We've seen rents rise on single-family homes about 4% this year. ... In some markets, double-digit increases in rent and in other markets growth (are) a lot weaker,"" he added, citing April data.Zillow (Z) chief economist, Stan Humphries, sees rents up more than home prices.""Rents are rising 4.3% year over year while home prices are up 3.3% year over year (in May),"" he said. ""We're very tight in terms of rental vacancies. It's no surprise why rents are on a tear in this country.""Humphries says that he continues to be very bullish on rental demand, noting that while some renters will move into homes, millennials and restrained wage growth support the rental market.""The kid in your basement is not going to go buy a house,"" Humphries said. ""He's going to move into rental stock.""The builder stocks in IBD's Building-Commercial/Residential industry group are up a collective 10% this year. Three of the five largest by market cap are highly rated by IBD, with a Composite Rating of 89 or better out of a potential 99: Lennar (LEN), D.R. Horton (DHI) and NVR (NVR). Among builders with a market cap of at least $1 billion, two more have a Composite Rating that high: Ryland Group (RYL) and Tri Pointe Homes (TPH), both with a 91.Homebuilders rallied after the largest by market cap, Lennar, beat analyst estimates in its second quarter earnings report Wednesday. And Lennar stock rose 5%.The builder's gross margin on home sales of 23.8% was down from 25.5% a year earlier.""Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased primarily due to an increase in land costs, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered,"" Lennar said in its report.KB Home (KBH) stock has jumped 16% since its earnings report June 19 that topped analyst estimates. That builder's gross profit margin came in at 16%, down from 18.9% a year earlier, attributed in the report to ""higher land and construction costs, increased pricing pressure in certain markets, start-up field costs associated with new community openings, and an increase in the amortization of previously capitalized interest.""

It was the seventh-straight month of higher yearly tallies, NAR noted, suggesting March may have been a hard act to follow.Realtors see ""elevated levels of buying interest compared to a year ago,"" NAR said, and pointed to tighter inventory as a culprit for lower sales. Total inventory was up 10% in April, but still lower than a year ago, and the 5.3 months of supply on the market is lower than the long-term average of 6 months' worth.That's pressuring prices upward as well: the median price of $219,400 was 8.9% higher than a year ago, and represented the biggest yearly gain in any month since January 2014. Good news for sellers, but more challenging for buyers.The mixed existing-home data left homebuilder stocks such as D.R.

The length of time it's taking employers to fill vacancies is also at an all-time high: 27.3 days as of April, according to data from DHI Group.That's a signal of a tighter labor market, DHI said, as it's harder and harder for employers to find available workers. While the national jobless rate across all industries was 5.5% in May, it's closer to 2% in some industries, like tech and financial services.On the bright side, workers in those in-demand sectors ""have greater job prospects,"" the group said.It took 43.1 weeks to fill positions in financial services, 42.6 for health services and 37.9 for information fields. But it took just 11.8 weeks to fill jobs in construction. Resource employers are taking 14 weeks to fill jobs, down from 22.5 in 2014.

1074,DHI,"Emerging from the recession, energy markets saw a robust real estate recovery as high oil prices ignited exploration and production investment in places like the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas and the Bakken in the Northern plains.Now oil's price plunge threatens to cap the recovery, particularly in cities like Houston, Oklahoma City and Williston, N.D.However, housing analysts such as the National Association of Realtors' Danielle Hale and Trulia's Jed Kolko expect potential slumps in home sales, prices and construction to be confined to energy markets.Largely based on expectations that a strong job market will induce millennials to become first-time homebuyers, the NAR projects that existing-home sales will climb 8% in 2015 and home prices 4% to 5%. It predicts that single-family home starts will jump 21%, and new-home sales 25%.""While uncertainty will have an effect on areas where the overall economy and jobs market are very tied to oil, there are enough areas that will benefit from lower oil prices,"" Hale said. ""So we're expecting the effect to be a wash nationally.""Outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas said Thursday that 38% of the nearly 104,000 U.S. job cuts in January and February were directly tied to oil, the price of which has dropped by about half since July. Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Weatherford International (WFT) alone have all announced layoffs totaling thousands of workers in the last several weeks.The 1,267 drilling rigs operating nationwide at the end of February represented a 28% drop from a year earlier, according to oil service firm Baker Hughes (BHI), which is being acquired by Halliburton.""I'm bullish about every sector of the national economy that's not in oil and gas,"" said Mark Dotzour, chief economist for the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. ""I'm not bullish about the oil and gas impact on Houston, Oklahoma City and Williston.""Housing demand in energy markets has yet to crater, and weakness likely won't surface until late 2015 or in 2016, according to a recent report on energy markets by Trulia, recently acquired by Zillow (Z).In Oklahoma City, some 20,500 homes sold in 2014, a 6.7% rise over 2013, according to the Oklahoma City Area Association of Realtors, which lumps together single-family homes with half-duplexes, condos and patio homes. The median price at year-end was $150,000, about $6,000 higher than a year earlier. In Houston, single-family home sales increased 2.8% in 2014 and the median home price surged 10.6% to $199,000, according to the Houston Association of Realtors.Waiting For The WaveStill, executives at homebuilders Lennar (LEN), Beazer Homes USA (BZH) and D.R. Horton (DHI), which are active in Houston, anticipate some softness in the market, according to comments made during their respective earnings calls in January.Houston-based apartment developer Camden Property Trust (CPT) also projects a slowdown, particularly with 20,000 new apartments slated to open in Houston this year.Even so, its same-store annual revenue growth has averaged 8% over the past four years in the market, and executives expect it to fall only to the 20-year average of 3.4%, according to remarks on the company's earnings call in January. Unlike the oil bust in the 1980s, when Houston was more dependent on the energy industry, the area now boasts strong health care and port sectors, as well as significant refining and petrochemical industries, Dotzour says. He adds that potential homebuyers in careers that are tied to the energy industry, including attorneys and accountants, are in a ""wait-and-see mode.""""I think the unknown right now is, how will the people outside the oil and gas industry respond to the uncertainty in the energy business?"" Dotzour said. ""Will a cardiologist choose to delay buying a home just because three or four oil executives own homes in the neighborhood?""Falling oil prices failed to keep Houston office landlords from lifting rents 3.6% to $27.35 a square foot in 2014, even with 16.6 million square feet under construction, according to commercial property brokerage Transwestern.Between layoffs and firms looking to sublet unused office space, the area's average vacancy rate has likely ticked up 90 basis points from 10.2% at the end of 2014, says Kevin Roberts, president of Transwestern's Southwest operations.Transwestern predicts that Houston's vacancy rate will climb above 12% over the next two years. Office tenants and buyers are already starting to push for better deals, he says, but landlords are hardly panicking.""Everybody is looking for 2015 to be a little bouncy,"" he said. ""The good news is that the real estate is not financially impaired — tenants are pretty healthy and paying rent, and occupancies are still high.""Building Homes In The BakkenIn northwest North Dakota, Williston is ground zero for the Bakken oil formation and is in the midst of a severe housing shortage. The number of residents more than doubled to 29,595 from 2010 to 2014, and a 2014 Williston Economic Development report projected the city's population to approach 40,000 in 2017. Observers remain upbeat, given the steady environment.""Demand has tempered a bit, but for the most part it's still going strong,"" said Terry Metzler, operations manager for Casper, Wyo.-based Granite Peak Development, a land developer that entered the market in 2011.He acknowledges that apartment rents started to decline in the area, but he attributes most of it to an increase in supply.Developers applied for 422 single-family, multifamily and commercial property building permits valued at $435 million in 2014, up from 276 permits totaling $291 million in 2013, according to the Williston Area Home Builders Association.Among other projects, private equity firm KKR & Co. (KKR) and Denver-based Continuum Partners are developing the Ridge, a community of 1,537 single-family homes, apartments and town houses.Like real estate observers in other energy markets, Metzler hopes the oil price dip is temporary. He notes that as drilling has slowed, work at producing wells continues.""I don't think you're going to see the amount of apartments being built slow down that much,"" he added. ""If we see an extremely prolonged period of very low oil prices, we might see things change.""

Respondents have held tenaciously to bullish views, even as the housing rebound has failed to launch throughout the near-6 year recovery and in May alluded to ""pent-up demand moving forward.""But their perception of buyer traffic stumbled again in May.

Cities on the list included Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Charlotte and Nashville.
"
1142,DHI,"These big metro areas saw double-digit price increases but also flat or growing inventory: San Jose, Denver, Atlanta and Austin, Texas.
"
1143,DHI,"While those metrics are a ""good indicator of the current housing situation,"" Yun said they are not necessarily a forecast of future growth.
"
1144,DHI,"""One thing we do know is that these markets are not afraid of raising prices,"" he said. ""But future growth will all be tied to job gains and whether local markets will sustain solid job gains.""
"
1145,DHI,"The ability to sustain solid job gains has become a recent worry in Texas, where declining oil and gas prices are expected to have a negative impact on the state's job growth and housing markets.
"
1146,DHI,"In a recent report, Sterne Agee analyst Jay McCanless lowered his fourth-quarter EPS estimates forKB Home (KBH) given its exposure to states with large oil plays, including Texas, New Mexico and Colorado.

1151,DHI,"""I don't see job cuts necessarily, but we won't see the same level of job creation in Texas,"" Yun said.If location (location, location) is indeed the key to success in real estate, then homebuilders with operations in Seattle, Salt Lake City, Nashville, Tenn., Atlanta and Boston should see good times in 2015.Those are among cities cited by economists as having the best housing market gains this year based on job growth, housing demand, home price strength and other factors. Others frequently mentioned are Dallas, Denver, San Jose, Calif., Charlotte, N.C., and Raleigh, N.C.Although recent quarterly reports from builders have disappointed investors, economists are generally upbeat about the 2015 housing market in most sections of the U.S. They point to improving economic and employment data.""Housing is driven by the local job market, and job gains are accelerating,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the National Association of Realtors. ""It's positive news for all parts of the country.""Cities That WorkThe news is particularly positive for cities, many in the South, that have seen rapid job gains across several different industries. Yun points to Atlanta, Nashville, Charlotte and Charleston, S.C.""We've seen many manufacturing and financial services companies moving operations into Southern states,"" he told IBD.As an example, Yun cites the news last week that Daimler AG's (DDAIF) Mercedes-Benz will move its U.S. division headquarters from New Jersey to the Atlanta metro area. In the summer Boeing (BA) said that the largest of its 787 Dreamliners, the 787-10 launched in 2013, will be assembled in North Charleston, S.C.Other metro areas with strong job markets are Seattle, San Francisco and San Jose, Yun says.""The weak point will be the Northeast from New York to Maine,"" he said. ""That region will be sluggish in terms of home price recovery, with the exception of Boston.""Trulia Chief Economist Jed Kolko has a more cautious take on housing in general. In a report emailed to IBD, Kolko said ""barriers remain to homeownership."" These include difficulty saving for a down payment and poor credit.Not having a stable job ""has become considerably less of an obstacle,"" Kolko said, but affordability ""has become a bigger obstacle.""Kolko noted that certain markets have the right combination of fundamentals, for both buyers and renters, to enjoy strong housing growth in 2015. He cites Boston, Nashville, Salt Lake City, Seattle, Raleigh, Dallas, New York, San Diego, Fresno, Calif., and Middlesex County, Mass.Two important demographic groups — baby boomers and millennials — will also drive housing gains in certain markets, experts say.Cities poised to benefit from an influx of boomers include Denver, Raleigh, Orlando, Fla., and Tucson, Ariz., the NAR reports. Top markets for millennial homebuyers include Austin, Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Seattle and Salt Lake City.Several homebuilders stand to gain from hot housing markets in these and other cities.D.R. Horton (DHI), for example, lists 11 communities in the Seattle area and 13 in greater Salt Lake City. D.R.

1152,DHI,"Homebuilders rose Wednesday on reports that President Barack Obama is expected to announce changes to the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage-insurance premiums. But private insurers fell as competition for mortgage insurance will increase.Obama is seen as cutting annual fees to guarantee mortgages by 0.5 percentage point, according to multiple media reports. That's a turnaround from the premium hikes seen since 2011 to make up for defaults on mortgages after the housing bubble popped. Fees are now at 1.35% of the loan balance.Private insurers fell hard on the report of increased competition from the government in the sector.MGIC Investment (MTG) fell 5.1% to 8.51 on the stock market today. Essent Group (ESNT) plunged 9% to 23. Radian Group (RDN) shares were down 5.1% to 15.68.But homebuilders jumped on the news of more possible homebuyers as millenials look to move out of their parents' houses or away from roommates. KB Home (KBH) shares rose 4.9% to 16.31. D.R. Horton (DHI) shares jumped 5.7% to 35.48.In October, the Census Bureau reported that the homeownership rate in the U.S. fell to the lowest level since early 1995, in part due to entry-level buyers' inability to pass strict mortgage standards.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

1154,DHI,"Attracting first-time homebuyers might seem like courting a herd of underfed cats.Squeezed by tight credit, student debt and low wages, they're still the missing link to a robust housing recovery.But not for LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH), a small homebuilder based near Houston. It sends 12,000 pieces of direct mail ""every single week"" to renters in complexes within 25 miles of one of its active communities, says CEO Eric Lipar.With homes selling for under $200,000 — the average in the past quarter was $166,000 — first-time buyers are the company's prime customers.They've been flocking to its communities, some 38 at last count, including markets in Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Colorado.About 95% of LGI buyers are renters. Their interest ""is triggered by getting a rental-notice increase,"" Lipar told IBD. ""Rising rents work to our advantage for sure.""LGI, which went public a year ago, closed sale on 2,110 homes through the end of November compared with 1,617 for all of 2013.""When a lot of builders were getting out of entry-level, we stuck with it, and we've always been profitable,"" Lipar said. ""Our plan is to stick with first-time buyers.""The company may see busier days, as could other builders aiming at first-timers, such as large-cap builder D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), with its low-priced Express Homes.At a little over 30% of the overall homebuying market, the share of first-time buyers in 2014 hit its lowest point in nearly 30 years, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).Homes Easier To Afford?Affordability is still an issue, but early signs are emerging of a better climate for first-time buyers, including an improving job market.For the three months ended in November, employment in America grew 2% year over year, the strongest rate since the first quarter of 2006. And the key first-time-buyer cohort — the missing 25- to 29-year-olds — showed a 3% gain.Though new jobs ""are not as high-paying as in the past, it's still acceleration,"" said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist with property researcher CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX). ""So it should foreshadow an increase in demand for first-time buyers.""A second reason may also help: Institutional investors are leaving the market. That means ""less competition for starter homes,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the NAR.Investors paying all cash for starter homes had bid up prices, shutting out many first-time buyers. But price gains are decelerating.The latest S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices show a slight drop in the 10- and 20-city composites in October vs. September. They still were up 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively, from a year earlier.""I call it a more organic market, less influenced by distressed sales and artificial support from quantitative easing"" by the Feds, Khater said. He added that ""2015 will really be the first year (in many) that both volumes and price movements will reflect fundamentals — meaning supply, demand and income.""That shift is ""beginning to be reflected in home prices,"" he said.Markets On The MoveKhater notes that many markets with the biggest price gains in 2014 had the strongest underlying economies, based especially on technology and energy industries.Pricey San Francisco, a leading tech center, showed the biggest monthly gain of all 20 cities in Case-Shiller's latest survey, at nearly 1% in October over September.Khater points out that lower-priced homes are seeing faster growth than higher-end homes in the top 25 U.S. housing markets, reflecting tight supply and a lack of new construction for single-family starter homes.Some markets, such as those in the Carolinas and Texas, are seeing robust construction and sales trends, he says.Falling oil prices may make energy-capital Houston — one of the country's hottest home markets recently — and other Texas markets ""vulnerable"" to a slowdown in new oil-related jobs in 2015, says the NAR's Yun.Still, the Lone Star State is diversified, ""so it may be able to withstand the potential decline because other sectors of the economy continue to show strength,"" he said. Also, Texas has more affordable homes relative to many other housing markets around the nation.Jobs And Sun Belt MigrationYun sees housing demand growing in Rocky Mountain states such as Colorado and Utah, thanks to strong job growth.Meanwhile, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas are benefiting from corporate relocations as well as retirees moving in.""I see opportunities on two ends,"" said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine, Calif.""The entry-level buyer will come back, though more slowly than most people think,"" he said. ""And the older buyer — the retiree — is already back and buying homes, a lot of them paying all cash.""Today's generation of first-time buyers are older than their predecessors because they have delayed marriage and having children, Burns says.""The ultimate impetus (for buying a first home) is when you need to put a child into a school. We're seeing more of those buyers,"" he said.Still waiting to make their move are many buyers who bought entry-level homes in the early 2000s and saw their homes plummet in value during the housing downturn. Now largely in their early 40s, they don't have enough equity to move, Burns says.He expects that older baby boomers will continue to support the housing market in 2015 and beyond as they sell their homes at a profit and then use the cash to buy other homes.""We're seeing active-adult communities pop up all over the country,"" Burns said. ""They're doing great.""Especially active on that front is homebuilder PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), with its Del Webb Communities.In a report this week, analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee said he prefers builders ""who concentrate on older, move-up buyers bringing equity from their previous home to the closing table.""His top picks among that group are PulteGroup, WCI Communities (NYSE:WCIC) and Ryland Group (NYSE:RYL).New low-down-payment programs from Fannie Mae (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCBB:FMCC) may spur healthy order growth for eligible first-time buyers in 2015, he noted, ""if originators take the bait.""He expects the lack of mortgage availability for first-time and subprime buyers to continue into 2015 ""because we do not believe banks are being compensated for the tail risk on mortgages.""Still, slower price appreciation opens up opportunities for potential new homebuyers after months and years of robust price gains ""acted to squeeze out new buyers,"" noted Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with Sterne Agee, in a report this week.""Slower price gains and still historically low interest rates (around 4%) may work to encourage new demand in 2015,"" she wrote.Housing watchers don't expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates much, if at all, in the near term, perhaps not until mid-2015 at the earliest.Meanwhile, CEO Lipar of LGI Homes is counting on more first-time buyers to come his way as they ""save more and work on their credit scores.""""Demand will always be there from people who rent,"" he said.

1188,DHI,"The homebuilding comeback anticipated this year didn't happen.High expectations were built around views that demand would finally spike after years of post-recessionary lethargy among traditional buyers.""2014 was a big disappointment,"" said Brad Hunter, chief economist at Metrostudy, a unit of Hanley Wood that studies the homebuilding sector.""In the beginning of the year everyone thought single-family housing starts would be up 20%, and it turns out they will be up 4% (by Metrostudy's estimate).""But builders and other housing watchers are more confident about 2015, as building permits have recently increased.Even so, many housing watchers are not expecting a huge jump in new-home construction. ""It is going to be very modest,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee. ""Arguably, it is what we want to see. It ensures a more sustainable recovery. I'd be concerned if we had seen another bubble run-up.""Going Where The Buyers AreBuilders have learned to be patient and pace themselves. That means they are allocating resources to areas with the best demand, such as certain markets in Texas, California, Florida and Georgia — Forsyth County north of Atlanta, for example.Single-family housing starts in some markets were up as much as 45.8% over the 12 months ending Sept. 30, says Metrostudy. That high mark was in Naples/Fort Myers in Southwest Florida.""It's a market that was badly beaten up during the downturn, but it's also a market with strong fundamentals,"" Hunter said.Besides being a retirement and second-home magnet for affluent buyers, the area has a university, growing middle class and job growth, he says.""Wealthy people need estate planning, lawyers, accountants, bankers and medical care. There's a very large medical industry there,"" Hunter said.Top homebuilders in the Naples/Fort Myers market are PulteGroup's (PHM) active-adult division Del Webb, Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI), according to a survey by drive-by teams from Metrostudy.Existing-home prices in the region's Lee County are back to early 2004 levels and new homes are mostly in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, Hunter says.Home construction in Southern California is up 28.4% in the same recent 12-month period, Metrostudy says, with the greatest gains in another bruised area, the Inland Empire east of Los Angeles.""All the excess supply is gone,"" Hunter said of the Inland Empire's Riverside-San Bernardino area near the I-15 corridor flanking L.A. ""That area turned around from being massively overbuilt and with falling prices to coming back strong and prices moving up.""The top two builders in that market are KB Home (KBH) and Lennar, according to Metrostudy.Lennar is also active in other parts of California and in Texas, including Houston, which is the No. 1 market for housing starts.Still, Stuart Miller, CEO of Lennar, believes the housing market is far from recovered. In remarks after the firm's latest quarterly results were released, he compared the ""extremely low volume of dwellings"" built over the past seven years to a housing depression.""Before this downturn, anything below 1 million housing starts in a year was considered almost a housing depression,"" he said. ""This recovery is just now getting us back to that level of starts.""The recovery is still only at the ""halfway"" mark back to normal, says David Crowe, chief economist with the National Association of Home Builders. He was referring largely to single-family homes, which he said comprises the bulk of the home-building industry.""This is a much slower recovery (than) from any of the recessions since the Great Depression,"" Crowe said.However, multifamily construction, mostly rental apartments, is back to normal as builders try to satisfy demand from millennials and others who can't afford or don't want to buy a home just yet.""A normal market would be at least 1.5 million housing starts (annually),"" said Piegza. ""We were down to 500,000 (in 2009) and it took five years to make progress up to 1 million. Given that trajectory, it would be five-plus years to get to 1.5 million, when we can say it's a healthy market.""Overall housing starts in October were pacing at an annualized rate of a little over 1 million units, 2.8% below the revised September estimate but 7.8% above October 2013, the Census Bureau said last week.Crowe of the builders' trade group thinks a back-to-normal builders' market will occur sooner, in 2017. There would have to be a lot of fast catching-up.Crowe thinks single-family home starts will increase next year to around 800,000, from an expected 640,000 this year. If that comes to fruition, it would be the best gain since the recession ended.New-Home Sales Rise SlowlyActual sales of new single-family homes tracked at an annualized pace of 458,000 in October, the Census Bureau said Wednesday. That is just 0.7% above September's revised rate and 1.8% above the 450,000 seen in October 2013.""The low was about 350,000, so we haven't made much progress in terms of home sales,"" Piegza said.Like other housing watchers, she blames the usual suspects: strict lending, slow wage growth and low numbers of first-time homebuyers, due in part to millennials being dragged down by student debt and low wages.""It comes back to the ability to finance, access to credit and being able to put 20% down,"" she said. ""Credit is looser, but it is still tight.""Toll Bros. (TOL), which targets the luxury market, is not as impacted by credit challenges as builders with lots of entry-level products. Its buyers typically put 30% down, and 20% pay all cash, Hunter says, ""so they are somewhat insulated from these mortgage issues these days.""October's median price of a new house rose to $305,000 in October from $264,300 a year earlier, the Census Bureau said. That gain ""reinforces our view that move-up and luxury buyers remain the most eligible buyer in the U.S. market,"" noted analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee.As for existing homes, pending sales fell modestly in October, according to the National Association of Realtors' Pending Home Sales Index, which is based on contract signings. The index fell 1.1% to 104.1 from 105.3 in September. Anything above 100 is viewed as an average level of contract activity.Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, noted less competition from investors paying all cash.The median price for an existing home of any type in October rose 5.5% from a year earlier to $208,300. Last year through October the average month's year-over-year gain was 11.5%, the NAR says.Price gains, moderating though they are, give previously stuck homeowners with little or no equity ""the ability to sell,"" Yun noted. And when an existing home sells, oftentimes the seller will move into a newly built home.

He said that he is seeking a mandate for delaying the tax hike. But results could weaken his party's hold on the parliament, and a snap vote is widely unpopular. The Nikkei stock index rallied 2.2%.Homebuilder sentiment rises in NovemberThe National Association of Home Builders' Housing Market Index rose 4 points to 58, near September's 9-year high. Homebuilders are more confident about current and future sales, and less gloomy about buyer traffic. The index follows generally upbeat earnings and orders from builders D.R. Horton (DHI), Beazer Homes (BZH) and Toll Bros. (TOL) last week, but housing activity remains well off boom-era peaks.Producer costs rise, a surpriseThe producer price index (PPI) rose 0.2% in October, defying expectations for a 0.1% decline, the Labor Dept. said. Wholesale gasoline prices plunged 5.8%, but auto costs leapt on new 2015 model sticker prices. Beef and pork costs rose about 6%. Meanwhile, wholesale prices for services leapt 0.5%, the most since July 2013. The PPI ex food and energy advanced 0.4%. Still, with gas prices continuing to tumble this month, economists aren't worried about inflation. Wholesale inflation was just 1.6% last month. Same-store sales rose 0.2% in the week ended Nov. 15 after a 1.5% gain in the prior week, according to the ICSC-Goldman tally.

It was the ZEW index's first monthly increase of 2014. Recent eurozone GDP data suggest that the economy is stabilizing, according to ZEW Pres. Clemens Fuest. ""However, the economic environment remains fragile, not least due to ongoing geopolitical tensions."" Europe's No. 1 economy has struggled amid eurozone woes and Western sanctions vs. Russia over Ukraine. U.K. inflation rose to 1.3% in October from September's 5-year-low of 1.2%.

"
1193,DHI,"From flat income growth to housing crash nightmares, potential first-time homebuyers possess plenty of reasons to shy from ownership, a trend that could aggravate weakening home price appreciation.The National Association of Realtors (NAR) early this month said that first-time homebuyers accounted for 33% of the market in its latest annual survey, a year-over-year drop of five percentage points and well below the long-term average of 40%.It's the lowest first-timer participation rate since 1987, and it coincides with the NAR's forecast that 4.9 million home sales in 2014 will fall 200,000 short of last year's total. Among impediments, the NAR and other observers say that student debt burdens and rising rents hinder the ability of young adults to save for a down payment.What's more, many young professionals are underemployed. Those who have landed jobs haven't enjoying the same wage growth as baby boomers and Generation X, says Stan Humphries, chief economist for Seattle-based online housing marketplace Zillow (Z).Those demand suppressors may require home sellers to dial back price expectations, particularly in the short term.""Assuming that income growth returns to normal, it won't have any long-term impact,"" said Humphries, referring to the dearth of first-time homebuyers. ""But right now we are having trouble getting income growth back to normal, and we can't have a functional economy or a functional housing market without it.""Paycheck DoldrumsPrivate-sector average hourly wages haven't increased more than about 2% annually the past few years, and growth in 2014 is on pace to continue the trend, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In addition to enduring miserly income expansion and other demand inhibitors, millennials are also avoiding marriage and baby rearing, which typically lead to home purchases, Humphries says.After increasing 19% from the trough in February 2012 to the end of 2013, home price appreciation across 20 major cities has been slowing for a large part of this year, according to the most recent S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.Average year-over-year appreciation of 5.5% in August was 110 basis points lower than the annual gain in July, according to the report. Moreover, price growth in August was just 0.2%, compared with 0.6% in July.""We've had a nice period of growth in home prices,"" said Daren Blomquist, a vice president of Irvine, Calif.-based RealtyTrac, a provider of housing data and analytics. ""But I think we're going into a period of stagnant price appreciation, and the only thing that could change that is if incomes went up.""Few ChoicesPart of the decelerating price increases can be traced to single-family home investors pulling back in the bellwether markets of Phoenix, Southern California and Atlanta, among others, Blomquist says.Aggressive investors primarily acquired entry-level homes and pushed up prices as much as 30% in some markets, he says. That in turn helped many ""underwater"" homeowners — those with more mortgage debt than the home is worth — return to positive equity.But ballooning price appreciation priced many entry-level buyers out of the market, adds Blomquist, who estimates that 8 million homeowners are still underwater, down from 13 million a couple of years ago.The still-large number of underwater homeowners is crimping supply, Humphries says, because a majority live in entry-level houses and can't sell them.""Even if buyers have navigated the demand issues — they have a decent job with a decent wage, and are married and having kids and want to buy a home,"" Humphries said, ""the number of homes available is dramatically less than it was pre-recession.""Low Down PaymentsBlomquist is skeptical about the effectiveness of a plan that Federal Housing Finance Agency head Mel Watt has introduced, which would allow Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) to purchase home loans that are made to ""lower-wealth borrowers"" who make a 3% down payment.The Federal Housing Administration already has a 3% down payment program, and Fannie and Freddie can now buy mortgages with as little as a 5% down payment, he says.A recent RealtyTrac study also found that, even with a 3% down payment, would-be buyers with a median income and an average student or car loan would be able to afford a monthly mortgage payment in only 48% of U.S. counties. Without debt, 92% of the counties would be affordable.""In my mind, the biggest thing weighing down first-time homebuyers right now is debt,"" Blomquist said.Homebuilders Stepping UpFederal agencies aren't alone in their efforts to stimulate home buying, however. Forth Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton (DHI) is rolling out its Express Homes division in the Southwest, Texas and the Southeast, focusing on attracting entry-level purchasers for homes priced around $150,000.Meanwhile, LGI Homes (LGIH), based in The Woodlands, Texas, is solely focused on the entry-level homebuyer in virtually the same regions. It not only offers homes for around $165,000 but also provides credit counseling and no-down-payment financing for qualified homebuyers.Homebuilders of late have generally focused on building much pricier homes, particularly given that lots entitled for development have escalated in cost, says Jody Kahn, senior vice president of Irvine-based John Burns Real Estate Consulting, an independent housing industry researcher and consulting firm.""But a lot of builders are anxious to see a return of the first-time homebuyer segment,"" said Kahn, who conducts monthly surveys of 225 homebuilding executives from the firm's Portsmouth, N.H., office. ""Even builders that don't cater 100% to the entry-level buyer say that they're seeing an uptick in entry-level traffic, which is a step in the right direction.""

Horton (DHI), PulteGroup (PHM), Ryland Group (RYL) and M/I Homes (MHO) reported earnings before the stock market open Thursday, with D.R. Horton strong across the board as its peers missed views or delivered a blend of positive and negative results.Those reports came on top of the week's earlier news that sales of both new and existing homes declined in March, as rising prices and low inventories slowed the housing market's recovery.D.R. Horton, the No. 3 builder by market cap, got an 8% stock price lift Thursday, while M/I Homes jumped 9%, Pulte gained about 2% and Ryland rose about 3%. Other homebuilder stocks moved up by similar percentages, lifting IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group 3%.First-Time Buyers AppearAt D.R. Horton, which sells many homes under $250,000 to first-time buyers, CEO Donald Tomnitz said on a conference call with analysts that ""we are experiencing solid demand and profitability in the heart of our business.""D.R. Horton earned 38 cents a share for its fiscal second quarter, which ended in March. EPS was up from 32 cents the previous year and 4 cents above consensus views.The company's homebuilding revenue rose 22% to $1.7 billion. The average selling price increased 10% to $278,900, helping to push up the home-sales gross margin by 210 basis points to 22.5%. Orders rose 9% in homes and 20% in value.Pulte, which ranks second in market cap, logged Q1 earnings of 19 cents a share, down from 21 cents a year earlier and a penny below views. Revenue fell 3% to $1.12 billion, missing estimates for $1.2 billion. Home closings dropped 10.4%, while average selling prices of homes delivered rose 10.5% to $317,000. New orders slid 6%.""We experienced good demand in the quarter with generally stable to rising prices and gains in absorption paces suggestive of buyers coming back into the market especially in March,"" Pulte CEO Richard Dugas said on a conference call with analysts. ""We'll have to see how demand develops over the remainder of the spring selling season but we're certainly encouraged by what we saw.""Also Thursday, Ryland said that its first-quarter EPS fell 2% from the prior year to 42 cents, missing estimates for 45 cents. It happened even as revenue rose 31% to $489.7 million, topping views for $473.2 million. Closings increased 12.5% to 1,470 units, while the average closing price climbed 18% to $327,000. Orders also advanced.M/I Homes reported Q1 earnings rose 15% to 23 cents a share, better than expected. Revenue rose 23% to $234.8 million but missed forecasts. New contracts fell 6%.Wednesday, Meritage Homes (MTH) missed earnings views and reported a dip in orders. NVR (NVR) badly missed views on Monday.The Commerce Department said Wednesday that sales of new homes declined 14.5% in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 384,000, down from February's revised pace of 449,000. It was the second straight monthly decline and the lowest rate since July 2013.Builders had hoped that warmer weather in March might bring more activity. But a number of challenges have weighed on the industry, including supply constraints, rising prices and tight lending standards for buyers and builders.""We believe strict mortgage underwriting standards are a head wind for all our builders,"" Sterne Agee analyst Jay McCanless said in a research note Thursday.The median sales price for new homes in March climbed 11.2% from the prior month to $290,000.

1308,DHI,"Residential building started 2014 on stronger financial footing than recent years, fueled by the ongoing recovery in the housing market, according to private company data from Sageworks.In a preliminary analysis of financial statements for the 12 months that ended in January, Sageworks found that private residential construction companies' sales and profits remained healthy, as did other key financial fundamentals such as liquidity ratios. The report includes data from general contractors, builders and design-build firms.Profitability continued to strengthen from the last couple of years. Residential construction companies, on average, had a hefty 7.4% net profit margin for the 12-month period, up from 3.6% margins in 2012, according to the data released Tuesday.After seeing some steep declines during the housing bust, the firms regained some sales momentum in the last two years as the market and economy have improved. In the last 12 months, sales for residential construction companies increased about 14%, on average, which is close to the 15% percent growth of 2012 and up from the 2% growth averaged over the last five years.Liquidity ratios were also healthy in 2013. The debt-service coverage ratio, which shows a firm's ongoing ability to repay both principal and interest on loans, was 4.39, on average — the highest since 2006.Many of the nation's top public builders also started the year posting healthy sales and profit gains.Lennar (LEN), the largest homebuilder by market cap, saw earnings surge 150% from a year earlier to 35 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, which ended in February. Revenue gained 38%.Another top homebuilder, D.R. Horton (DHI), posted earnings of 36 cents a share for its fiscal Q1, which ended in December. That was up 80% from the prior year.

That was vs. 26 cents a year earlier and 7 cents over consensus views.Revenue rose 37% to $1.36 billion, atop estimates for $1.28 billion.

""We believe that the housing market is still in the early stages of recovery.""In a Thursday morning note, Sterne Agee analyst Jay McCanless said Lennar's average home in backlog was priced at $342,315 vs. his forecast of $325,000.

1348,DHI,"Lennar (LEN) on Thursday became the second homebuilder in as many days to deliver better-than-expected quarterly results as rising home prices and new orders helped offset the severe winter in some markets.Reporting before the market open, Miami-based Lennar logged earnings of 35 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, ended in February. That was vs. 26 cents a year earlier and 7 cents over consensus views.Revenue rose 37% to $1.36 billion, atop estimates for $1.28 billion. Lennar delivered 3,609 homes in Q1, a 13% year-over-year gain.Lennar's results followed those of Los Angeles-based KB Home (KBH), which easily topped fiscal Q1 sales and earnings views on Wednesday.Both companies faced challenging weather in some markets. New-home construction in the U.S. declined for the third straight month in February, according to a Tuesday report from the Commerce Department, which said harsh weather was partly to blame.However, KB and Lennar both got a boost from higher home prices during the quarter.A Pop In PricesKB's average selling price rose 12% from a year earlier to $305,200. Lennar saw a 17% increase in the average sale price, to $316,000. Lennar's new orders rose 10% to 4,465 homes — a promising indicator of future revenue.""Despite harsh weather conditions that impacted sales and construction during the quarter in some of our markets, we were able to achieve healthy year-over-year increases in both new orders and deliveries,"" CEO Stuart Miller said in a statement.He also sounded upbeat about the overall condition of the U.S. housing market.""Although it is still too early to predict the strength of the spring selling season, we are optimistic that the housing market is continuing to recover, and that the fundamental drivers of that recovery remain intact,"" Miller said. ""We believe that the housing market is still in the early stages of recovery.""In a Thursday morning note, Sterne Agee analyst Jay McCanless said Lennar's average home in backlog was priced at $342,315 vs. his forecast of $325,000. He also said Lennar offered fewer incentives during the first quarter.""We believe this is a positive indicator for Lennar's pricing power in the market,"" McCanless noted.

Volume was mixed, dipping about 1% on the NYSE and rising 4% on the Nasdaq compared to Tuesday, according to preliminary data.Makers of consumer telecommunications stocks were among the biggest losers in the stock market today. Motorola Solutions (MSI), which makes two-way radios and other communications products, plunged more than 8% despite better-than-expected Q3 profit and sales results. The stock, which had been working on a flat base, crashed through its 50-day moving average before finally steadying just above its 200-day line.Tesla Motors (TSLA) led shares of automakers higher, soaring 11% as the electric vehicle maker's Q4 delivery outlook trumped a weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings report. The stock is testing resistance at its 200-day line but remains 19% off its 52-week higher.HomeAway (AWAY) rocketed in post-session trading after Expedia (EXPE) agreed to buy the online marketplace for vacation rentals for $3.9 billion. The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of next year pending regulatory approval, is expected to help Expedia compete against home-rental businesses such as Airbnb.Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) rose in after-hours trading following its Q3 earnings report. Profit for the period rose 33% to 57 cents a share on a 41% gain in revenue to $4.5 billion. Both topped Wall Street estimates.The company said the number of daily active users rose 17% from a year ago to 1.01 billion on average for September. Mobile daily active users jumped 27% to 894 million on average during the month.Facebook rose 1% during the regular session. It's out of buying range from a 96.59 buy point.Qualcomm (QCOM) was down sharply after hours after its outlook for the fiscal first quarter that ends in December trailed analysts' estimates. That outweighed better-than-expected results in the latest period.Disney (DIS), Celgene (CELG), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Nvidia (NVDA) are among companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings Thursday.Economic reports due Thursday include initial jobless claims for the week ended Oct. 31 and Q3 productivity data.

1351,DHI,"As mortgage rates rise, subprime loan products are expected to creep back into the lending mix in a more meaningful way.And that could be a catalyst for homebuilders with high exposure to entry-level buyers, said Sterne Agee analyst Jay McCanless in a research note this week.He says KB Home (KBH) may be the ""best positioned"" of homebuilders to benefit from the returning product, which all but vanished after the housing market crashed.Not only does KB Home cater to first-time buyers, it already has a relationship with mortgage servicer Nationstar Mortgage (NSM), which is one of the companies seen growing subprime product. Another emerging player: Wells Fargo (WFC).Other builders that should benefit from greater availability of subprime credit are D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), Beazer Homes (BZH), and MDC Holdings (MDC), McCanless said, noting that entry-level homes account for 40% or more of their sales mix.Los Angeles-based KB Home has long targeted first-time buyers. But as tight credit shut many would-be first-timers out of the market in the last few years, the company has been shifting into the move-up market more. Builders' shift to higher-priced product has left holes in the entry market.""We have many first-time buyers who are trying to find a foothold in the market,"" said Geoff McIntosh, co-owner of Main Street Realtors in Long Beach, Calif., which is south of Los Angeles. But supply is tight and new construction in the entry-level market on the coast is ""insignificant,"" he added.Entry-level buyers made up just 26% of existing home sales nationwide in January, according to the National Association of Realtors. That's down from the 40% to 45% historic norm.""We anticipate a return of subprime lending could close the gap between the 26% and the historical 40%-to-45% range and potentially lift the gross amount of home sales higher in a given month,"" McCanless wrote.KB Home, for one, might finally be in the right place at the right time with its original focus on first-time buyers. Shares have moved up roughly 10% in three days.

1457,DHI,"As the peak earnings season kicks in this week, five homebuilder stocks will be among dozens of companies reporting their March quarters, days after reports showed disappointing housing starts for the month.If analyst estimates prove right, builder earnings for the quarter won't be much to write home about — unless you like to share uninspiring news.Earnings per share of the five reporting this week are seen falling from year-ago levels or showing little growth.Reston, Va.-based NVR (NVR) starts the parade on Tuesday, followed by No. 1 builder D.R. Horton (DHI) on Wednesday and PulteGroup (PHM), Meritage Homes (MTH) and small-cap M/I Homes (MHO) on Thursday.D.R. Horton's profit is expected to show zero growth, coming in the same as last year at 38 cents a share, according to the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. PulteGroup's profit is seen rising 5% to 20 cents, the best growth rate in the group.The rest are expected to show declines of 13% (Meritage) to between 22% and 25% (M/I Homes and NVR, respectively).Bad weather during the quarter may affect some of the builders. NVR, for example, has a majority of its communities in the hard-hit mid-Atlantic and Rust Belt, noted analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee in a preview report on Friday.Of the five reporting, McCanless has buy ratings on only two — PulteGroup and Meritage. (He didn't report on M/I.) He expects Pulte's year-over-year orders in the quarter to be up 5%, above expectations for a little over 2%, and the average selling price to also come in above views, up 6.3% to $336,936.Meritage previously reported that January orders jumped 48% vs. a year earlier, which McCanless attributed to the addition of Legendary Homes in August and improving sales in the Southeast. He sees unit orders growing 16% for the full quarter, below views.McCanless noted that Fort Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton is taking a ""cautious approach"" in Texas oil markets of Houston and Midland, which accounted for 6% of the builder's fiscal 2014 housing revenue.In D.R. Horton's December-ending first quarter, orders were higher than expected and its speculative home count grew by more than a third, McCanless noted.D.R. Horton is the highest rated stock in IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group, with a Composite Rating of 96 out of a possible 99. Next highest is Lennar (LEN), which reported its February-ending first quarter last month. Lennar's earnings and revenue in the quarter topped views but gross margin fell, as expected, on higher costs.Homebuilder stocks fell in unison late last week after government data showed that March housing starts were up just 2% to an annualized rate of 926,000, missing views for 1.04 million. Starts were 2.5% lower than a year earlier.RELATED:Will Builders See Spring Home Sales Heat Up?

Those figures come as builders ramp up home construction from low-growth years.The median price is seen rising about 6% for all types of existing homes and 3% for new houses, in the National Association of Realtors' April outlook report.""Several markets remain highly competitive due to supply pressures, and Realtors are reporting severe shortages of move-in ready and available properties in lower price ranges,"" NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement Monday with the latest pending home sales report.""The return of first-time buyers this year will depend on how quickly inventory shows up in the market,"" he said.Following demand patterns, homebuilders the past few years have tended to tailor their price ranges toward move-up and luxury buyers, not first-timers, though some homebuilders have waded back into that market in anticipation of an eventual flock of first-timers.""First-time home buyers remain absent from the market, restricted by tight lending conditions,"" National Association of Home Builders Chief Economist David Crowe said in a data release in March.Low End Lifting?With demand rising at the low end of the market for existing homes, prices for distressed properties have been going up.Homebuyers — whether they're investors or first-timers looking for an affordable place — now get about a third off the price of a comparable nondistressed home, according to the latest estimate by RealtyTrac. But that's not as advantageous as the 40% off they got in September 2013, says Daren Blomquist, a RealtyTrac vice president.Real estate site Zillow (Z) predicted in December that 2015 would be a ""breakthrough year for first-time buyers "" amid rising rents. It predicted that the best markets for first-time buyers, based on a variety of factors, would be Pittsburgh; Hartford, Conn.; Chicago; Las Vegas and Atlanta.Builder Stocks In FocusBuilder stocks in IBD's Builders-Commercial/Residential industry group are up 8% collectively this year, and the group ranks No. 55 in performance among 197 groups tracked.Four stocks in the group hold an IBD Composite Rating above 90 (out of a possible 99) — Lennar (LEN), D.R. Horton (DHI), Standard Pacific (SPF) and Toll Bros. (TOL) The ratings are based on a variety of metrics from earnings growth to stock market performance.Toll and Meritage Homes (MTH) are among builders who've told IBD they're encouraged by the recent pace of sales. The spring selling season is a key period for homebuilders, when homebuyers come out from wherever they have been wintering to shop for a new place.The homebuilding industry faces profit-margin pressure this year amid potentially higher costs for lots and labor than during the lull years.Despite the higher sales forecast for new homes this year in the NAR's April outlook, 33.4% vs. 1.6% in 2013, housing starts are lagging so far this year. They fell in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 897,000 in a Census report, 3.3% below the year-earlier rate.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter: @IBD_DHowell.Related: Home Price Gains Follow Job Growth; Which Cities Rose?

1679,DHI,"A couple of months ago Tri Pointe Homes was a smallish homebuilder with a heavy concentration in California and little fanfare on Wall Street.Today the company is poised to become one of the nation's 10 biggest builders as it prepares to move into a handful of new, high-growth markets from one coast to the other.For that, Tri Pointe (TPH) can thank its proposed buyout of Weyerhaeuser Co.'s (WY) homebuilding division in a $2.7 billion deal announced Nov. 4.The acquisition brings Tri Pointe around 27,000 lots and five brands: Pardee Homes in Southern California and Nevada; Trendmaker Homes in Texas; Maracay Homes in Arizona; Winchester Homes in the Washington, D.C., metro area; and Quadrant Homes in the Puget Sound region of Washington.The deal is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2014. When it does, Tri Pointe would have a market cap of around $2.5 billion, going by current stock levels. That would move it into the top 10 among U.S. homebuilders. The company's current market cap is about $600 million.Good Supply Of LandOfficials involved in the deal said the Weyerhaeuser unit, known as Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co., or Wreco, will give Tri Pointe nine years' worth of land and lot supply.According to industry reports, that compares favorably with the roughly 7.4 years of average supply for leading U.S. homebuilders like Pulte Group (PHM), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN).Part of Tri Pointe's new supply will be in and around large urban markets such as Las Vegas, Houston, Phoenix and Seattle.A majority of the lots — more than 16,000 — are in California, where available land in top markets is shrinking.On a conference call with analysts, Tri Pointe CEO Doug Bauer said the combined company will give Tri Pointe ""a stronger and deeper California market position, a relatively high average-selling-price product line (and) land positions and brand recognition in the nation's most attractive markets.""Wall Street reacted favorably to the news. Tri Pointe's stock, which touched a low of 13.43 on Oct. 9, has since rallied about 35% and currently trades near 18. The stock went public in late January at an IPO price of $17.Even before the deal was announced, Tri Pointe was seeing sales increase sharply. For the past five quarters, revenue has risen by at least triple-digit percentages from a year ago. The Wreco assets should kick growth into an even higher gear, analysts say.""The acquisition of about 27,000 lots in several of the nation's best housing markets will permit Tri Pointe Homes to continue its robust growth pace,"" Brendan Lynch, analyst at Sidoti & Co., noted in a report.""In addition to bolstering inventory, we think Wreco's land .. . will contribute to gross margin expansion to 23.5% in 2014 and 24% in 2015, vs. our call for 22% in 2013,"" Lynch added.Under the terms, Weyerhaeuser shareholders will get 130 million shares, or 80.5% of the combined company. Tri Pointe will get 19.5%.However, Tri Pointe's management will run the firm. Bauer will remain as CEO and Barry Sternlicht will continue as chairman. Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group owns a large stake in Tri Pointe.The Tri Pointe-Weyerhaeuser deal is part of a recent trend that has seen homebuilders use acquisitions to gain quick entry into new markets.In July, Ryland Group (RYL) made its fourth acquisition in a year when it bought the operations and assets of Cornell Homes, a developer in Philadelphia, western New Jersey and Delaware.In September, Meritage Homes (MTH) announced its acquisition of Phillips Builders, a Nashville-based builder.Weyerhaeuser, a timberland owner that makes wood, container board and paper products, began exploring the idea of selling its homebuilding unit in June.In a statement at the time, Weyerhaeuser CEO Dan Fulton said that ""given the improving fundamentals of the housing market, we believe now is a prudent time to explore strategic alternatives for this business.""The Tri Pointe-Weyerhaeuser deal was structured as a tax-free Reverse Morris Trust, which allowed Tri Pointe to buy a larger firm while Weyerhaeuser shareholders would own the majority of shares.When the deal closes, Tri Pointe will have a chance to expand well beyond its current market, which mainly focuses on houses in California and Colorado that sell for $300,000 to $1.5 million.""We have accelerated our long-term plan to be a leading regional homebuilder in some of the nation's fastest-growing markets,"" Bauer said on the conference call. ""The combination of Wreco's local market knowledge and Tri Pointe's strong and established history of success should result in a powerful and focused homebuilding company.""Prices And Revenue GrowingHe made those comments following Tri Pointe's third-quarter earnings release. The company posted earnings of 15 cents a share, topping estimates for 9 cents. Revenue rose more than 480% year over year to $58.5 million, above views for $44.9 million.The average selling price of homes delivered climbed 57% to $624,000 as Tri Pointe benefited from the opening of three communities in Southern California.New home orders nearly doubled to 135 from 74 a year earlier, while homebuilding gross margins improved to 23% from 11.7% the prior year.Tri Pointe said it will have nine active communities by the end of 2013. It expects to open 20 to 24 new communities in 2014, excluding the Wreco assets.""We project that Tri Pointe will sell all of the remaining homes in a few of the nine communities that are open, resulting in an active community count of 27 at year-end 2014,"" analyst Lynch noted.Analysts expect Tri Pointe to post full-year EPS of 47 cents in 2013 and $1.09 in 2014.

1788,DHI,"Lennar Corporation’s (LEN  -  Free Report) shares have been rallying since the second-quarter fiscal 2018 release on Jun 26, 2018. In fact, the nation’s largest homebuilder has outperformed the homebuilding industry so far this year. Although Lennar deteriorated 17% year to date, it fared better than the broader industry’s 19.7% decline.Recently, Lennar posted stellar second-quarter results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Notably, second-quarter fiscal 2018 was the first full quarter with CalAtlantic. Its top and bottom lines grew considerably, primarily on higher orders, along with improved gross margins and SG&A expenses. Revenues grew 67% as the Homebuilding (up 75.5%), Financial Services and Multifamily segments performed significantly well. Lennar witnessed robust market improvement, aided by 57% increase in deliveries and 62% rise in new home orders (up 79% in dollars).U.S. homebuilding was quite a rage in 2017, giving investors ample scope to rake in handsome gains. The industry is equally attractive this year, courtesy of solid economic growth and job market. Consistent job growth, growing interest from first-time homebuyers as well as high homebuilders’ confidence are the main factors driving the momentum.Lennar is one such company that continues to display strength in several areas. Hence, adding the stock to your portfolio should not be a disappointment. Earnings estimates for Lennar have exhibited an uptrend, reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2018 and 2019 earnings has also been revised upward by 12.2% and 2.5%, respectively, over the past seven days. Let’s delve deeper into the other factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock a profitable pick. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. What Makes Lennar a Solid Pick?Solid Growth Prospects: Presently, the problem of adequate supply of land is taking its worst shape, as demand continues to scale up in the homebuilding industry. Given significant pent-up housing demand, Lennar has secured a decent backlog. In the quarter under review, backlog grew 92% from the year-ago quarter to 19,622 homes. Potential housing revenues from backlog increased 114% year over year to $8.6 billion.Meanwhile, rising land and labor costs are threatening margins of major homebuilders. In this respect, the company has managed to control costs prudently, as is evident from gross margin expansion. The company’s home sales gross margin expanded 10 basis points in the fiscal second quarter.Lennar has solid growth prospects, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings of $5.24 per share, which is expected to grow 37.5% year over year. Meanwhile, the company’s sales are expected to increase by a stellar 64.9% in fiscal 2018. Overall, Lennar constitutes a great pick in terms of growth investment, supported by a Growth Score of B.Leading Homebuilder: Lennar is considered as one of the leading homebuilders in the United States. The company offers a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers.The acquisition of CalAtlantic Group Inc. in February 2018 made Lennar one of the country’s top three homebuilders in 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets. Lennar remains confident that the company will exceed its prior $100 million synergy-savings expectations for 2018 and is on track to meet $365 million synergies for 2019 as well. The latest earnings result also speaks of the synergies that the company is experiencing.Valuation Looks Rational: Because of homebuilders’ asset-driven nature, it makes sense to value them based on the price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.3. This is lower compared with the current P/B for the industry and S&P 500 that are pegged at 1.4 and 3.9, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning indicates that there is room for an upside in the quarters ahead, substantiating its Value Score of B.Solid VGM Score: The company has an impressive VGM Score of B. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 make solid investment choices.Superior ROE: Lennar’s return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Its ROE of 14.2% compares favorably with the industry’s average of 112.4%, implying that it is efficient in using its shareholders’ funds.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report), Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report).M.D.C. Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 and its earnings for the current year are likely to increase 32.6%.Beazer Homes, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, is expected to witness 6.5% earnings growth for the year.D.R. Horton also carries a Zacks Rank #2 and its fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to grow 35.4%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

1789,DHI,"Strong housing demand and lack of competition in the luxury new home market are favoring Toll Brothers Inc (TOL  -  Free Report). Overall fundamentals of the housing market were strong in 2017 and are expected to improve further in the rest of 2018. Steady job and wage growth, recovering economy, moderate home price gains, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory indicate consistent strong demand through 2018.Again, less competition in the luxury new home market is beneficial for Toll Brothers. The company mostly caters to luxury move up buyers, who own a residence and are planning to shift to larger homes. These homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes. Thus, the company enjoys an edge over other homebuilding companies, resulting in increased home deliveries, earnings and revenue backlog growth.In fiscal 2017, total revenues of $5.82 billion rose 12% and deliveries of 7,151 units increased 17% from the prior-year period. The company delivered double-digit growth in earnings, revenues, contracts and backlog in fiscal 2017. The trend continued in the first six months of fiscal 2018, with the company registering double-digit growth in revenues (up 21%), contracts (up 25% in dollars) and backlog (up 27% in value). This reflects the health of the luxury new home market.Moreover, considering the pent-up housing demand, the company secured some of the most sought-after urban locations in the country, where land is scarce and approvals are not easy to obtain. The company’s solid land position places it well to cater to growing demand in these regions and provide it a competitive edge over peers who are facing land-availability constraints.ConstraintsRising building materials and labor costs are growing concerns for the company’s margin. Land prices are inflating due to limited availability. This can dent homebuilders’ margins in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, the recently imposed tariff on imported steel and aluminum raises concern. An increase in import tariff will escalate raw material cost for home builders, who are already grappling with higher cost, thanks to the recent imposition of lumber tariff.Again, a shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor is exerting pressure on the margins of Toll Brothers and other homebuilders like PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report). In fact, the company’s adjusted gross margin declined 80 basis points in fiscal 2017 and 180 basis points in the last quarter.Notably, shares of the company have lost 5.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.8% rally.Bottom LineUnhindered by the persistent issues, analysts are optimistic about Toll Brothers. Earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have moved up 3 cents for 2018 and 11 cents for 2019 over the past 60 days. This indicates analysts’ optimism surrounding the company’s future earnings potential.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1790,DHI,"Prudent land-acquisition strategies, diverse buyer group and solid housing industry fundamentals bode well for PulteGroup Inc (PHM  -  Free Report). The company’s last quarterly earnings surged 111% on a year-over-year basis on the back of higher demand, courtesy of favorable U.S. housing market.However, shares of the company have lost 10.9% so far this year. But that’s not a reason to get rid of PulteGroup now. The homebuilding industry has declined 18.7% year to date, thanks to elevated raw material costs and interest rates. Moreover, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry in the past year, rising 23.3%.Let’s delve into other factors which make us reasonably confident about this stock.Land Acquisition Strategy to Boost ProfitabilityPulteGroup’s annual land-acquisition strategies have resulted in improved volumes, revenues and profitability for quite some time now. In 2017, the company spent $1.1 billion on land acquisition. Considering the healthy housing market fundamentals, PulteGroup expects land-acquisition spend to grow approximately 10% in 2018.The company projects higher returns on invested capital on the back of plans to moderate the rate of land spend, increase the use of possible land options and accelerate inventory turns. The company is also maximizing the value of its land assets by selling houses at higher prices and better margins, thereby using the strong cash flow to invest in the business, pay off debt and systematically return to shareholders. Valuation Looks RationalPulteGroup has a Value Style Score of B, putting it in the top 40% of all the stocks we cover from this perspective. This, combined with a good earnings growth prospects, makes us reasonably confident. Though the company is currently trading at a discount, it has ample opportunities in the near future. In 2018, earnings are expected to grow a solid 51.1%.The company currently has a P/E ratio of 11.8 which is well below the high scaled over the past five years (20.4). This indicates a good entry point. Moreover, the company currently has a forward P/E ratio (price compared with this year’s earnings) of 8.9 suggesting that a more value-oriented path lies ahead of PulteGroup in the near future.Positive Housing Market OutlookOverall fundamentals of the housing market were positive through 2017 and are expected to improve further in 2018. Meanwhile, steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory point at strong demand in 2018.Improving labor markets, falling unemployment rates and a limited home supply are supporting a consistent rise in home prices, which are expected to boost the top line of homebuilders like PulteGroup, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton Inc (DHI  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report). Notably, PulteGroup’s revenues for 2018 are expected to increase 15.4% year over year.Bottom LineUnhindered by the persistent issues, analysts are optimistic about PulteGroup. Earnings estimates have moved north 6.4% for 2018 and 5.4% for 2019 over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism surrounding the company’s future earnings potential. The company’s prudent land investments and strategic initiatives should drive the stock in the upcoming quarters.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1791,DHI,"The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped in June to the lowest level this year and below its six-month average of 70 as tariffs on lumber and other imported materials are coming in the way of buyers’ affordability, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.Shares of homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) fell 1.6%, 2.1%, 2.4% and 1.6%, respectively, on Monday. Apart from builders’ perception, looming trade war concerns after China's retaliation to U.S. tariffs pulled Wall Street down modestly yesterday.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming period, given the robust consumer demand.Key TakeawaysHomebuilder sentiment fell two points in June to 68 and all three indices — present sales, future sales and buyer traffic — declined one point. In the words of NAHB Chairman Randy Noel, a custom homebuilder from LaPlace, LA, ""builders are increasingly concerned that tariffs placed on Canadian lumber and other imported products are hurting housing affordability. Record-high lumber prices have added nearly $9,000 to the price of a new single-family home since January 2017.""Notably, all three Housing Market Index components fell one point in June. Current sales conditions decreased to 75. Buyer traffic decreased to 50 and sales prediction over the next six months slipped to 76.Meanwhile, challenges like inventory shortage are still prevailing in the U.S. real estate market and creating upward pressure on prices in several parts of the country, thereby affecting affordability. Additionally, mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields, in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed. Rising mortgage rates may dilute demand for new homes.Construction Prices Are SoaringApart from tariffs on lumber, the U.S. Government’s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has also stirred concerns among investors about the construction sector. According to an Associated Builders and Contractors (“ABC”) analysis of information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, May construction material prices increased 2.2% month over month, representing the largest monthly increase in 10 years (since May 2008). On a year-over-year basis, the price of construction materials increased 8.8%.ABC Chief Economist Anirban Basu is concerned about rapidly rising construction materials prices and stated that current solid economic expansion may eventually disappear as inflationary pressures become increasingly apparent. He added that real estate and construction cycles are particularly vulnerable to increases in borrowing costs.Myriad problems have been decelerating the homebuilding industry of late, as evident from the 17.1% year-to-date decline against a 4.1% rise of the S&P 500 Composite. Even big names like Lennar, D.R. Horton, PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home and NVR Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) have plunged 17.9%, 17.9%, 10.9%, 19.6% and 11.5%, respectively, so far this year.Robust Demand Raises HopeDespite June’s drop, NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz remains optimistic about the industry given solid housing demand (mainly for single-family construction), improved economic growth and continued job creation.Regionally, on a three-month moving average, builder sentiment in the Northeast rose 2 points to 57, while the West and Midwest remained unchanged at 76 and 65, respectively. Sentiment in the South fell 1 point to 71.It is to be noted that any reading above 50 indicates that more builders expect sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has remained above 60 since September 2016. Growth is expected to accelerate in the coming period as the industry starts to feel the impact of bigger after-tax paychecks along with a strong job market.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1792,DHI,"D.R. Horton Inc.’s (DHI  -  Free Report) shares have returned 26.6% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 8.9% growth. Earnings estimates for the current and next year moved north in the past 60 days by 3.9% and 2.3%, respectively. This signifies that analysts are optimistic of the company’s future earnings growth, despite much apprehension about the impact of a rising interest rate scenario.In the last reported quarter, D.R. Horton delivered yet another solid performance. Earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, courtesy of a solid housing market scenario. Homebuilding revenues increased 16% year over year on a 15% rise in home closings in the quarter. New orders rose 13% in units as well as value, increasing across all the operating regions.Gross and pre-tax margins improved 100 basis points (bps) and 80 bps, respectively, in the quarter. The company reported earnings of 91 cents per share, higher than the year-ago profit level of 60 cents. Meanwhile, the company’s raised guidance on revenues, pre-tax margin and cash flow from operations for the year is equally encouraging. Growth DriversWith accretive acquisitions, robust backlog and cost-saving initiatives, D.R. Horton is expected to perform well in fiscal 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the current fiscal stands at $3.71 per share, which is expected to grow 35.4% year over year on 14.7% revenue growth.Acquisitions have been an important growth driver for the company. The $558-million buyout of 75% shares of Forestar Group will help D.R. Horton expand its operations in Texas, which is currently witnessing positive housing momentum. It is also expected to contribute around $1 billion in annual revenues over the next five years.This homebuilder’s quarter-end sales order backlog (under contract) increased 8.4% to 15,841 homes. Backlog value increased 9% to $4.8 billion. Meanwhile, the company has plans to boost investments for replenishing its land and lot supply in 2018 to support revenue growth. The company expects its homebuilding operations to invest approximately $4 billion in lots, land and development in fiscal 2018. This will surely give a major boost to its top line.Separately, management has been making consistent efforts to reduce both construction and selling, as well as general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. It controls construction costs by designing homes efficiently, and also obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, SG&A expenses improved 30 bps year over year to 9.1% and are expected to be around 8.7% for fiscal 2018.Proficient cost management is expected to give a boost to the company’s margins. For fiscal 2018, D.R. Horton expects consolidated pre-tax margin to improve 70-90 bps to 12.1-12.3%.The company believes that a consistent sales pace through inventory turnover is the best way to maximize profits and returns. In the trailing 12 months (as of Mar 31, 2018), D. R. Horton’s homebuilding return on inventory was 17.6%, depicting an improvement of 160 bps from 16% a year ago.HeadwindsRising material and labor costs, as well as competitive pricing pressure are major causes of concern.Moreover, recently, the Federal Reserve hiked funds rate for the second time this year by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75-2%. Chances of two more rate hikes this year are also high. The rate hike was imminent, given stable economic scenario backed by low unemployment and solid wage growth. That said, the rise in interest rates comes at a time when home prices are increasing, owing to supply constraints and increased raw material costs.Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields, in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed. Rising mortgage rates may dilute the demand for new homes.Though myriad problems have been decelerating the homebuilding industry of late, the larger picture is convincingly strong. Consumer demand is robust, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, D.R. Horton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors may consider some better-ranked stocks in the same space.M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report) sports a Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1793,DHI,"Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, sank more than expected in May 2018, marking the second consecutive monthly downfall. It seems that a flourishing economy is giving little boost to the traditional spring homebuying season as supply shortage, higher home prices and rising mortgage rates are somewhat creating hurdles for buyers.Key Takeaways: Tight Supply Continues to UpsetThe National Association of Realtors (“NAR”) said on Wednesday that existing home sales slipped 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.43 million units (5.53 million expected) last month from a downwardly revised 5.45 million in April.Existing home sales decreased 3% on a year-on-year basis in May. This is the third straight month of yearly declines.Regionally, sales were mixed. Sales in the Northeast rose 4.6%, but that was the only region to register an increase. In the Midwest,South and in the West, sales dipped 2.3%, 0.4%, and 0.8%, respectively.Sales grew in the Northeast, which accounts for a small fraction of the market, but it dropped in the West, South and Midwest.Meanwhile, May’s median sales price grew 4.9% from the comparable period a year ago to an all-time high $264,800, marking the 75th straight month of year-over-year gains.Again, inventory continued to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 6.1% from the year-ago period. However, housing inventory increased 2.8% from April. It would take just 4.1 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR.Current Mortgage Rates & ViewsAccording to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage moved higher to their second highest level this year. It rose eight basis points to an average of 4.62% for the week ending Jun 14, 2018, following a decline for two straight weeks.Meanwhile, last week, the Federal Reserve hiked funds rate for the second time this year as expected by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Moreover, chances of two more rate hikes this year are high. Hence, mortgage rates are expected to surge further and dilute demand.Rising mortgage rates and high prices of homes from inventory squeeze are indeed creating hurdles for buyers (mostly first-time). In May, first-time buyers comprised 31% of sales, which is down from both a year ago and prior month level of 33%.That said, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, believes, “Incredibly low supply continues to be the primary impediment to more sales, but there’s no question the combination of higher prices and mortgage rates are pinching the budgets of prospective buyers, and ultimately keeping some from reaching the market.”He further added that a solid U.S. economy accompanied with a healthy labor market should help the housing market reap better gains going forward than what has been seen so far this year.Builder Confidence SlipsThough consumer demand is still robust, we cannot ignore the current headwinds that are restricting the industry. The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped in June to the lowest level this year and below its six-month average of 70 as tariffs on lumber and other imported materials are coming in the way of buyers’ affordability, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.Tariffs on Canadian lumber are pushing up the already high cost for wood, which are fueling prices higher of up to $9,000 for a new single-family home, according to the National Association of Homebuilders.In addition to the Trump administration's 20% tariff on imported Canadian lumber, imposed in January, the U.S. Government’s recent move of imposing tariff on imported steel and aluminum has also stirred concerns among investors about the construction sector. According to an Associated Builders and Contractors’ (“ABC”) analysis of information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, May construction material prices increased 2.2% month over month, representing the largest monthly increase in 10 years (since May 2008). On a year-over-year basis, the price of construction materials increased 8.8%.Our TakeInnumerable problems have been slowing down the homebuilding industry , as evident from the 18.7% year-to-date decline against a 3.7% rise of the S&P 500 Composite. Even big names like Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and NVR Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) have plunged 17.4%, 17.4%, 11.7%, 17.5% and 11.6%, respectively, so far this year.Though homebuilders admit to rising labor shortage and land/labor costs, they remain optimistic about a measured recovery this year in tandem with steady economic growth. The housing industry is cyclical and affected by consumer confidence levels, prevailing economic conditions and interest rates. Although rising interest and mortgage rates, land and labor shortages, and rising material prices raise concerns, the 2018 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market, and a lower tax rate.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1794,DHI,"Sales of new homes in the United States dropped in April after gaining in March. In fact, new home sales faltered in three of the last four months this year, suggesting the travails of the housing market in winning back momentum. Housing starts and building permits also fell 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively, in the month.Sales of newly constructed single-family homes, accounting roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, dropped 1.5% in April from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662,000 units, per data released on May 23 by the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, sales data for the prior three months was also revised down. The revisions revealed that sales in the first three months of the year were not as strong as earlier reported.April’s figure was curtailed by a sharp decline in the West that sank 7.9%. On the contrary, sales rose 0.3% in the South, which accounts for the majority of new home sales. Again, sales jumped 11.1% in the Northeast and were unchanged in the Midwest month over month.On a positive note, new home sales were up 11.6% year over year, despite the month-to-month irregularity. This was driven by a 26.4% improvement in the Midwest, 18.9% in the West, 6% in the South and 5.3% in the Northeast.Again, although April starts and permits tumbled from the March figure, housing starts were up 10.5% from April 2017 buoyed by a 7.2% increase in single-family homes, and a 19.1% surge in apartments. Again, permits were 7.7% above the April 2017 rate of 1.26 million units prompted by a 7.9% surge in single-family homes and 6.4% growth in buildings with five units or more.  Is Tight Inventory or Rising Mortgage Rate the Culprit?The U.S. housing industry is already challenged by a shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. That said, there were 300,000 new homes on the market in April, the highest in nine years and up 0.7% from March and 12.4% from a year ago. This is expected to bring some relief in the beginning of the spring selling season. At April’s sales pace, it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, slightly up from 5.3 months in March.Limited land availability is pushing up prices, as the median sales price of a new home rose 0.4% year over year to $ 312,400 last month.Again, higher mortgage rates could also be the reason for this downfall. Mortgage rates, which loosely follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury, started the year at around 4% but began rising thereafter. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose to an average interest rate of 4.61% for the week ended May 17, 2018, the highest level since May 2011, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Higher mortgage rates accompanied with higher home prices might be hitting on affordability.Separately, according to the latest Mortgage Bankers Association's (“MBA”) seasonally adjusted weekly survey for the week ending May 18, 2018, total mortgage applications fell by 2.6% from a week earlier. Purchase applications for new loans fell 2% from the previous week, while refinance applications plunged 4%, the MBA reported. The refinance index is currently at its lowest level since December 2000.Fed Sees Next Hike SoonMinutes from the meeting, which ended May 2 and were released on May 23, reveal that Fed officials are on track to raise rates again in June. Officials at the Federal Open Market Committee concluded the May 2 meeting with a unanimous decision to keep the Fed’s benchmark interest rate unchanged, at the range of 1.5% to 1.75%. The Fed last raised interest rates in March, by a quarter of a percentage point.The rise in interest rates comes at a time when values of homes are marching up with higher demand and lesser supply. The situation could be detrimental for first-time buyers, raising affordability issues. This is evident from the latest report of purchase applications for new loans that fell 2% from the earlier week.Importantly, some of the notable stocks in the homebuilding sector have been slumping. Shares of Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) have declined 18.2% since the start of the year, while D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is down 18.6%. Meanwhile, shares of luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) have dipped 16.9% this year, while KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) stock is down 17.8%. In comparison, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has slipped 19.5% so far this year.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1795,DHI,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) debuted on 10/26/2005, and offers broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?For a long time now, the ETF industry has been flooded with products based on market capitalization weighted indexes, which are designed to represent the broader market or a particular market segment.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares. It has amassed assets over $289.70 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. Before fees and expenses, PKB seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Building & Construction Intellidex Index.The index is comprised of stocks of U.S. building and construction companies. The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factorsn.Cost & Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Annual operating expenses for PKB are 0.63%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.19%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 43.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector; Industrials and Materials round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Pultegroup Inc (PHM  -  Free Report) accounts for about 5.52% of the fund's total assets, followed by Tractor Supply Co (TSCO  -  Free Report) and Dr Horton Inc (DHI  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 45.75% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -10.18%, and was up about 7.33% in the last one year (as of 05/22/2018). PKB has traded between $28.31 and $36.11 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 1.22 and standard deviation of 17.95% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high choice in the space. With about 30 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) tracks S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) tracks Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF has $890.20 M in assets, iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF has $1.57 B. XHB has an expense ratio of 0.35% and ITB charges 0.44%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Industrials ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1796,DHI,"With robust backlog, a well-stocked inventory of land, lots and homes in place and accretive acquisitions, D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) is expected to continue its stellar performance through fiscal 2018. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, sales order backlog increased 8.4% to 15,841 homes. Backlog value increased 9% to $4.8 billion.The company’s first-half performance was impressive with Homebuilding revenues increasing 15% and earnings rising 22.6%. Homes closed in the first six months of 2018 increased 15% to 23,069 homes compared with 20,089 homes closed in the same period of 2017.Key PositivesAcquisitions have been an important growth driver for the company. The $558-million buyout of 75% shares of Forestar Group will help D.R. Horton to expand operations in Texas, which is witnessing positive housing momentum. It is expected to contribute around $1 billion in annual revenues over the next five years.D.R. Horton’s inventory of land, plots and homes provide it a strong competitive position to meet rising demand in upcoming quarters. This is expected to boost sales and home closings. The company invested $3.5 billion in lots, land and development in fiscal 2017 compared with $2.7 billion a year ago. The company expects its homebuilding operations to invest approximately $4 billion in lots, land and development in fiscal 2018.Moreover, the company’s cost-reduction measures have lowered SG&A expenses over the years. It strategically manages the pricing, incentives and sales pace across its markets, which will optimize the returns on inventory investments. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, SG&A expenses improved 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 9.1% and are expected to be around 8.7% for fiscal 2018.Upbeat OutlookThe company raised consolidated revenue guidance in the range of $15.9-$16.3 billion from the prior expectation of $15.5-$16.3 billion. Homes closing are now expected to fall between 51,500 and 52,500 units (versus 50,500-52,500 units expected earlier). Homebuilding SG&A expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, are reaffirmed at around 8.7%.D.R. Horton has updated home sales gross margin forecast to 20.5-21%. Consolidated pre-tax profit margin is now expected to be approximately 12.1-12.3% (compared with 11.8-12% expected earlier).Major HurdlesRising building materials and labor costs are headwinds for the company’s margin. Land prices are inflating due to limited availability. This could eat into homebuilders’ margins in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, the recently imposed tariff on imported steel and aluminum raises concern. An increase in import tariff will escalate raw material cost for home builders, who are already grappling with hiked cost, thanks to the recent imposition of lumber tariff. Home sales gross margin contracted 20 bps to 20% in fiscal 2017.Again, high mortgage rates may dilute the demand for new homes. In March, the Federal Reserve raised federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point. The target range for benchmark short-term interest rate is pegged between 1.5% and 1.75%. This was the sixth rate hike by the Fed since 2015. The Fed expects to increase interest rates two more times in 2018 and projects a median federal funds rate of 2.9% by the end of 2019 that indicates three hikes against the two estimated in the last Fed meeting in December 2017.D.R.

1797,DHI,"Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 22, before the opening bell. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the last reported quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 15.17% in the trailing four quarters.Toll Brothers mostly caters to the luxury move-up buyers, who already possess a residence and are looking to shift to larger homes. These homebuyers are less sensitive to price changes. Thus, it enjoys an edge over other homebuilding companies, thereby resulting in strong earnings, revenues, contracts and backlog growth. Notably, the lack of competition in the luxury new home market proves beneficial for Toll Brothers.Toll Brothers Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Toll Brothers Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Toll Brothers Inc. Quote Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementThe 2018 outlook for the U.S. homebuilding industry is quite compelling, given the affordable interest rates and tight inventory, indicating pent-up demand. The company’s first quarter of fiscal 2018 marked the 14th consecutive period of year-over-year growth in contract dollars and units, with 20% or more growth recorded in the last few quarters.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects home deliveries between 1,825 and 1,925 units, at an average price of $825,000-$850,000. This compares with the year-ago level of 1,638 units. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for home deliveries stands at 1,886 units, implying 32.5% sequential and 15.1% year-over-year growth.Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for average selling price of $838 million indicates an increase from $826 million in the prior quarter and $832 million a year ago.Now, for the company’s gross margin, Toll Brothers expects adjusted gross margin to be approximately 22.8%, implying a decline of 90 basis points (bps) sequentially and 150 bps year over year.The shortage of buildable lots is limiting home production, thereby lowering the inventory of homes, both new and existing. Additionally, rising building materials and labor costs are growing concerns for the company’s margins. Land prices are inflating due to limited availability. The rising labor and material costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) among others.The company expects SG&A expenses at approximately 10.6% of the revenues. This compares favorably with the year-ago figure of 10.8% and 13.4% in the preceding quarter.Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $1.57 billion, implying 14.8% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at 75 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 2.7% year over year.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Toll Brothers is likely to beat on earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Toll Brothers has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 75 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Toll Brothers has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1799,DHI,"U.S. retail sales picked up in March after declining for three straight months, as consumers bought more motor vehicles and other expensive items, reflecting a revival in consumer spending owing to tax cuts and refunds. Eight of 13 major retail categories showed improvement.Into the HeadlinesOverall retail sales increased 0.6% in March, after 0.1% drop in each of the previous three months. Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, core retail sales ticked up 0.4% in March after remaining unchanged in February. Core retail sales are most closely aligned with the consumer spending component of GDP (read: 3 ETFs to Better Prepare for Aggressive Rate Hikes).Consumer spending accounts for over two-thirds of the U.S. GDP, which seems to have slowed in 2018. It grew 4.0% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 but tepid wage growth in February might have dented purchasing power. However, given the recent positive numbers, analysts believe the U.S. economy is entering the second quarter with great momentum, after a harsh winter marred purchasing power for big-ticket items at the beginning of 2018.In March, auto sales rose 2.0% after a 1.3% drop in February. Moreover, sales at furniture stores increased 0.7% while electronics and appliances stores witnessed an increase of 0.5%. However, sales at building material stores declined 0.6% in the month while receipts at clothing stores fell 0.8%. Moreover, gas station sales dropped 0.3% in the month, the steepest since July.Let us now discuss a broad ETF providing exposure to the retail space.SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report)This fund focuses on providing exposure to the U.S. retail industry that looks to benefit from improved consumer sentiment.

1800,DHI,"As expected, the Federal Reserve hiked funds rate for the second time this year by a quarter percentage point to a range of 1.75% to 2%. Moreover, chances of two more rate hikes this year are high. The rate hike was imminent given the solid economic scenario backed by low unemployment and solid wage growth along with a rise in prices.The unemployment rate fell to an 18-year low in May to 3.8% from the previous month. For the first time since 2000, the number of job openings now exceeds the number of workers to fill in the positions. Fed expects the rate of unemployment rate to be 3.6% this year, down from 3.8% expected earlier.A tight labor market invariably leads to an increase in wages, with total wages up 2.7% in the last 12 months. Again, more income in the hands of individuals leads to increased demand for goods and services which in turn leads to higher prices. In the 12-month period through May, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was up 2.8%, its biggest year-on-year rise since early 2012. The core CPI measure, which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, rose 2.2% from May 2017. Fed expects inflation to rise 2.1% for this year through 2020.Therefore, to put a check on inflation, an interest hike was quite imperative. Though an increase in interest rates increases the cost of borrowing, Fed officials are confident that the economy won’t be affected by higher borrowing costs. The committee sees economic growth of 2.8% for 2018, highlighting an increase of 0.1 percentage point from the estimates issued in March 2018.Impact of Rising Rates on HomebuildersWith two more hikes expected this year along with three in 2019, investors in the housing space are jittery. Shares of prominent homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers (TOL  -  Free Report) lost around 4% while that of PulteGroup (PHM  -  Free Report) fell 6.7% and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) slipped about 7%.A hike in the benchmark Federal Funds’ target rate will probably lead to a rise in mortgage rates in the remainder of 2018 or thereafter. High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes, revenues and profits of homebuilders.Will This Lower Affordability?The rise in interest rates comes at a time when home prices are increasing owing to supply constraints and increased raw materials costs. Builders are spooked by higher aluminum and steel costs, thanks to the newly-imposed tariffs. This coupled with increased lumber prices owing to an import tariff is denting builders’ margins, prompting them to bump up prices. Further, troubles like labor shortage and limited land availability continue to make things difficult.Additionally, the rise in mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are taking baby steps into the housing market. Higher interest rates will only flare up such issues but will also delay home purchases by millennials.Total mortgage applications fell 1.5% in the week ending Jun 8 as is evident from the latest Mortgage Bankers Association report. Purchase applications for new loans fell 2% from the previous week, while refinance applications plunged 2%.Are Housing Stocks a Safe Shelter Now?Though myriad problems have been decelerating the homebuilding industry of late, as is evident from the 17.2% year-to-date decline against a 3.9% rise of the S&P 500 Composite, the larger picture is convincingly strong.Consumer demand is robust as is evident from the new home sales data that point to an 11.6% increase year over year in April despite the month-to-month irregularity. Housing starts were up 10.5% from April 2017 buoyed by a 7.2% increase in single-family homes and a 19.1% rise in apartments. Again, permits were 7.7% above the April 2017 level prompted by a 7.9% rise in single-family homes and 6.4% growth in buildings with five units or more. Also, builder confidence remained above 50 in the first five months of 2018, indicative of a favorable outlook.The solid momentum is expected to continue in the rest of 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and positive consumer confidence.Picking the Right StocksInvestors can consider four homebuilding stocks that are currently trading at a discount and have ample room to run.

1801,DHI,"Acuity Brands, Inc. (AYI  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.89 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11 by 10.4%.

The reported figure also increased 3.4% year over year.The upside was mainly attributable to more than a 6% increase in sales volume and a 1% favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.

1802,DHI,"Yesterday, at its policy meeting, the Fed went ahead with its highly anticipated move of hiking the interest rates by 25 basis points. While the policy makers were happy about a strong U.S. economy, the rate hike raised eyebrows in the housing market.  Shares of home builders — PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) — tanked 6.67% 4.01%, 4.32%, 4.25%, respectively, following the news release, on concerns that increasing interest rates might ruin the affordability of home buyers in the form of higher interest cost on home mortgages. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Fed Raises Interest RatesAgainst the backdrop of declining employment rates and faster-than-anticipated increase in interest rate beyond the 2% threshold level, the fed funds rate was pulled up for the second time this year.Moreover, the dot plot of the Fed the policy makers hinted at a step up in the pace of rate hike, with two more upward moves for the balance of the year compared with the previous plan of one more. The Fed also sees three rate hikes in 2019.Rising Interest Rate to Impact AffordabilityMortgage rate, which loosely follows the yield on the 10-year Treasury, started the year at around 4% but began rising thereafter. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion to U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Fed.There seems no respite for mortgage rates as the Fed continues with its aggressive policy moves. High mortgage rates dilute demand for new homes, as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers the purchasing power of buyers and hurts volumes, revenues and profits of homebuilders.The rise in interest rates looks all the more unwelcoming for the industry, which is already facing higher house demand and constrained supply.  This phenomenon might pinch first-time homebuyers the most.         Consequently, higher mortgage rates may impact affordability at a time when millennials are trying to make their dream come true of owing a house. Nevertheless, higher interest rates will only act as a dampener in this case.High Input Prices Pose Another ConcernHigh input prices, which include raw material, wages and land cost, have caused an escalation in the end prices of house and at the same time shrink margins of homebuilders.Median price of existing homes was higher for the sixth straight year in 2017. April median sales were up for the 74th consecutive year.This shows continued pain for both hombuilders as well as buyers.Already Soft SalesHome sales have not been really encouraging so far this year, which to a certain extent reflects the struggles of the industry. Per the most recent data for the month of April, sales of new U.S. single-family homes were down in three of the last four reported months.Sales of newly constructed single-family homes, accounting roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, dropped 1.5% sequentially in April, along with a downward revision in sales for three months prior to that.The Pending Home Sales Index, a forward-looking indicator based on contract signings, decreased 1.3% sequentially to 106.4 in April, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline. The index is also down 2.1% year over year.Housing starts and building permits also fell in two of the last four reported months.Year to date, the industry has fallen by 13.5% compared with the 4.3% growth in S&P 500 Composite.Bottom LineNevertheless, a strong U.S. economy and favorable employment picture should offset some of the weakness in the housing industry.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1803,DHI,"Sales of previously owned homes jumped in February, marking the first gain in the last three months. This means that more Americans are looking to buy homes despite rising prices and a limited availability of homes.Exchange traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry jumped on Wednesday, after the news release. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) gained 1.6% while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) increased 0.9%. Meanwhile, PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) was up 0.7%.Shares of prominent homebuilders such as Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) surged 3.7%, 2.9%, 2.1%, 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively, in the last session.Now, as the Federal Reserve (Fed) has adopted a more hawkish stance, do investors need to worry about the momentum of the U.S. housing market? The latest positive housing data undoubtedly reassures the industry’s strength courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages.February Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales increased 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units from 5.38 million in January. Sales increased 1.1% from the year-ago level. This surge in existing-home sales (accounting for 90% of the market) after declining sales in the last two months indicates that competition will heat up during the traditional spring home-buying season.Regionally, sales were mixed. Sales in the Northeast and Midwest plunged 12.3% and 2.4%, respectively. However, sales surged 11.4% in the West and increased 6.6% in the Midwest.Meanwhile, February’s median sales price grew 5.9% from the comparable period a year ago to $241,700, marking the 72nd straight month of year-over-year gains.Again, inventory continued to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 8.1% from the year-ago period. However, housing inventory increased 4.6% from January. It would take just 3.4 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR.Fed’s Hawkish Stance: A Boon or Bane for Housing?As expected, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% in its first policy meeting under the new chief Jerome Powell, on March 21. The central bank also indicated that there will be at least two more hikes for 2018, highlighting its rising confidence that tax cuts and government spending will boost the economy. Fed officials see a stronger U.S. economy and signaled a slightly faster pace of interest rate hikes in the coming years.Meanwhile, according to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage moved higher for the fifth straight month to 4.33% in February (highest since 4.34% in April 2014) from 4.03% in January.Rising mortgage rates and high prices of homes from inventory squeeze are indeed creating hurdles for buyers (mostly first-time buyers). In February, first-time buyers comprised 29% of sales, which is down from 31% a year ago but unchanged from the prior month. However, NAR holds a bullish stance stating that a solid U.S. economy accompanied with a healthy labor market will help the housing market reap solid gains.Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, pointed out, “Mortgage rates are at their highest level in nearly four years, at a time when home prices are still climbing at double the pace of wage growth.” He further added, “Homes for sale are going under contract a week faster than a year ago, which is quite remarkable given weakening affordability conditions and extremely tight supply. To fully satisfy demand, most markets right now need a substantial increase in new listings.”Latest homebuilders’ confidence reading for March was also solid at 70 fueled by growing consumer demand. In spite of shortage in inventory, robust demand from a solid economy and cheerful job market is keeping the industry alive. With these strong economic fundamentals in place, the overall homebuilding picture is pretty encouraging for 2018.Notably, following the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Fed now expects faster economic growth of 2.7% this year, up from the forecast of 2.5% in December. For 2019, GDP growth is now expected to be 2.4%, up from the previously projected 2.1%. The Fed now projects the unemployment rate to fall to 3.8% this year from the present rate of 4.1%, which is a positive for the housing industry.4 Homebuilding Stocks to Bet OnWe have zeroed in on four homebuilding stocks that are worth investing in with solid growth potential amid above-mentioned woes.Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH  -  Free Report) is one of the leading homebuilders in the United States.

The average home price was $407,300, up 11.3% sequentially, due to higher construction wages and rising construction prices.Home Builders GainApril’s slight monthly decline in new home sales was not much of a concern as it was taken as a slight correction. Shares of prominent homebuilders such as D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) escalated after the release. This reinforced the positive sentiment among homebuilders.Moreover, the recent data on builder confidence showed an increase by two points to 70 in May from a downward revision of 68 in April, reinstating optimism in the current housing market. Importantly, the reading was above the 50 mark, in the first five months of 2018, indicating a favorable outlook.Moreover, high demand and limited supply have pushed home prices above the levels last seen in early 2006. Also, new construction remains below historically normal levels, which is exerting an upward pressure on prices. Notably tight inventories and rising home prices should aid homebuilders.Housing demand should remain crisp from nationwide economic growth, underpinned by record low unemployment, growing wages and strong business and consumer confidence.Headwinds RemainNevertheless, builders continue to face headwinds relating to high wages, paucity of land, lack of buildable lots, and increasing lumber and other raw material prices. These factors might cause home prices to escalate. This can further harm housing demand as builders pass on the high cost to home buyers. Moreover, increasing mortgage rates might be another factor inhibiting buyers to stay away from the higher burden of interest on housing loan.However, these factors haven’t had a marked impact on the industry's performance, which has been maintaining a lead position for quite some time. The Zacks Homebuilding Industry's rank (top 10% among more than 250 industries) instills investors’ confidence in this space.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1808,DHI,"Shares of D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) have returned 31.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 19.8% rally. Estimates have moved north in the last 60 days for the current as well as for the next year by 1.1% and 5.8%, respectively. This indicates that analysts are optimistic about the company’s future earnings growth.D.R. Horton delivered stellar performance yet again in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, courtesy of a solid housing market. Homebuilding revenues increased 14% year over year on a 14% rise in homes closings. New orders rose 16% in units and 17% in value, improving across all operating regions. With accretive acquisitions, robust backlog and a well-stocked inventory of land, lots and homes in place, D.R. Horton is expected to maintain its performance in the rest of fiscal 2018.Growth DriversAcquisitions have been an important growth driver for the company. The $558-million buyout of 75% shares of Forestar Group will help D.R. Horton to expand operations in Texas, which is witnessing positive housing momentum. It is also expected to contribute around $1 billion in annual revenues over the next five years.D.R. Horton’s inventory of land, plots and homes provide it a strong competitive position to meet the demand in future quarters. This is expected to boost sales and home closings.The company invested $3.5 billion in lots, land and development in fiscal 2017 compared with $2.7 billion a year ago. The company plans to boost investments to replenish its land and lot supply in 2018 to support revenue growth.Moreover, the company’s cost-reduction measures reduced SG&A expenses over the years. It strategically manages the pricing, incentives and sales pace across its markets, which will optimize the returns on inventory investments. For fiscal 2017, the company’s SG&A expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, declined 40 bps to 8.9%. The company’s total return on inventory improved in the past few years. With 259,000 lots in inventory at the end of first quarter of fiscal 2018 (49% lots were owned and 51% were controlled through option contracts), D. R. Horton is well poised for fiscal 2018.Overall fundamentals of the housing market were strong in 2017 and are expected to improve in 2018. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, moderating home price gains, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory — all point to consistent strong demand in 2018.Upbeat Fiscal 2018 OutlookRevenues are expected in the range of $15.5-$16.3 billion for fiscal 2018. Homes closings are expected to fall between 50,500 and 52,500 units. Homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, are expected to be around 8.7%. D.R. Horton updated its home sales gross margin forecast to 20-21%, versus the previous projection of 20%. Consolidated pre-tax profit margin expected at approximately 11.8-12%, against the earlier expectation of 11.5-11.7%. Cash flow from operations is expected at around $700 million (excluding Forestar), up from the previous projection of $500 million.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the homebuilder’s earnings for fiscal 2018 are expected to increase a solid 30.7% and sales are likely to grow a healthy 14.8% year over year.It is important to note that rising material and labor costs as well as competitive pricing pressure are major causes of concern. Again, high mortgage rates may dilute the demand for new homes. However, such hurdles have not been able to affect the industry significantly till now.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderD.R.

1809,DHI,"Homebuilder stocks had a sensational run in 2016 and 2017. A strengthening economy, rosy employment picture and rock-bottom mortgage rates combined to create a fairy-tale environment for the companies that create the new homes Americans aspire to live in.  Thanks to low rates, it had never been easier to afford the home of your dreams.Then came 2018.  After bottoming near 3.5% in the summer of 2016, the rate on a 30-year conventional mortgage has been on a slow climb ever since and now stands at 4.4%. Expectations for 3 or 4 interest rate hikes this year put a real damper on the homebuilder party and predictably, investors took their gains and headed for the exits.Yield Curve FlattensAn interesting thing has happened, though.  Despite the fact that the Fed has been steadily raising short term rates for over a year – and new Fed Chief Jay Powell is signaling his intent to continue on this path - the longer-term rates have been stubborn to follow and the yield curve continues to flatten.  After a steep rise, mortgage rates (which are generally indexed off the 10-year bonds) have flattened of late and it’s time to take a look another look at the recently beleaguered homebuilder stocks. Two homebuilding stocks in particular show signs that the selloff has been overdone and are poised to flex their earnings muscle in the coming year.KB Home (KB) has seen its stock price tumble almost 25% from recent highs on concerns for the entire sector.  In that same period however, Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimates for 2018 have risen 25%, from $2.15 to $2.69, earning it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  KB homes has grown earnings steadily for the past two years and shows no sign of stopping.  The recent selloff makes it a great value.Beazer Homes (BZH  -  Free Report) specializes in energy efficient homes for first time and middle market buyers (a large and growing segment of the market) and has experienced the same steep selloff that has afflicted the sector. Thanks to a strong and steadily improving earnings outlook, it also earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1810,DHI,"This week we have several very important economic reports coming out.  These top tier reports will give us key data on future indicators regarding factory orders, inflation, retail sales, housing, and consumer sentiment.The biggest report is coming out Wednesday; the Consumer Price Index.  With the current inflation worries, and the implications of the Fed raising rates at a faster pace, this will be the most closely watched report this week.  The last report showed that wages grew by +2.9% which spooked the markets and caused the flash crash.  Current year over year expectations are for a slight dip from 2.1% to 2%. Any pullback will be viewed as a positive for the markets, but if we see an uptick it could cause the markets to fall once again.Also on Wednesday, the Retail Sales report will be released and this will tell us if the recent strength in the segment will continue.  Expectations are for +0.3% gain which would be the seventh consecutive month of a positive reading. A positive reading would help many retail companies like Dillard’s (DDS  -  Free Report), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report), Conn's Inc. (CONN  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) all of which currently hold a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating.The Retail report will also be tied to Friday's Consumer Sentiment announcement which is expected to remain elevated.  Source: Bloomberg.comAs you can see in the table above, consumer sentiment has been around a reading of 95 for over a year.  If consumer sentiment remains at or near its current levels it bodes well for the retail sector, as this report gauges consumer spending, and the overall attitude of the economy.  This week we will also see two regional manufacturing reports, the Phily Fed, and the Empire State.  These reports will give us the conditions in local regions, and will be an indicator for the more important ISM manufacturing index coming out on March 1st.  The recent readings have been very strong, and have shown positive momentum in production and new orders over the past several months. Currently, the regional reports are expected to show continued strong growth.  Lastly, we will also see two very important housing reports this week.  On Thursday the Housing Market Index will be released. This forward looking report has remained high for the past several months.Source: Bloomberg.comTwo closely watched parts of the report will indicate if the increasing interest rate trend will begin show any signs of having a negative impact on the index.  And if the uptick in mortgage rates is impacting housing affordability.This report coupled with Friday's Housing Starts data will be an important barometer for the housing sector and several other sub sectors that rely on new housing.Housing starts took a bit of a dip last month due to weather related issues as you can see in the chart below.Source: Bloomberg.comBut this month's data should be clean of weather related issues, and is currently expected to show a snap back to 1.23 million units, well above December's reading of 1.1 million units.  Also, housing permits are expected to remain high at 1.3 million. A combination of an uptick in both the housing market index, and housing starts will be beneficial for home builders like KB Homes (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp (LEN  -  Free Report), and D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 Buy rating.The data will also be a forward indicator for companies that depend on new homes who supply them with furniture, appliances, and other household needs. Companies that can benefit from positive housing data include, Restoration Hardware (RH  -  Free Report), At Home Group (HOME  -  Free Report), Beacon Roofing (BECN  -  Free Report), and Eloctorlux ELUX-B, all of which currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating. If these data points come in as expected, it will set an overall positive tone for the markets for the next several weeks.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1811,DHI,"Dycom Industries Inc. (DY  -  Free Report) has recently lowered its outlook for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jan 27) ahead of the release of results (scheduled on Feb 28). Shares were down about 15% at one point in pre-market trading following the news, reflecting investors’ disappointment with the lowered guidance.For the fiscal second quarter, the company expects to report adjusted earnings in the band of 9-12 cents per share, assuming revenues of about $655 million. This is comparable with prior projections of adjusted earnings per share in the range of 24-36 cents, on revenues within the $645-$675 million band.On a GAAP basis, it projects diluted earnings per share in the band of $1.20-$1.23, incorporating tax benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.The company lowered its guidance on account of reduction in number of available workdays due to adverse weather conditions, which had an adverse impact on productivity and margins during the quarter-end. Also, the company adjusted its fiscal-year end from the last Saturday in July to the last Saturday in January, resulting in the commencement of fiscal 2019 on Jan 28, 2018.Furthermore, Dycom provided guidance for fiscal 2019 and updated its outlook for first-quarter fiscal 2019. For the fiscal year, the company anticipates revenues to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50 billion, with diluted earnings per share within $5.22-$6.14. For first-quarter fiscal 2019, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band 63-78 cents, assuming revenues to lie between $720 million and $750 million.Our TakeDycom has had an impressive run over the past few quarters, with an earnings beat streak that has lasted for seven consecutive quarters.Going forward, we believe that favorable industry trends like surging demand for 1 Gigabyte deployments, huge investment in wireline networks and cable capacity projects are likely to bode well for the company. Meanwhile, the industry is witnessing a dramatically increasing network bandwidth with major industry participants deploying significant 1 gigabit wireline networks. In the past few quarters, the company has gained profitable market share, extended geographic reach as well as expanded program management network planning services, which have added to its growth.Moreover, the company anticipates engineering and construction activity to increase throughout this year. In fact, several large programs have already gained momentum and many new contracts commenced meaningful activity, thus propelling Dycom’s growth. Also, emerging wireless technologies are fuelling wireline investments growth and the company remains optimistic that a complimentary wireline investment cycle is round the corner. In the past three months, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 27.2%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 6.6%.Dycom also has a strong portfolio of customers like the telecom and wireless equipment biggies such as AT&T, Comcast, CenturyLink and Verizon, to name a few. In the first quarter fiscal 2018, about 74.9% of the company’s total revenues were derived from its top five customers. Moving ahead, we expect the company to further benefit from its collaboration with such renowned telecom operators. Moreover, the company’s strong financial position coupled with diligent operational execution allows it to undertake strategic initiatives for expanding market share.However, the U.S. telecommunications industry is facing intense pricing competition. Severe spectrum crunch, coupled with gradual Smartphone and tablet adoption, are compelling wireless operators to seek other options for raising revenues.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Potlatch Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report). While Potlatch Corporation sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), D.R.

1812,DHI,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, D.R. Horton, Inc. has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts D.R. Horton, Inc.’s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 14.7) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that D.R. Horton, Inc. has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 11.2, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for D.R. Horton, Inc.’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, D.R. Horton, Inc. has a P/S ratio of about 1.0. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, D.R. Horton, Inc. currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes DHI a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though D.R. Horton, Inc. might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of A. This gives DHI a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen 12 estimates go higher in the past sixty days and three lower, while the full year estimate has seen 15 upward and two downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 1.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 2.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and Consensus  D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and Consensus | D.R. Horton, Inc. QuoteEven though D.R. Horton, Inc. has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineD.R. Horton, Inc. is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (top 5% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite positive estimate revision activity, investors should wait for industry trends to turn around first.  When it does, this stock could be a compelling value pick.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1813,DHI,"Sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped for the second straight month in January and in four of the past six months. Does this give smoke signals of a downtrend in the housing market?Exchange-traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry dropped on Monday, after the news release. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) fell 0.7% while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) dropped 1%. Meanwhile, the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) was down 1.3%.Shares of major builders of the U.S. housing industry like D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) Beazer Homes USA Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) slipped following the news release on that day.Is Weather or Higher Mortgage Rates the Culprit?Sales of newly constructed homes, accounting of roughly 10% of all U.S. home sales, fell 7.8% in January from the prior month and 1% from the year-ago period to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units, as per data released on Feb 26 by the Commerce Department.Notably, last month’s figure is the lowest since August 2017, weighed down by sharp declines in the Northeast and South. Sales sank 33.3% in the Northeast and fell 14.2% in the South, which accounts for the majority of new home sales. Sales rose 1% in the West and 15.4% in the Midwest.The downside was probably due to cold weather, particularly in Southern states, rather than any economic factor. Otherwise, all regions would have experienced deterioration.Again, higher mortgage rates could also be the reason for this downfall. Mortgage rates are surging in proportion with U.S. government bond yields in anticipation of higher rates of inflation and further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to an average interest rate of 4.15% for the week ending Jan 25, 2018, the highest level since March 2017, according to mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.Again, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to an average of 4.40% for the week ending Feb 22, the highest level since April 2014, from 4.38% in the prior week. It has increased for seven straight weeks. Higher mortgage rates accompanied with the loss of homeowner tax breaks in certain expensive markets might be hitting on affordability.Apart from the recent weak new home sales report, last week’s report from the National Association of Realtors also showed dismal existing home sales. Existing home sales dropped 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million units last month. Existing home sales, which account for about 90% of U.S. home sales, tanked 4.8% on a year-on-year basis in January.Meanwhile, the industry has already been challenged by shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. Total housing inventory at the end of January rose 4.1% to 1.52 million existing homes available for sale, but is still 9.5% lower than a year ago and has fallen year over year for 32 consecutive months. That said, the inventory of new homes was up 15% from a year ago in January, which is expected to provide some relief as we head toward the spring selling season.Limited land availability is driving prices higher, as median sales price of a new home jumped 2.4% year over year last month. The median house price increased 5.8% for existing homes from a year ago and was the 71st consecutive month of year-on-year price gain.Adding to the woes, first-time buyers comprised 29% of sales in January, which is down from 32% in December 2017 and 33% a year ago.Will the Current Downfall Linger Through 2018?Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are restricting homebuilders to respond to growing demand.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming period. In spite of shortage in inventory, robust demand from a solid job market is keeping the industry alive. Americans filing for unemployment benefits plunged to a 45-year low for the week ending Feb 17, 2018, indicating strong job growth. Job additions grew at a solid pace in January, and the record low unemployment rate and strong wage growth show that the labor market is in good shape. Notably, wage growth hit the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Although home price increases have surpassed wage growth, which remained 2.9%, the optimism surrounding the U.S. housing market remains intact amid overall economic growth. Along with this, a better employment picture generally boosts housing activity and demand.Given this mixed scenario, we should keep an eye on how the housing sector responds to rising rates as we approach in Spring, which according to Fitch Ratings, is traditionally more upbeat than the rest of the year.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018? Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1814,DHI,"(0:30) - Massive Stock Market Correction(2:40) - What To Learn From The Late 1990's Bull Market(9:00) - Strategies For A Stock Market Sell Off(12:30) - Tracey's Top Picks: Are Stocks On Sale?(20:30) - Takeaways: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #118 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey actually went solo to discuss what investors should do during a stock market correction.It’s been 2 years since there was this sharp type of volatility in the stock market. Some investors who only started buying stocks in the last 18 months, have never seen a 10% stock market correction.3 Strategies Investors Can Take During Stock Market Corrections1.      Do nothing. If you’re a long-term investor, and not a trader, then a quick downturn isn’t going to matter much. Does anyone remember the week the Dow lost 6% in 2016? I didn’t think so.2.      Buy more stocks. You know what they say, “buy when there’s blood in the streets” and there has been some blood with this correction. Some stocks have gone on sale, perhaps there are some opportunities?3.      Sell and get out. If you’re having trouble sleeping at night or have other anxieties because of movements in the stock market, then you may need to re-examine your investments to determine if stocks are where you should be.But if you’re willing to jump in when others are jumping out, maybe you should take a look at some stocks that are on sale.Tracey did a quick look at Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) stocks, which hopefully means they have rising earnings estimates, and combined it with a share price that has sold off in the last week.These 6 stocks are hardly the entire list. This is just a start.But given that the correction has impacted every sector, these stocks represent a cross section of industries.6 Stocks That Have Gone on Sale1.      Lumber Liquidators (LL  -  Free Report) has fallen 15% year-to-date but it hasn’t reported earnings yet. Earnings are expected to rebound 162% in 2018 with revenues up 7.4%.2.      DR Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) is getting beat up on fears that rising mortgage rates will put a damper on the housing market. Shares are down 10% year-to-date. It trades with a forward P/E of only 12 even though earnings are expected to jump 30% in fiscal 2018.3.      JP Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) has given up a lot of its 2018 gains, which presents a buying opportunity. Thanks to tax reform and rising interest rates, it’s expected to grow earnings by 29% in 2018. Yet it only trades with a forward P/E of just 12.3.4.      H&E Equipment Services (HEES  -  Free Report) hasn’t reported earnings yet, but the equipment rental business should be strong in 2018 with the economy booming. Shares are down 6.3% year-to-date.5.      EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) is one of the larger exploration and production companies. It hasn’t reported earnings yet but analysts think there will be earnings growth of over 250% in 2018 as crude prices appear poised to remain over $60. If you didn’t get in last year, perhaps the recent pullback in energy stocks is your opportunity?6.      Micron (MU  -  Free Report) has been cheap for a year but shares have weakened on fears that business would slow in the second half of the year. But it surprised the Street by raising second quarter revenue and EPS guidance as the memory chip pricing environment remained robust. Micron is trading at just 4x earnings and remains down 3% year-to-date.There are plenty of other stocks also on sale in this correction.Now’s the time to check out the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list of 233 #1 Rank stocks.What else should you know about investing during a stock market correction?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1815,DHI,"Premium technical services company Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017) results before the market opens on Feb 7.Notably, Jacobs delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 9.65%, in the last four quarters. Notably, the company’s earnings in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 came in at 98 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at Play Elevated infrastructure spending in the United States and recovering economic conditions in China (a major industrial end-market) are anticipated to boost demand for Jacobs’ premium engineering and construction management services. The $4.6-billion contract win from the Missile Defense Agency (August 2017), contract wins for the U.S. government’s national priority programs and the Blue Canopy acquisition (August 2017) are anticipated to bolster revenues of Jacobs’ Aerospace & Technology line of business (LOB). On the other hand, new investments made in targeted sectors (like social infrastructure, water and transportation), elevated demand from the Asia Pacific, Americas and European end-markets, and the latest transportation contract wins are expected to strengthen the top-line performance of Jacobs’ Buildings & Infrastructure LOB. Revenues of Industrial LOB will likely improve on the back of the recovering mining & minerals business, robust life-science business and sturdy field services sales in the United States.Strong top-line performance of the aforementioned segments, greater cost management, ongoing restructuring moves and timely project delivery are expected to reinforce the company’s bottom-line performance.However, Jacobs believes its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter might dip sequentially (excluding the impact of the CH2M buyout in December 2017). The company expects that the challenging energy market conditions might continue to hurt the near-term revenues of its Petroleum & Chemicals LOB.We also fear that other headwinds such as intense industry rivalry or adverse foreign currency-translation impact might weigh over Jacobs’ top- and bottom-line performances in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Jacobs is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Jacobs currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents comes in line with the Most Accurate Estimate.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Jacobs carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 but an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to Consider Here are some stocks within the Zacks Categorized Construction Sectorthat you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Boise Cascade, L.L.C.

But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1816,DHI,"When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits, one should explore another time-tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks. Translated, one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time.At the core, momentum investing is buying high, selling higher. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift. Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does the momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works. For instance, there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in the prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is thus based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period of time and across markets. So obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which would reflect some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks that have appreciated the maximum over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the eight stocks that made it through this screen:Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), which operates as a retailer of technology products, services, and solutions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, has gained an impressive 59.3% over the past year.

1817,DHI,"Lennox International Inc.(LII  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 6, before the market opens.The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 7.56% over the preceding four quarters. Notably, Lennox International’s adjusted earnings per share in third-quarter 2017 came in at $2.53 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at Play Lennox International believes its research and development projects as well as new marketing programs will continue to boost its segmental revenues. Moreover, the company noted that new investments made to widen its distribution footprint will help drive aggregate top-line results in the fourth quarter. In addition, the company predicts that favorable foreign exchange rates will bolster its revenues for full-year 2017 by nearly $5 million.  Based on such optimistic views, Lennox International raised the lower-end of its revenue growth guidance for 2017 from 4-7% to 5-7%.We believe improving replacement, new constructions and equipment sales will continue to drive Lennox International’s revenues. Notably, we notice that the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the company’s Commercial Heating & Cooling and Residential Heating & Cooling segment revenues are currently pegged at $246 million and $487, respectively, for fourth-quarter 2017, higher than the corresponding tallies of $243 million and $476 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Lennox International also anticipates that higher volume, favorable prices, reduced sourcing and engineering-led costs, and favorable foreign exchange impact will help widen its margins. The company expects to secure $35 million savings from lower sourcing and engineering-led costs in 2017. Also, it predicts generating $6-million savings from the Mexican manufacturing operations.However, Lennox International noted that elevated commodity costs, unfavorable mix and expenses related to the ongoing research and development, as well as retailing and distribution expansion moves might impede its margins in the quarter to be reported. Notably, the company has lowered its adjusted earnings guidance for 2017 to the $7.75-$8.05 per share range from the previously estimated guidance of $7.75-$8.15. We fear that continued productivity issues within several major facilities might also dent the company’s near-term profitability.Lennox International carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings is pegged at $1.67 for the quarter under review.Stocks to Consider Our proven model predicts that the three stocks zeroed down below from the Zacks Categorized Construction Sector will likely report a positive surprise in the fourth quarter.

1818,DHI,"Since we have entered the Q4 reporting cycle, looking for stocks with unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for astute investors. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Shape Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost controls. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while taking investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.As the earnings season picks up pace, investors should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to invest in stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank equal to 1 (Only Zacks' 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.) You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history.)% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (Companies that witnessed year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal.)% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,818 stocks to only 31.Here are the top five stocks:Best Buy Co. (BBY  -  Free Report) operates as a retailer of technology products, services, and solutions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The company’s estimated growth rate for this year is 13.5%, higher than the industry’s gain of 2.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 0.5% in the last 60 days.AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) discovers, develops, manufactures and sells pharmaceutical products worldwide. The company’s estimated growth rate for this year is 31.9%, higher than the industry’s gain of 9.1%.

1819,DHI,"Builder confidence increased two points to 70 in May from a downward revision of 68 in April, reinstating builders’ confidence in the current housing market. Importantly, the reading was above the 50 mark, in the first five months of 2018, indicating a favorable outlook. Moreover, this is the fourth time in 2018 that the index has reached 70.The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) includes builder perceptions of current single-family home sales, sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers. Notably, current single-family home sales increased two points in May but the indices measuring buyer traffic and sales expectations in the next six months were unchanged at 51 and 77, respectively.Consumer Demand Boosts Confidence“The solid May report shows that builders are buoyed by growing consumer demand for single-family homes,” said NAHB Chairman Randy Noel. Solid economic growth and low unemployment levels substantiate the growing consumer demand for homes.Although U.S. economic growth slowed in the first quarter to an annualized pace of 2.3% after averaging higher than 3% in the previous three quarters, the economy is likely to rebound in the coming quarters as the labor market is near full employment and business as well as consumer confidence is strong. The unemployment rate declined from 4.1% in March to 3.9% in April, the lowest level in nearly 18 years.The positive momentum is expected to continue through 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels and a tight supply situation.Higher Raw Material Cost HurtsIncreased lumber prices are denting builders’ earnings growth. In 2017, tariff was imposed on lumber, another major input material in the construction industry. The tariff imposed in retaliation to Canada's restrictions on the import of U.S. dairy products, averaged 20.83% on Canadian lumber imports, which are used mostly for home building in the United States.Builders are concerned about growing labor shortage and limited land availability that are hurting margins of homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R.

1821,DHI,"The PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report) made its debut on 10/26/2005, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Industrials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares. It has amassed assets over $283.87 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Industrials ETFs. PKB, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Dynamic Building & Construction Intellidex Index.The index is comprised of stocks of U.S. building and construction companies. The Index is designed to provide capital appreciation by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factorsn.Cost & Other ExpensesWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor. And, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins in the long term if all other factors remain equal.With on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.63%.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.20%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.PKB's heaviest allocation is in the Consumer Discretionary sector, which is about 42.20% of the portfolio. Its Industrials and Materials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Lennar Corp (LEN  -  Free Report) accounts for about 5.25% of total assets, followed by Dr Horton Inc (DHI  -  Free Report) and Pultegroup Inc (PHM  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 46.3% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has lost about -12.46%, and was up about 2.77% in the last one year (as of 04/25/2018). PKB has traded between $28.31 and $36.11 in the past 52-week period.PKB has a beta of 1.20 and standard deviation of 17.94% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a high choice in the space. With about 30 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesPowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) tracks S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index and the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report) tracks Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF has $844.56 M in assets, iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF has $1.54 B. XHB has an expense ratio of 0.35% and ITB charges 0.44%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Industrials ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1822,DHI,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the homebuilder delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.31%. The company surpassed/met the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 5.83%.Like other homebuilders, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory point toward strong demand in 2018.Resultantly, shares of D.R. Horton, one of the top builders in the United States, have increased more than 32% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 17.9% rally.D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | D.R. Horton, Inc. QuoteLet’s See How Things are Shaping Up for This AnnouncementWith an impressive sales backlog, along with a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, D.R. Horton is well positioned for 2018. The company expects its backlog conversion rate for the second quarter to be in the range of 97-100%.The company’s homebuilding revenues increased 14% year over year in the preceding quarter. For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues (comprising about 98% of total revenues) of $3,695 million indicates an increase from $3,252 million in the last quarter and $3,164 million in the year-ago period.Net sales orders increased 16% to 10,753 homes on continued improvement in the preceding quarter. For the upcoming release, the consensus estimate for net sales orders of 15,779 units reflects an increase from 13,991 units a year ago and 10,753 units in the prior quarter.Last quarter, home closings increased 15% to 10,788 homes, while growing 14% to $3.2 billion in value. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, home closings are estimated to be 12,089 units compared with 10,685 units a year ago.On the other hand, the consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $93 million indicates an increase from $81 million in the prior quarter and $87 million a year ago.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $3.75 billion, implying 15.3% year-over-year growth.Apart from solid revenues, D.R. Horton expects home sales gross margin to be around 20-21%, compared with 19.8% in the year-ago quarter. In the preceding quarter, the company’s gross margin on home sales expanded 100 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.8%. The upside was driven by lower warranty, litigation and interest costs as a percentage of homebuilding revenues.However, investors should note that the company’s home sales gross margin decreased 20 bps to 20% in fiscal 2017. Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.Meanwhile, for SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, the company expects it to be in the range of 9-9.2%. This compares favorably with the year-ago level of 9.3%.Overall, D.R. Horton remains well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario.  For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 86 cents per share, reflecting a solid increase of 43.3% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:D.R. Horton has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: D.R. Horton has an Earnings ESP of +3.67%.Zacks Rank: D.R.

1823,DHI,"Sales of previously owned homes increased in February 2018, despite low inventory and higher prices. The data came in as a breather after the last two month disappointed in terms of existing home sales.Exchange traded funds or ETFs that track the homebuilding industry gained on Wednesday, after the news release. iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB) gained 1.6% while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) was up 1.07%.Shares of prominent homebuilders such as D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) escalated yesterday after the release.February Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales, which account for about 90% of U.S. home sales, increased 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units from 5.38 million in January. It came in above the consensus estimate of 5.42 million. The same fell by 3.2% and 3.6% in January 2018 and December 2017, respectively.Also, sales were up 1.1% from the year-ago level, reversing the 4.8% year-over-year decline in January.The data showed uneven sales across regions. Sales in Northeast and Midwest, which continued to reel under cold weather, were down 12.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Sales were up respectively 11.4% and 6.6% in West and South. March winter storms are expected to disrupt home sales in the Northeast in the coming months.Also, February’s median sales price grew 5.9% from the comparable period a year ago to $241,700, marking the 72nd straight month of year-over-year increase. The price rise has to some extent restricted first-time buyers to enter the market as they comprised 29% of sales in February, down from 31% a year ago. NAR’s 2017 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers – released in late 2017 – revealed that the annual share of first-time buyers was 34%.Again, the supply shortage is palpable. Though the inventory of existing homes increased 4.6% from January it was down 8.1% from the year-ago period. This happens to be the 33rd straight month of year-over-year decline. At the current pace , it will take only 3.4 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR.Housing Market ConstraintsThe U.S. housing industry is gradually recovering from muted sales that stemmed from a severe winter. But interest rate hikes, growing labor shortage, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are restricting homebuilders to respond to this growing demand. The levy of tariff on steel, one of the major raw materials in the home building industry, is another headwind.  Also, caps on the deduction for mortgage interest following a recent overhaul of the tax code is likely to slow demand this year.Increase in borrowing cost due to higher mortgage rate is yet another dampener. According to data released on the same day, from the Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) Weekly Mortgage Applications Survey for the week ending March 16, 2018, mortgage applications decreased 1.1% from a week earlier, compared with an increase of 0.9% in the week before that. The Refinance Index decreased 5% from the previous week. The average fixed 30-year mortgage rate, however, edged down by 1 bps to 4.68%.Strong Economic Growth a Bright SpotYesterday, the Federal benchmark rates were hiked by 0.25%. Also, the central bank gave indications of two more hikes this year. This increase in benchmark rates should further increase the borrowing cost thereby putting pressure on sales. Despite the odds facing the industry, the sector is expected to keep up a good show in the upcoming period, led by a steady rise in wages and a record low unemployment rate.Moreover, a strong economic growth outlook for 2018 and 2019 from the policy makers keeps the optimism surrounding the housing market intact.  The Fed forecasts that unemployment this year will fall to 3.8% from the current rate of 4.1%. That would be the lowest jobless rate since April 2000. Unemployment is projected to fall even further in 2019 to 3.6% which would be the lowest rate since 1969.Spring EffectThe housing sector should buoy on the spring selling season (a peak time for home sellers) which is already on. Normally, the season starts in March and lasts through May-June thanks to warmer weather after a chilly winter and buyers’ tendency to move into a new house before the next school calendar starts. The season has traditionally favored the sector.All eyes are now on new home sales data, to be released on Friday, which economists expect will show a gain. This is particularly so as sales of new U.S. single-family homes had dropped for the second straight month in January and in four of the past six months.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

1825,DHI,"The Q1 earnings season is gathering steam and investors are eagerly awaiting results from major homebuilders, which have remained in the spotlight throughout the quarter for a number of reasons. The quarter witnessed massive volatility on uncertainty over the number of interest rate hikes and inconsistent monthly homebuilding data.Evidently, the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index has dropped 8.8% year to date. Again, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has declined 1% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the broader market’s (S&P 500) return of 3.8%.Indeed, the U.S. stock market seems to have taken a brief hiatus. That said, positive momentum at the start of the first-quarter reporting cycle remains intact for the industry given the solid earnings outlook and favorable economic fundamentals.Homebuilding at a GlanceSales of previously-owned homes jumped in February, marking the first gain in the last three months. This shows that an increasing number of Americans are looking to buy homes despite rising prices and limited availability.As revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales ticked up 3% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units from 5.38 million in January. Sales increased 1.1% from the year-ago level. The surge in existing-home sales (accounting for 90% of the market), after the slump in the last two months, indicates that competition is expected to heat up in the traditional spring home-buying season.Meanwhile, new home sales increased 0.5% year over year in February but dropped 0.6% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 622,000 units. Building permits, though down 5.7% month over month, rose 6.5% year over year in February.Rising mortgage rates and high prices of homes from inventory squeeze are indeed a bottleneck for buyers (mostly first-time). Apart from concerns over possibilities of a series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to grapple with growing labor shortage, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are keeping homebuilders from responding to growing demand.That said, the homebuilders’ confidence reading for March was a solid 70 buoyed by growing demand. In spite of inventory shortage, robust demand from a solid economy and a cheerful job market are making the industry go strong. With the strong economic fundamentals in place, the overall homebuilding picture is pretty encouraging for 2018.Solid Q1 Earnings ExpectationsMajority of the Zacks broad sectors (14 out of 16) are expected to be in the positive territory in the first quarter of 2018. Notably, homebuilding companies are broadly grouped in the Construction sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and companies seem to be on solid ground.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, construction sector earnings are expected to increase 35.4% in the first quarter compared with 20.6% in the preceding quarter. Revenues are expected to rise 15.8% (13.3% growth in Q4), while margins are likely to grow 1% (0.4% in Q4).In spite of the inventory woes and higher costs, it is a profitable strategy to zero in on a handful of housing stocks that are poised to beat earnings this quarter. An earnings beat would also pave the way for stock price appreciation.Notable Q1 Releases So FarA close look at the recently-released numbers of the nation’s homebuilding bigwigs unveils an encouraging picture. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) came up with stellar first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on solid fundamentals. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3% and surged 116.7% from the year-ago quarter. Though revenues missed the consensus mark, it increased 6% year over year, driven by higher housing revenues.Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected earnings and sales on solid demand. Notably, the company completed the CalAtlantic buyout in February. Stuart Miller, Chief Executive Officer of Lennar, said, ""Our first quarter results begin to display the true power of this combination.  Although these results do not include 2 ½ months of CalAtlantic's operations, all company metrics have performed as expected or better and we have grown more confident in our ability to exceed our $100 million synergy target in 2018 and we are on track to meet our $365 million synergy target in 2019.""Which Are the Right Picks?Picking the right stocks could be a daunting task given the wide range of companies in the housing space. One way to do it is by choosing stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Winning StocksFor investors ready to try out this strategy, we have highlighted four homebuilding stocks that may stand out this season.Our first choice is PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report). The company primarily engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses in the United States. This leading national homebuilder topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.51%. It also seems to be poised to beat expectations in the to-be-reported quarter. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +4.55%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 44 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.PulteGroup is scheduled to report first-quarter of fiscal 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens.We have chosen Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH  -  Free Report) that designs and builds single-family homes in the United States. The company topped earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 20.22%. It looks poised to beat expectations in the first quarter as well. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +31%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 74 cents.Meritage Homes is slated to report fourth-quarter results on Apr 25, after the closing bell.D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), a leading Texas-based national homebuilder, makes another attractive pick. The company has surpassed earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.83%. The company is poised to beat expectations in the to-be-reported quarter as well. It carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.72%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pinned at 86 cents. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.D.R. Horton is scheduled to report second-quarter of fiscal 2018 results on Apr 26, before market opens.The fourth option is a Denver, CO-based homebuilder M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (MDC  -  Free Report) that engages in homebuilding and financial service businesses in the United States. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 9.23%. Nonetheless, the company has surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 29.24%.For the upcoming release, M.D.C.

1826,DHI,"NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19. Last quarter, the company’s earnings fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.3%. Meanwhile, the company surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters, with the average being 11.03%.In fact, shares of NVR, one of the leading homebuilding companies, have gained 3.5% in the last six months, comparing favorably with the industry’s 1% decline.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe company has been reporting solid top-line numbers and the trend is expected to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well, owing to strong demand for homes, favorable job market and impressive economic conditions.Total revenues (Homebuilding & Mortgage Banking fees) totaled $6.3 billion in 2017, up 8.3% year over year. Homebuilding revenues increased 8%, primarily on 6.9% year-over-year increase in the number of settled units. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, evident from the company’s solid backlog. As of Dec 31, 2017, backlog of homes increased on a unit basis by 24% and dollar basis by 21% to $3.3 billion.  Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.51 billion, implying a year-over-year rise of 21.4%. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for homebuilding revenues is $1.4 billion, indicating an increase from $1.2 billion a year ago but a decrease from $1.8 billion in the prior quarter.Moreover, the company focuses on its disciplined business model, based on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risk. Unlike other homebuilders, NVR’s sole business is selling and building quality homes by typically acquiring finished building lots, without the risk of owning and developing land in a cyclical industry. The cash generated is thus used to expand business while returning excess capital to shareholders through buy-back programs.Again, with a modest rise in pricing and moderated construction costs, NVR was able to witness gross margin expansion of 150 basis points (bps) in the fourth quarter and 170 bps in full-year 2017. The trend is expected to be maintained in the quarter to be reported as well.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $31.44 per share, reflecting a 25.2% year-over-year increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NVR is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to surpass estimates.For NVR, however, this is not the case as listed below —Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: NVR’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Meanwhile, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.NVR, Inc.

This is due to Plumbing segment’s Delta brand’s investments in showrooms displays. The company anticipates approximately $12 million of investment during the first quarter, thanks to new store displays of cabinets at the Menards stores.Segment PerformanceComing to the different reportable segments, Plumbing Products, comprising about 46% of total revenues, is expected to contribute substantially to overall growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products revenues of $948 million reflects growth of 9.8% on a year-over-year basis.The Cabinets segment is expected to witness little growth this quarter. The consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues of $233 million reflects year-over-year rise of 0.7%.Decorative Architectural Products is expected to grow 3% year over year in the first quarter, owing to strong pro paint growth and Liberty Hardware business. Revenues at Windows and Other Specialty Products are expected to inch up 1.1%.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.86 billion, implying 4.6% growth. This is likely to translate into higher earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 49 cents, reflecting a 19.5% year-over-year increase.Quantitative Model PredictionOur proven model does not show that Masco is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1829,DHI,"PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.2%. It surpassed estimates in all of the last four quarters, resulting in an average earnings beat of 4.5%.Let us take a look at the factors that are likely to influence the company’s Q1 results.Prudent Land InvestmentsPulteGroup’s annual land acquisition strategies resulted in improved volumes, revenues and profitability for quite some time now. Its land strategy emphasizes on investing in shorter-lived and smaller land assets, thereby mitigating market risks. Consistent with its efforts to improve overall asset efficiency and reduce land risks by optioning lots, the company has successfully reduced owned land to just 4.2 years in 2017, down from 5.6 years a year ago. At the same time, it increased lots controlled under option to 37%.Apart from prudent capital allocation, PulteGroup is taking actions to improve the operating and financial performance. These initiatives include improving overhead leverage, increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies, which are expected to continue driving meaningful profits in the to-be-reported quarter.Healthy Housing Momentum to Boost RevenuesHealthy buyer demand along with good traffic points toward strong fourth-quarter revenues for the company. Homebuilders, like PulteGroup, have been doing well lately, courtesy of steady job and wage growth, recovering economy, historically low mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory.Homebuilding revenues increased 11.9% in 2017, comprising of Home sale and Land sale revenues, both of which increased 11.7% and 58.3%, respectively. Given the strong demand, the trend is likely to continue in the first quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.8 billion for Homebuilding revenues reflects growth of 10.5% from the year-ago quarter. Home sale revenues reflect growth of 12.8% year over year, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Land sale revenues will likely increase $12.4 million from the prior-year quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimates for Financial Services revenues of $44.4 million reflect a year-over-year increase of 6.3%.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.84 billion, implying 13.2% growth.Rising Costs Hurt MarginsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins by limiting homebuilders’ pricing power. Labor shortages are leading to higher wages while land prices are inflating due to limited availability, thus, denting homebuilders’ margins to some extent. Home sale’s gross margin decreased 140 basis points in 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, given the higher revenue expectation, the bottom-line is expected to increase significantly. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stand at 44 cents, reflecting a 41.9% increase from the prior-year quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that PulteGroup is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.PulteGroup has an Earnings ESP of +4.55% and a Zacks Rank #3, which makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

1830,DHI,"United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 18, after market closes.Last quarter, the company’s earnings met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 3.68%.In fact, shares of United Rentals have rallied 20.6% in the last six months, breezing past its industry’s gain of only 4.9%. Let’s delve deeper into factors that are likely to affect the company’s Q1 earnings.In the third as well as fourth quarter, the company posted positive rental rates after eight straight quarters of negative rates. We expect the first-quarter results to reflect positive rental rates as well. Factors such as strong organic growth led by improving end-market demand and acquisitions (NES Rentals and Neff Corporation) are likely to help the company witness an improvement in rates.The company’s core general rental business has been performing well and commercial construction remains robust. Meanwhile, continued strength in rig infrastructure is also expected to be a major tailwind for the to-be-reported quarter.Equipment Rentals, comprising about 86% total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equipment Rentals revenues of $1.5 billion reflects year-over-year growth of 25.3%. Sequentially, Equipment Rentals revenues are expected to decline 11.2%.The consensus estimate for rental equipment sales is $130 million, indicating an increase from $106 million a year ago. However, sales of new equipment are expected to decrease from $172 million in the preceding quarter. Contractor Supplies revenues will likely witness 3.8% growth year over year but are expected to be down 6.6% sequentially. Service and Other revenues are expected to rise 25.4% from the prior-year quarter and 5.8% sequentially.Project XL initiatives, prudent investments in fleet, accretive acquisitions and robust market demand enhance United Rentals’ prospects.Moreover, the company has been experiencing a growing demand in its core construction and industrial sectors. Commercial construction has been strong of late. The upstream oil and gas company is also gaining traction on improving macro conditions. Thus, demand for United Rentals’ products is expected to increase, thereby driving revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1.67 billion in the said quarter, up 23.3% from the year-ago quarter. For the quarter, the consensus estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.43 per share, implying significant 48.2% growth. What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that United Rentals is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Also, the reported figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,773 million. Strong revenue gains from the Government and Diversified Services segments more than offset the revenue decline at the Energy, Chemicals & Mining as well as the Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segments, thus resulting in sturdy top-line performance.Fluor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fluor Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteIn full-year 2017, the company’s total sales came in at $19.5 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago tally.Revenues at the Government segment were up 37.8% year over year to $957.3 million.

For 2018, it projects earnings per share in the range of $3.10-$3.50.Our TakeFluor’s top and bottom line surpassed estimates amid tough market conditions, thus highlighting its business model strength that has helped offset major headwinds. Also, it has a solid track record of receiving awards. Management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in future as well, which is expected to drive growth for the company. This apart, Fluor’s strategy of maintaining a good business portfolio mix permits it to focus on the more stable business markets and capitalize on developing the cyclical markets at suitable times.However, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s margins seem to be under pressure as it is transitioning from higher-margin engineering to lower-margin construction activities, particularly related to the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment.

1832,DHI,"Housing starts hit their highest level in more than a year in January after the sector recovered following a decline in December due to poor weather. Further, building permits, which is a reliable indicator of future demand, also increased appreciably. Overall, the monthly new residential construction report indicates that the sector is in fine fettle and likely has a strong year ahead.Continuing economic expansion, strong jobs market and wages growth are likely to ensure gains for the sector in the months to come. This is why it makes good sense to invest in select homebuilding stocks at this point.Multi-family Starts SurgeIn January, housing starts increased 9.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.33 million units. This is the highest level recorded since October 2016 and the second highest since the end of the Great Recession. The figure was also 7.3% higher than the January 2017 pace of 1.24 million and exceeded the estimated level of 1.23 million units by a wide margin.Single family housing starts increased by 3.7% to 877,000 after declining by 10.6% to 846,000 in December. More notably, multi-family housing starts jumped by 23.7% to 449,000 units. Building permits, a reliable indicator of future activity, increased by 7.4% to a 1.4 million pace, the highest on record since June 2007. Permits for multi-family homes surged 26.5% over the same period.Can Tight Supplies Spoil the Party?For some time now, tight supplies have threatened to derail the housing recovery. In December 2017, existing home sales came in at 5.57 million units, below most estimates, primarily due to a preexisting shortage in inventories. The resultant increase in housing prices and a spike in mortgage prices are the major impediments for the housing sector in the current year.Fortunately, homebuilders have responded by continuously stepping up the construction of single family homes. This is a clear indication that they continue to have confidence in the economy, since such homes are usually bought, not rented. Multi-family homes have also shown an increase, with a discernable shift toward luxury apartments.Moreover, a report released last week by the National Association of Home Builders indicated that homebuilder confidence has maintained at an appreciably high level during February. According to the report, the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index remained unchanged at 72, broadly in line with most analyst estimates. The figure is also near the highest level since 1999, indicating that a strong year lies ahead for the sector.Our ChoicesThe recent spike in housing starts bolsters the view that 2018 is likely to be a strong year for the housing sector. Also, homebuilders have responded to the problem of tight supplies by stepping up the construction of single-family homes. This is likely to address the supply-demand mismatch in the near future.Adding homebuilder stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report) is a home building and construction company.

1833,DHI,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 22.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 63 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.8%. Overall, Quanta Services has a dismal earnings surprise history, having missed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 2.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayQuanta Services remains confident about the prospects of its end markets in both of its segments — Electric Power and Oil & Gas — over the next two years. The company’s communications infrastructure services business seems to be performing brilliantly. For instance, at third-quarter end, the company managed to clinch more than $200 million of new contracts for several major North American communications companies.In the Unites States, the company is looking to expand its communications infrastructure as well. In this regard, Quanta Services is pursuing opportunities with various telecom and cable MSO customers.Moreover, the company’s thriving engineering and project management services are anticipated to be among its key growth drivers going forward. Also, Quanta Services has been witnessing a solid rebound in its end markets fuelled by key growth drivers like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and grid modernization. These factors are expected to prove conducive to the company’s top line in the coming quarters. The stock remains optimistic about its healthy backlog levels that are expected to grow further.Meanwhile, Quanta Services’ oil and gas segment outlook looks promising on improving mainline and natural gas distribution, and integrity markets. Going forward, the company continues to expect healthy levels of base load work including supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services and natural gas distribution. This apart, it is currently pursuing several high-voltage electric transmission award opportunities, which would reflect in the upcoming quarterly results.Additionally, the company’s Stronghold acquisition is likely to facilitate increased penetration in downstream and midstream petrochemical markets, consequently acting as a key factor influencing growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Quanta Services in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quanta Services has an Earnings ESP of -0.32%.

1834,DHI,"Housing starts and building permits made an impressive comeback in January, after declining 8.2% and 0.1%, respectively, in December 2017, due to cold weather. Moreover, home builder sentiment is at 72, making us reasonably certain about the positive momentum in the industry.Housing Starts Hit a 15-Month HighPer the latest jointly-released report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, new home construction (housing starts) increased 9.7% to 1.33 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in January 2018 from December 2017. This also marks the highest rise since October 2016. The figure improved 7.3% on a year-over-year basis, courtesy of a 3.7% rise in single-family housing starts and 23.7% spike in multi-family starts.Moreover, residential building permits, an indicator of upcoming construction activity, increased 7.4% in January to an annualized rate of 1.34 million units from December. This marks the highest surge in more than 10 years.Builders Remain ConfidentU.S. homebuilders’ confidence remains unchanged at 72 in February. The figure improved from the year-ago level of 65. The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) includes builder perceptions of current single-family home sales, sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers. A reading above 50 is considered confident enough. The upside was driven by higher sales expectations in the future, which rose two points to 80. Traffic of prospective buyers were steady at 54, but the component gauging current sales conditions dropped one point to 78.The current reading indicates that builders feel good about the recent tax cuts and have no qualms as such regarding the rising interest rates. Fueled by robust economic growth, Fed policymakers reckon three rate hikes in 2018, setting the stage for an increase in mortgage rates.NAHB Chairman Randy Noel, a custom homebuilder from LaPlace, Louisiana, stated, ""Builders are excited about the pro-business political climate that will strengthen the housing market and support overall economic growth.""Will the Upbeat Scenario Continue Through 2018?The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs.In spite of shortage in inventory, robust demand from a solid labor market is keeping the industry alive. General unemployment rates in the United States have been at a 17-year low of 4.1% for the fourth straight month, with around 200,000 jobs added in January 2018.  Other hurdles such as rising prices, thanks to the limited land availability which is keeping the affordability in check. Again, homebuilders continue to struggle against higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment.The economy is also in a good shape. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 following gains in the previous two quarters of more than 3%, per the “advance” estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.President Trump aims to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending. Although this may face various obstacles, we expect the plan to help the economy grow at a faster clip in 2018.Housing Industry’s StandThis positive momentum that the housing industry has been experiencing is evident from the improvement in its Zacks rank. The Zacks Homebuilding Industry has outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) in the past year. The industry has gained 38.6% compared with the S&P 500 index’s 16.7% rally. Notably, homebuilding ranks among the top 6% of all Zacks industries. Along with an impressive past performance of the industry, a favorable rank indicates that companies in this space are likely to benefit from positive factors.  Hence, it’s a wise idea to bet on a few housing stocks that are expected to cash in on this positive momentum.Choosing the Right StocksInvestors can bank on these housing stocks, which are making the most of positive housing momentum amid the ongoing adversities.

1835,DHI,"Housing starts and building permits declined 7% and 5.7%, respectively, in February after registering impressive growth in January. Meanwhile, construction costs escalated in the month, driven by price increases of several building materials including steel and aluminum, per the latest report released by the Associated General Contractors of America of Labor Department. But is it really a thing to fret about? Let’s delve deeper into the numbers to get a clearer picture of the current scenario.Low Multi-Family Units a DampenerThe decline in housing starts was largely propelled by a fall in multi-family starts that decreased 28% from the January figure. The February tally roughly doubles the losses, expected by analysts.However, single-family starts actually went up 2.9%. Consistent job growth and increased interest from first-time homebuyers are adding to this momentum.Residential building permits, an indicator of upcoming construction activity, dropped 5.7% in February to an annualized rate of 1.3 million units from January. Single-family home permits dipped 0.6% while the same for construction of multi-family homes declined 14.8%. Clearly, this indicates home builders are more optimistic about Americans opting for single family houses over apartments.Is the Reduced February Data Really a Concern?The latest disruption is not really a concern as single family units, which are generally of higher importance and are indicative of the economy strengthening further, have improved. Though building permits declined on a month-over-month basis, the figure rose 6.5% year over year.Solid economic growth and job market make us reasonably confident about the industry’s performance. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.1% in February, marking a 17-year low. Moreover, a healthy builder’s confidence reading in March is encouraging, too. Per the latest report of the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo, the Housing Market Index reading in the current month is still very strong at 70.Yet, builders are concerned about growing labor shortage and limited land availability that are shrinking margins. Apart from concerns  related to a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders are now worried about higher material costs due to the newly imposed tariffs on aluminum and steel. These are restricting homebuilders from responding to rising demand. However, these factors have failed to mar the industry’s performance to a great extent, which has been top notch for quite some time.The Zacks Homebuilding Industry has rallied 21.1% in the past year, comparing favorably with 16.3% growth of the broader market (S&P 500). Moreover, a good industry rank (top 33% of more than 250 industries) supports the growth potential of the stocks in this industry.Again, this industry’s expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 17.9% for three-five years is better than the broader market’s 9.7%.A few major homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) are well poised on bullish fundamentals of the housing market.All four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1836,DHI,"U.S. homebuilding was quite a rage in 2017, giving investors ample scope to rake in handsome gains. The industry is equally attractive this year, courtesy of solid economic growth and job market. Consistent job growth, growing interest from first-time homebuyers as well as high homebuilder confidence are adding to the momentum. Reflecting the positives, total earnings for the construction sector are expected to grow 33.4% in 2018 from the same period last year on 12.6% higher revenues.Meanwhile, limited land availability, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment are keeping homebuilders from responding to rising demand to some extent. Despite these challenges, notable homebuilders like PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) have been consistently performing well.Among the industry bellwethers, Lennar and D.R. Horton are the most prominent ones. Despite the companies having strong business lines and solid prospects, Lennar — a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock — appears to be comparatively better as an investment option than the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) D.R. Horton. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Before drawing a head-to-head comparison between Lennar and D.R. Horton, let’s check out a few key statistics of the companies.What Defines the Housing Giants?D.R. Horton, with a market cap of $18.9 billion, offers a diverse line of homes across various price points through a multi-brand platform. Moreover, the company enjoys one of the broadest geographic diversities in the industry and is not dependent on any particular market.D.R. Horton is fast acquiring homebuilding companies in desirable markets. In October 2017, the company acquired a 75% stake in Forestar Group, a residential and mixed-use real estate development company, for $558 million. The deal will help D.R. Horton expand operations in Texas — an area which has been witnessing positive housing momentum of late. It is also expected to contribute around $1 billion to D.R. Horton’s annual revenues over the next five years.With a market cap of $14.4 billion, Lennar offers a wide range of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult buyers. While Lennar’s Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, its ancillary businesses like Rialto, Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities.In February, Lennar acquired CalAtlantic Group Inc. for $9.3 billion (including debt) which will create one of the country’s top three home builders in 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets.Price PerformanceComing to price performance over the last six months, Lennar has gained 18%, compared with the broader industry’s 13.1%. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton has rallied 20.4% over the period, exceeding both Lennar’s and the broader industry’s performance. Prospects, Estimates Revisions, Earnings HistoryThe ability to consistently boost profit levels defying industry woes is a defining characteristic of the best companies. Analysts expect D.R. Horton to grow earnings at a 10% rate over the next three to five years. Comparatively, Lennar’s earnings are expected to grow 18.3% over the same time frame. Hence, Lennar’s higher growth rate implies greater potential for capital appreciation.For the near term, the expected current-year earnings growth rate for D.R. Horton stands at 30.7% compared with 38.9% for Lennar.Over the past 30 days, Lennar’s earnings estimates for the current year edged up 0.8% to $5.29 per share. Meanwhile, D.R. Horton’s estimates for the current year have increased 0.3% to $3.58.D.R. Horton’s projected sales growth for the current year is 14.8%, better than Lennar’s average of 12.7%.Hence, Lennar is a clear winner in terms of earnings growth expectations.Meanwhile, considering a more comprehensive earnings history, D.R. Horton has delivered positive surprises in all of the trailing four quarters. However, Lennar has surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters. D.R. Horton has a slightly superior average earnings surprise of 5.8% compared with Lennar’s 4.2%.Profitability and ReturnsProfitability and returns are a measure of the quality of a company’s business and its growth opportunities. Return on Capital (ROC) of Lennar is 6.90%, while D.R. Horton has a ROC of 10.5%. The interpretation is that D.R. Horton’s business generates a higher return on investment than Lennar’s.Again, Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. ROE for the trailing 12 months for Lennar and D.R. Horton is 12% and 14.8%, respectively. While both the stocks have scored above the industry level of 11.8%, D.R. Horton has an edge here.ValuationBoth the stocks are a little overvalued as is evident from their unfavorable P/E, P/B and P/S ratios compared to the homebuilding industry.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple for Lennar and D.R. Horton are 15.7 and 15.2, respectively, while the industry’s is 14.7. D.R. Horton’s shares look a shade cheaper compared with Lennar.Again, trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B) multiple for Lennar is 1.82, compared with 2.09 for D.R. Horton. The industry’s P/B is 1.79.Trailing 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) multiples for Lennar and D.R. Horton are 1.14 and 1.18, respectively, compared with the industry’s 1.05.Lennar is cheaper of the two stocks on book value and sales basis.VolatilityTo gauge the market risk of a particular stock, investors use beta. Stocks with beta above 1 are more volatile than the market as a whole. Conversely, a beta below 1 implies below average systematic risk. Lennar has a beta of 1.31 while D.R. Horton’s beta is 1.20. D.R. Horton’s shares are therefore less volatile than that of Lennar.Bottom LineLennar beats D.R. Horton in terms of earnings growth expectation and valuation, while the latter enjoys an advantage in terms of market cap, revenue expectation and returns.Both the companies remain positive about the overall homebuilding market that will continue to gain on solid demand for homes, favorable job market and strength in economy.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa!

1837,DHI,"This week we have several important economic reports coming out.  These reports will give us key data on future indicators regarding inflation, housing, retail sales, housing, and consumer sentiment. The biggest report came out before the opening bell this morning; the Consumer Price Index, also called the CPI.  This report is a great indicator of inflationary measurers and has a ripple effect impacting both the Housing market index, and housing starts data, both of which are due out later this week.The CPI showed that year over year core inflation held steady at 1.8%.  This indicates that inflation will probably be more gradual than previously expected.As you can see in the chart, both CPI, and core CPI have begun to pull back from its recent spike.  Which is key to the future growth of the markets as inflation has been the biggest worry among investors.  This data combined with the recent jobs report that showed that wages were not increasing as fast as previously expected helped the markets start the day in the green.  Further, this news caused the 10 year treasury yields to pull back this morning.  All positive signs for the markets.  As of late, the inflationary issues have been putting pressure on the building sector as fears of the Fed rates rising faster than anticipated have subdued several members of the segment.  You can see this downward pressure in the year to date Price return graph.  While the S&P 500 has gained 4.2%, the building sector has fallen by 12.3% with the big players like KB Homes (KBH  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton (DRI) performing well below that of the S&P 500. But the positive CPI report bodes well for the upcoming Housing Market Index, and Housing Starts reports that come out later this week.  If these data points stay at or near their current high levels, expect the building sector to bounce back. We will also see two other reports that are closely tied together, the Retail Sales report, and Consumer Sentiment.The Retail report is expected to show a big bounce back from a reading of -0.3% to +0.4% after weak results in both December and January.  Sales fell after a strong three month stretch between September and November due to big holiday sales. The largest factor for the upbeat retail sales expectations is overall consumer sentiment which has remained at elevated levels for the past several months.The data has maintained a reading of 95 or higher for the past 7 consecutive months, and is expected to come in at 98.8 when the report is released on Friday.  If consumer sentiment data comes in as expected it will be a positive indicator for the retail sector, as this report gauges consumer spending, and the overall attitude of the economy.  If both the Retail sales and Consumer sentiment numbers come in as expected, several key retail companies will be positively impacted.  These 6 companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy rating, and are very well positioned to take advantage of these data points.     Overall, this morning’s CPI report has eased many fears of increasing inflation, and has begun to set a positive tone for the markets. The coming reports due out later in the week can further boost this positive tone if they come in as expected.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1840,DHI,"Acuity Brands, Inc. (AYI  -  Free Report) is slated to announce first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 9, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.25%. In fact, the company clocked a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 0.96%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLately, Acuity Brands has been facing issues with lower gross margins. In fact, its adjusted gross profit margin in the last reported quarter of fiscal 2017 declined 100 basis points (bps) compared with the prior-year period. This was primarily due to softness in the lighting industry.The overall growth rate of the lighting market over the last few quarters remained muted and even slightly down compared with year-ago periods. This is likely to exist in the fiscal 2018 too. Lack of skilled labor and thereby higher costs associated with it, and pricing pressure in certain end markets are leading to softness in the industry. Also, Acuity Brands expects volatility in demand among certain sales channels and geographies to persist in the next few quarters as well.Apart from labor shortages, customer delays (particularly on the West Coast), and Chinese competition are expected to create pressure on pricing in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, Acuity Brands expects the growth rate for lighting and building management solutions in the North American market, which includes renovation and retrofit activity and comprises more than 97% of its revenues, to be up low single digits for fiscal 2018, reflecting an expected rebound in the second half of the year.Nonetheless, long-term fundamental drivers of the markets that the company serves are still positive and intact. Acuity Brands is the leader in the North American nonresidential lighting fixture market for its Lithonia brand. The company remains upbeat about its addressable market or the North American market and expects it to return to growth in fiscal 2018 banking on executing strategies focused on opportunities for new construction and renovation projects, expanding into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and introducing lighting and building management.For the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $2.15, reflecting a 7.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $884 million, implying 3.9% growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.Acuity Brands does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Acuity Brands is -2.44%.Zacks Rank: Acuity Brands carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1841,DHI,"The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders ended 2017 on a high note as the housing market index (HMI) was at 74 in December. This marks the highest reading since 1999.The December reading was up from a downwardly revised November level of 69. Before the downward revision, November showed the highest level of builder confidence in eight months.The builders seem to be shaking off worries associated with the Republican tax plan, and apparently believe that the business incentives in the plan are likely to offset the negatives. Earlier, builders had strongly opposed the plan and were of the opinion that the House Republican tax would eliminate one of the benefits of ownership for many would-be homebuyers.The plan would limit the mortgage-interest deduction on newly purchased homes at $500,000. This is quite a dramatic shift from the current cap of $1 million. The proposed capping of the mortgage-interest deduction could diminish the benefit of the deduction outside of the costly housing markets. The National Association of Realtors had said that the memo “appears to confirm many of our biggest concerns.”Nonetheless, the latest spike in builders’ confidence tells the other side of the story and reassures the industry’s strength. In the words of NAHB chairman, Granger MacDonald, ""Housing market conditions are improving partially because of new policies aimed at providing regulatory relief to the business community.”This index primarily reflects builders’ perceptions of current single-family home sales and sales expectations for the next six months. Notably, all three HMI components gained in December.Current sales conditions increased four points to 81. Buyer traffic increased eight points to 58 and sales prediction over the next six months grew three points to 79.Favorable Economic Data Signal Strong PotentialThe dynamic performance of the broader construction sector has been majorly buoyed by strong homebuilding activities. Homebuilding spending has increased 6.6% so far this year. Also, there are signs of increased inclination toward home purchases among millennials, a generation that had to some extent refrained from entering the market.The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs.The world’s largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% in the July-September quarter, marking the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and a nice pickup from the second quarter's 3.1%. Per the latest Goldman Sachs forecast, U.S. GDP growth is expected to come in at 2.5% in 2018, up from the 2.2% forecast for 2017 and 1.6% registered in 2016.Economists are of the opinion that the rebound in the U.S. economy along with a further decline in unemployment (4.1% in November) will keep the momentum alive for the sector. The November figure marked the lowest since December 2000. The United States has added jobs for 86 straight months, the longest streak so far. Moreover, Americans are highly optimistic about the economy with consumer confidence hitting a 17-year high.Though the U.S. housing industry is gradually recovering from damages caused by the recent hurricanes, limited land availability, labor shortage and higher material costs, there is nothing to fret about. Also, despite the repeated hikes of the Federal Reserve’s interest rates, optimism surrounding the housing market remains largely unaffected.In fact, so far this year, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has widely outperformed the broader market (S&P 500), as you can see below.Major homebuilders such as NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), TRI Pointe Group, Inc. (TPH  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) are well poised on the bullish fundamentals of the housing market.While NVR sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), TRI Pointe and D.R. Horton carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1842,DHI,"The construction sector witnessed a dynamic 2017. Rising residential demand along with a rebounding U.S. economy eased political and economic challenges.The Year So FarThe construction sector has demonstrated stability through 2017 and witnessed sustainable growth amid various challenges. It goes without saying that President Donald Trump was the biggest factor. Investors were expecting faster growth based on Trump’s assurance of significant tax cuts, higher infrastructure spending and lesser regulations.Although the momentum slowed a bit later, the S&P 500 index topped the milestone of 2,500 for the first time on mid-September, surpassing the 266% rise during the 1949-56 run, per Bloomberg. Notably, the surge came in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey & Irma, depicting strong complacency in the stock market.Although public construction declined in 2017, it can get back into the positive territory with expansions in terminals and runways, airport construction, as well as with public education construction spending. On the other hand, residential spending increased 6.6% in the first 10 months of 2017, reinstating its stature, per the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau.So far, it has been a good 2017 for the housing market and the trend is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs. Consumer Confidence, a key determinant of the economy’s health, improved significantly in November, reaching its highest level in 17 years. Again, there are signs of increased inclination of home purchases among millennials, a generation that had to some extent refrained from entering the market.Despite the repeated hikes of the Federal Reserve’s interest rates, optimism surrounding the housing market remains largely unaffected. The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% in the July-September quarter, marking the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and a nice pickup from the second quarter's 3.1%. Notably, it is the first time since 2014 that the U.S. economy has witnessed growth of 3% or more for two straight quarters.Will Supply Shortage & Labor Hurdles Restrain the Positive Momentum?What is plaguing the industry of late is the inventory shortage prevailing in the U.S. real estate market and the upward pressure it is creating on prices in several parts of the country. Housing affordability fell in the third quarter of 2017, according to a National Association of Home Builders or NAHB survey. Meanwhile, labor shortage along with rising land and labor costs pose a threat to the companies’ margins.Nonetheless, economists are of the opinion that the rebounding U.S. economy accompanied by low level of unemployment (4.1% in November) will keep the momentum alive for the sector as a whole. November figure was the lowest since December 2000. The United States has added jobs for 86 straight months, the longest streak.All these positive factors have helped the construction sector to grow nearly 23.3% this year, higher than the broader market’s (S&P 500) rally of 19.3%. Notably, investing in the Construction sector might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 6% (1 out of 16 sectors) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.Keeping the positive momentum in mind, here are eight construction stocks that more than doubled the S&P 500 YTD and will continue to outperform in the coming months given that these have potentially superior weighting methodologies and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Sterling Construction Company, Inc. (STRL  -  Free Report) – Up 112.1%Sterling along with its subsidiaries, operates as a heavy civil construction company in Texas, Utah, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, California, Hawaii, and other states in the United States.

Thus, the company is well positioned to generate substantial earnings growth in the future. Looking beyond 2017, the company expects to benefit from a steady stream of heavy civil project opportunities across its geographies as well as its residential business. The company’s earnings are expected to increase 211.3% for the current year and 119.1% for the next.NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) – Up 102.4%NVR is engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings. NVR has delivered stellar performance so far this year, driven largely by its disciplined business model, focus on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risk. Potential housing revenues from backlog increased 15% to $3.42 billion.Also, the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 11.4% and 0.1%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2017 from 2016 levels. The uptick can be attributed to favorable market conditions in 2017, which led to a higher sales absorption rate on a year-over-year basis.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a long-term (three-five years) expected EPS growth rate of 17%. The company’s 2017 earnings are expected to grow 42.5% and 16.8% for 2018.D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) – Up 83%Texas-based D.R. Horton is one of the leading national homebuilders.

1843,DHI,"The construction industry in the United States is expected to grow by leaps and bounds in 2018. Also, a ratio which measures the optimism surrounding the sector’s growth hit a record high recently. Further, hiring in the sector has been unusually high over the last one year. Meanwhile, a leaked draft of Trump’s infrastructure spending plans indicates that the GOP will prioritize improving the existing roads and highways as well as non-federally funded utilities in the country.Lastly, strong economic growth and recent tax reforms continue to boost the industry’s growth. Such a scenario quite naturally calls for investing in construction stocks. Construction Spending Hits a Record HighIn November 2017, construction spending increased, surpassing expectations. The figure came in at $1.26 trillion, logging an annual growth rate of 2.4%. Such strength in spending was the result of increased investments across real estate, commercial and residential projects. Further, spending on private construction remained high and invited gains to the industry.To top it all, firms operating in the space are also looking to expand their workforce as evident from unusually high hiring even under dire circumstances. Per the latest data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the construction industry added as many as 30,000 jobs to the U.S. economy in December, when parts of the country were ravaged by harsh winters.In 2017 alone, the sector added 210,000 jobs, which represented a surge of 35% from 2016. Economists have already stated that such figures are indicative of excellent performance by the space in 2018.Moreover, the ratio which measures the industry optimism over business growth hit a record high. Such optimism is backed primarily by business-friendly economic conditions and overall growth. Also, economists have stated that construction in the office market, transportation and retail will see a boom this year.Infrastructure Spending to be Beefed UpOptimism regarding growth of the construction industry surged post President Trump’s victory as one of his key priorities was infrastructure investment. Although spending on government projects have declined 3.4% year to date, the figure is still close to an increase of 3% -- the highest monthly gain in three years – that it hit in October 2017. This is courtesy of higher spending at the federal, state and local levels.Increased infrastructure spending was the cornerstone of Trump’s pesidential campaign. As a matter of fact, he had proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure spending financed by new tax credits to encourage private equity investors. He plans to deploy $200 billion in federal money over the next decade to “incentivize another $800 billion in spending from state and local authorities and private entities.”That said, the question on investors’ mind is: Will infrastructure spending be increased at all? One can roughly gauge that this might be possible. Efforts made by members of the GOP to push through tax reforms are indicative of their legislative intent. More than anything, it is the repute and the goodwill that President Trump and his team would like to maintain.A leaked draft of Trump’s infrastructure policy, published on Axios on Jan 23, 2018, clearly mentions that the administration is not keen on building new roads or highways and taking up “unsustainable projects.” The administration instead focuses on improving the conditions of the existing roads and highways. The plan also hints at protecting non-federally funded utilities within the country. Such statements give a clear indication that the citizens will soon witness the passing of the Infrastructure Spending Bill.Fall in Starts a Momentary HiccupThe year started with a disappointing reading for housing starts. Per the Department of Commerce, housing starts declined 8.2% in December — its largest percentage drop since November 2016. However, analysts see such a downturn as temporary. Further, housing possibly felt the chill from December’s brutally low temperatures.Also, the 2.4% increase in homebuilding to 1.202 million units in 2017 is one important point to be noted. This is the highest level recorded in a decade. Strong economic growth, a robust labor market and tax cuts are continuing to bolster the housing industry.Future demand is also likely to remain strong given the shortage in supply of existing homes. Also, homebuilders are not planning more speculative homes. These are units which still do not have a buyer. And this phenomenon has not been witnessed since the last housing boom, which preceded the recession of 2008. (Read More)4 Best Stocks to BuyMarket watchers remain optimistic about the construction industry’s growth under robust economic conditions.

1844,DHI,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 31, before the opening bell.The homebuilder delivered in-line earnings last quarter. The company surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters, the average beat being 5.01%.Like other homebuilders, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically low interest/mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory, point at strong demand in 2017.Resultantly, the company’s share price has increased more than 41% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s 29.9% rally. Let’s See How Things Are Shaping Up for Q1Recently, D.R. Horton updated it guidance for fiscal 2018 tax rate. The company now expects it to be 26%. It will be taking approximately $115 million non-cash charge in Q1 due to a change in the Federal tax code. The company expects 25% tax rate for fiscal 2019.Let’s take a look at the other metrics of the company, i.e. revenues, order growth and gross margin. D.R. Horton, one of the top builders in the United States, now expects its backlog conversion rate for the first quarter to be in the range of 83-86%. This compares favorably with the year-ago level of 82%.The company’s homebuilding revenues increased 11.4% year over year in the preceding quarter. However, for the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues (comprising about 98% of total revenues) of $3,189 million indicates a decrease from $4,067 million in the last quarter and $4,066.5 million in the year-ago period. This downside may be due to the weather issues.Net sales orders increased 18% to 10,333 homes on continued improvement in the preceding quarter. For the upcoming release, the consensus estimate for net sales orders were 10,477 units compared with 9,241 units a year ago. Home closings is estimated to be 10,470 units compared with 13,165 units in the preceding quarter and 9,404 units a year-ago.On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $85 million indicates a decrease from $93 million in the prior quarter and $92.6 million a year ago.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues stands at $3.28 billion, implying 12.8% year-over-year growth.Now, for the company’s gross margin, D.R. Horton expects home sales gross margin to be around 20%. In the year-ago quarter, it was 19.8% in the preceding quarter, the company’s gross margin on home sales contracted 10 basis points (bps) year over year to 20.3%. Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.For SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, the company expects it to be in the range of 9.5-9.8%. This compares with the year-ago level of 9.5%.Nonetheless, D.R. Horton remains well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Overall, for the fiscal first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 63 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 14.6% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.D.R.

1845,DHI,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) was chosen by NextBridge Infrastructure to construct the Ontario East-West Tie Line Project in northern Ontario through a competitive bidding process. The leading specialized contracting services company booked undisclosed value of the contract, which is expected to commence late next year and conclude in late 2020.Per the deal, Quanta Services, through its operating subsidiary, Valard Construction, will offer construction services including project management, material management as well as construction permitting. The company will also provide installation services for around 290 miles of double circuit 230 kilovolt transmission line connecting Marathon Transformer Station and Lakehead Transformer Station.The company will lend its expertise to safely and cost-effectively execute the project, which is intended to improve the long-term reliability of the electricity supply in northwestern Ontario. Further, the company believes the project is capable of creating up to 700 jobs during construction and providing extra economic benefits to the local community.Existing Business ScenarioCurrently, the company is pursuing multiyear capital programs, which include both large and smaller electric power infrastructure projects. Large high-voltage electric transmission project opportunities with numerous utilities and merchant transmission companies in North America bode well for long-term growth. Particularly, the North America electric transmission and distribution markets are expected to act as one of the key catalysts for the company.The company remains confident about the prospects of end markets in both of its segments, namely, Electric Power and Oil & Gas segments, over the next two years. The company’s oil and gas segment outlook also looks promising, primarily due to the improving mainline and natural gas distribution and integrity markets. Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 20.5% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 15.5%.Despite these positives, the company’s business is anticipated to be affected by uncertain global political and economic conditions.

1846,DHI,"The housing market has of late been going strong, courtesy of steady job growth and gradual economic recovery. U.S. homebuilders' sales outlook has become more optimistic on the recent rise in homebuilder sentiment. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index touched an eight-month high of 70 in November — the second highest since recession.One such company cashing in on the favorable backdrop is NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report). The company is engaged in the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings.So far this year, NVR’s shares have skyrocketed 101.9%, outperforming the industry’s 62.4% rally. Also, the company outperformed the industry in all the other time frames we considered – 4-week, 12-week and 52-week.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for current-year and next-year earnings have moved north by 6.4% and 12.3%, respectively, in the last 60 days. This bullish analysts’ sentiment justifies the stock’s current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting the company to outperform in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What Makes NVR a Solid Pick?Solid Business Model & Stellar Performance: NVR’s solid performance was largely owing to its disciplined business model, focus on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risk. Furthermore, the company’s sole business include selling and building quality homes by typically acquiring finished building lots, without the risk of owning and developing land in a cyclical industry.Homebuilding revenues increased 10.1% year over year in the first three quarters of 2017, primarily on a 7.8% year-over-year increase in the number of settled units. The improvement in the number of settled units was attributable to a 15.6% year-over-year hike in backlog unit balance as of Sep 30, 2017. Potential housing revenues from backlog increased 15% to $3.42 billion.Also, the number of new orders and the average sales price of new orders increased 11.4% and 0.1%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2017 from 2016 levels. The uptick was owing to favorable market conditions in 2017, which led to a higher sales absorption rate on a year-over-year basis.Impressive Expected Earnings & Revenue Growth: Possibly, nothing is more important than earnings growth.On this front, NVR has put up a historical (3–5 year) EPS growth rate of 31.1% compared with the industry average of 27%. Moreover, the stock has a long-term (3–5 years) expected EPS growth rate of 17%, higher than the industry average of 12%.The company’s 2017 earnings are expected to grow 42.5%, while the Zacks Homebuilding Industry’s earnings are likely to increase 17.4%.Furthermore, NVR’s sales are expected to increase 11.7% in the current year compared with the industry average growth of 8.3%, thereby making it a great pick in terms of Growth investment.Low Beta & Higher Return on Equity: NVR’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. ROE in the trailing 12 months is 38.2% while the industry gained 10.8%, reflecting the company’s efficient usage of shareholders’ funds.Again, a stock with beta less than 1 suggests that the price movement of the stock is not highly correlated with the market. Since they are less volatile than the market, they are safer bets at the moment. NVR has an impressive beta of 0.75. Adding it to your portfolio brings down your portfolio’s overall beta, thereby reducing its risk.Solid VGM Score: NVR has a VGM Score of B. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth, and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 make solid investment choices.Other Stocks to ConsiderYou can consider a few other top-ranked stocks in the same space.Sterling Construction Company Inc (STRL  -  Free Report) sports a Zack Rank #1. Its earnings are expected to grow 211.3% this year.D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) holds a Zack Rank #2. Its earnings are expected to grow 17.4% in fiscal 2018.TRI Pointe Group, Inc. (TPH  -  Free Report) also carries a Zacks Rank #2. Its earnings are expected to grow 12.5% this year.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1847,DHI,"Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has clinched an engineering, procurement and construction management (“EPCM”) contract from Vopak Terminal Durban (Pty) Ltd to deliver the Vopak Growth 4 Project in Durban. The engineering and construction firm booked undisclosed value of the contract in fourth-quarter 2017.One of Vopak’s largest storage facility projects in South Africa, this expansion project is pertinent to the Vopak’s program of facilitating enhanced demand for fuel with cleaner specifications in Southern Africa. Fluor will use its Zero Base Execution approach to develop fit-for-purpose integrated solutions in order to optimize the expansion of the facility.Flour will leverage extensive networks to source material and equipment competitively, which would add value to the project. Further, the company will use local contractors as well as vendors to develop and sustain the local labor market as well as enterprises.Our TakeFluor has a solid track record of receiving awards, and management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in future as well, which is expected to drive growth. Going forward, it anticipates an increase in front-end engineering awards. Moreover, the company remains optimistic about investment projects, particularly on LNG projects in North America, chemical facilities and pipeline projects in the United States, as well as refining and chemical projects in the Middle East and Asia.The company’s healthy level of backlog in infrastructure, government, life sciences and advanced manufacturing has allowed it to offset multiyear decline in mining, metals and oil & gas markets. The long-term prospects of the company also remain strong with existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for existing coal-fired power plants.Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 24.9% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.9%.However the fact remains that, currently, the company is facing a dearth of engineering and new awards which has hurt its growth prospects significantly. Presently, the company’s margins are under pressure as it is transitioning from higher margin engineering to lower margin construction activities, particularly related to Energy & Chemicals & Mining segment.Volatility in commodity prices, and the cyclical nature of its commodity-based business lines, poses significant challenges for the company in the upcoming quarters. This apart, sluggish economic growth worldwide and softness in key geographic regions also pose challenges. These conditions are hurting the company’s non-oil and gas end markets as well.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report), D.R.

1848,DHI,"Lennar Corporation’s (LEN  -  Free Report) diversified line of home offerings for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers and positive housing market fundamental are the driving factors for this leading homebuilder in the United States.However, labor shortage along with rising land and labor costs pose a threat to the company’s margins.Last quarter, the company’s earnings and revenues surpassed expectations on for the seventh time in a row. Its third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the bottom line improved 5% from $1.01 reported a year ago.  Solid demand for homes, favorable job market and interest rates along with increased consumer confidence helped the homebuilder post higher numbers.Total revenues of $3.26 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.22 billion by 1.3%. The top line also grew 15% year over year as the homebuilding, financial services and multi-family segments performed significantly well.Key Growth DriversLennar is one of the well-positioned homebuilders to capitalize on the housing recovery driven by diverse revenue mix, steady top-line performance, above-average order growth and improving SG&A leverage.The company offers a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. Additionally, it regularly upgrades homes to cater to the changing consumer requirements. For example, it introduced NextGen homes, or a home within a home, to allow the homebuyers — who need to accommodate children and parents — to share the cost of their mortgage and other living expenses.Meanwhile, Lennar’s continued focus on digital marketing is driving traffic to its communities. Also, the company uses various technology initiatives to improve its operating model. In this regard, Lennar’s dynamic pricing tool seems to be quite successful.Furthermore, Lennar’s ancillary businesses like Rialto and Multi-Family provide diversification as well as complementary long-term growth opportunities. Notably, Rialto is a significant source of valuable homebuilding deals and an important contributor to cash flow.These initiatives have helped Lennar to deliver stellar performances. Evidently, the company’s total revenues grew 17% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 on the back of a solid 28.3% rise in homebuilding revenues. The top line was primarily driven by a 13% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 3% rise in the average sales price of the homes delivered. In the meantime, Lennar’s core homebuilding results remain consistent with the slow and steady housing recovery.Lennar remains focused on continued improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and investments in technology. In sync with this, it plans to reduce SG&A expenses in the range of 8.5-8.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The company maintained its 7% to 10% growth target and is focused on driving operating costs down, in order to drive bottom line and cash flow.Moreover, Lennar has agreed to take over CalAtlantic Group Inc.  in a deal worth $9.3 billion (including debt) announced on Oct 31. This, in turn, might make Lennar one of the country’s top three home builders among 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets. The combined entity will have a footprint touching approximately 50% of the U.S. population and is expected to generate meaningful cost savings. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.ConcernsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. While labor shortages are leading to higher wages, land prices are inflating due to limited availability. Going ahead, more inflation is anticipated that might dent homebuilders’ margins. In the first nine months of fiscal 2017, Lennar’s gross margin on home sales decreased 90 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in construction and land costs per home.So far this year, Lennar’s shares have gained 44.8% compared with 64.6% growth of the industry. Earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 have remained stable in the past 30 days.Nonetheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to outperform in the near term owing to the synergies arising out of the CalAtlantic buyout. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors may also consider stocks like NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report).NVR sports a Zacks Rank #1 and is likely to witness a rise of 42.5% in earnings for the current year.D.R. Horton, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, is expected to witness 17.4% earnings growth this year.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1849,DHI,"U.S. housing starts turned the corner in June, rebounding from a three month long slump. Ground was broken on new homes at the sharpest annual rate recorded over four months. Surely, Wednesday’s report on housing from the Department of Commerce will a long way toward restoring confidence in a sector that has had more than its fair share of troubles recently.Fresh questions had risen about the health of the homebuilding industry after a particularly dismal report on homebuilder sentiment was released on Tuesday. But the housing starts report indicates that demand on the buyer side remains high at a time when homebuilder stocks are surging. Picking up homebuilding stocks continues to remain a lucrative option at this time.June Rebound Ends 3-Month DeclineAccording to the Department of Commerce, housing starts increased by 8.3% from May to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.22 million in June. This represents a 2.1% annual increase, the highest recorded in four months. June’s housing starts were also considerably higher than the estimated level of 1.16 million. The increase experienced last month comes after three straight monthly declines. Additionally, May’s housing starts figure of 1.09 million, originally the lowest recorded in eight months, was revised upward to 1.12 million.Building permits also increased, by 7.4%, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.25 million. The forward looking metric also experienced a year-over-year increase of 5.1%, implying that housing activity is likely to remain strong in the near future. Meanwhile, single family starts increased by 6.3%, indicating that homebuilding companies were prioritizing homes built for sale over those intended for rentals.Construction of multifamily homes, which includes apartment buildings and townhouses, increased by 13.3%. This substantial increase represents a strong rebound after five consecutive months of declines. Additionally, housing starts experienced increases over three of the four geographical regions surveyed. This includes a 22% jump in the Midwest. Meanwhile, housing completions increased by 5.2% to the highest level witnessed since Nov 2016.Is Falling Homebuilder Confidence Really a Worry? The bullish housing starts report is particularly significant since it comes immediately after a substantial decline in homebuilder sentiment. In July, homebuilder sentiment declined from 67 to 64, its lowest level in eight months. The immediate trigger for the decline is the rising cost of construction materials, following the imposition of a steep tariff on Canadian lumber. Initially, homebuilders were hopeful that President Trump would deliver on promises to curtail regulations. However, the index remains well above 50, which means that improvement in the sector continues, but at a slower pace.But the industry is less hopeful of action on the policy front, since Trump’s promises continue to remain unfulfilled. Instead, homebuilders are depending on steady demand from buyers, borne out by the latest data on groundbreaking for homes. A strong labor market and a soft interest rate regime have ensured consistent gains for homebuilder stocks. For instance, LGI Homes, Inc. (LGIH  -  Free Report) and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) have gained 48.3% and 34.1% year to date. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB  -  Free Report) has increased by 15% over the same period.Our ChoicesA strong housing starts report has gone a long way in restoring investors’ confidence in the homebuilding sector. Steady buyer demand and a soft interest rate regime are the factors which continue to power the sector.Adding homebuilding stocks to your portfolio looks like a prudent option at this point in time. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) is a well-known homebuilder in the United States and one of the largest in the state of California.KB Home has expected earnings growth of 51.7% for the current year.

1850,DHI,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for DHI’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Longer Term Price Change for D.R. HortonWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of DHI, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 36.5% to 22.5%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 73.6%. Clearly, DHI is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors. D.R. Horton, Inc. Price D.R. Horton, Inc. Price | D.R. Horton, Inc. QuoteQuarter EPS Estimate Change for D.R. Horton StockWhile looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock, you shouldn’t forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there. This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season, which is obviously vital for momentum investors.Right now, DHI is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter’s earnings estimate projections. In the time frame, EPS estimates for D.R. Horton have gone up by 6.3% compared to a flat industry average move, suggesting that not only is DHI heading in the right direction, but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too.DHI Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with DHI as of late.Over the past two months, 19 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that eight estimates have moved upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, DHI was expected to post earnings of $3.12 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $3.22 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have DHI as a security with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep DHI on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1851,DHI,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because D.R. Horton is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for DHI in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 66 cents per share for DHI, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DHI, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +4.78% heading into earnings season.D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | D.R. Horton, Inc. QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

1852,DHI,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, D.R. Horton has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.8. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts D.R. Horton’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 14.9) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that D.R. Horton has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for D.R. Horton’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, D.R. Horton has a P/S ratio of about 1.2. This is noticeably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, D.R. Horton currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes DHI a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though D.R. Horton might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of A. This gives DHI a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>) Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past thirty days and thirteen lower, while the full year estimate has seen a similar trend in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 4.7% in the past one month, while the full year estimate has slipped 1.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and Consensus  D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and Consensus | D.R. Horton, Inc. QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineD.R. Horton is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 29% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Nonetheless, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1853,DHI,"The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped slightly in the first month of 2018 after reaching an 18-year high in December 2017, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ (NAHB) Housing Market Index. Nonetheless, homebuilders remain confident about the upcoming period, given the changes to the tax code that will likely promote the small business sector and boost broader economic growth.The January 2018 reading was down two points to 72 from the December level of 74. Notably, all three Housing Market Index (HMI) components slipped meagerly in January. Current sales conditions decreased one point to 79. Buyer traffic decreased four points to 54 and sales prediction over the next six months slipped one point to 78.Importantly, the HMI gauge of future sales expectations remained in the 70s, signaling that housing demand should continue to grow this year.In the words of NAHB Chairman Randy Noel, a custom homebuilder from LaPlace, Louisiana, “Our members are excited about the year ahead, even as they continue to face building-material price increases and shortages of labor and lots.”The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs.After the solid 3.1% economic growth in the in the July-September quarter, the world’s largest economy is expected to have advanced 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, per the latest Atlanta Fed’s real-time Q4 GDP growth estimate. This solid upbeat projection holds particularly true when one of the nation’s key economic drivers, i.e. construction activity, is gradually strengthening its footprint accompanied by a declining unemployment rate (4.1% in December 2017).Disruptions caused by the hurricanes and other natural disasters seemed to have short lived as revealed from recent economic data reports.However, challenges like inventory shortage are still prevailing in the U.S. real estate market and creating upward pressure on prices in several parts of the country, thereby affecting affordability. Again, higher construction costs along with rising land and labor costs pose a threat to the companies’ margins. Meanwhile, the recent tax-cut legislation that limited deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes is also expected to hurt sales to quite an extent.Homebuilding Industry PerformanceIn the last six months, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has widely outperformed the broader market (S&P 500), as you can see below. Again, investing in the industry might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 7% (19 out of 256 industries) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.Major homebuilders such as Century Communities, Inc.

1854,DHI,"The euphoria surrounding the new tax legislation is pushing Wall Street to new heights this year. After hitting 2,700 on the second trading session of the New Year, the S&P 500 breached another milestone of 2,800, for the first time.Moreover, the Dow Jones also crossed the 26,000 mark, easily setting the record for the fastest 1,000-point rise in its history after topping 25,000 on Jan 4 (read: Top & Flop ETFs of the New Year).Buoyancy FlowingThe massive $1.5-trillion tax cuts will create an economic surge both domestic and international, boosting job growth and earnings of corporates. Additionally, jump in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat economic data added to the strength. Manufacturing activity, as measured by the Institute for Supply Management, climbed to the second-highest reading in six years while construction spending hit record highs in November with broad-based gains in both private and public outlays. Meanwhile, retail sales rose for the fourth consecutive month in December, capping the strongest year of sales growth since 2014.The market is anticipating that companies will come up with big gains in earnings and increased estimates for this year driven by tax cut savings. The Q4 earnings season is off to a strong start, with earnings of 26 S&P 500 companies that have reported results, up 13.6% from the same period last year on 9.1% higher revenues, with 73.1% beating EPS estimates and 80.8% beating revenue estimates. Overall, total earnings and revenues are projected to grow 9.2% and 7%, respectively (read: 4 ETFs & Stocks from Favorite Sectors for Q4 Earnings).However, the rally fizzled out later in yesterday’s trading session on concerns over the possible government shutdown. This represents the second drop so far this year. Congress needs to pass a spending bill by the end of Jan 19 to avoid a government shutdown. This pullback could be just a pause in the rally as traders took the chance to book some profits after a record run.Given the bullish fundamentals, the dips might charge up investors to snap up stocks and ETFs on the cheap for outsized gains in the coming weeks.How to Find Bargain ETFs?Using our database, first we have selected ETFs with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

1855,DHI,"Investors with strong risk appetite generally focus on momentum stocks for attractive returns. The Driehaus strategy isone such investment approach for those interested in momentum stocks. Richard Driehaus prepared this investing strategy using the “buy high and sell higher"" principle. The success of this policy eventually helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)• Last 5-year average EPS growth rates above 2% (Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business)• Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median (Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks)• Last four-quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5% (Positive EPS surprise indicates potential)• Positive % 50-day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks (High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend)• Momentum Score equal to or less than B (Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success)These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 7,855 stocks to only 29.Here are five of the 29 stocks:Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL  -  Free Report) is a financial and professional services company. It has a Momentum Score of A and an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 17.8%.Infinity Property and Casualty Corp.  is a provider of personal automobile insurance products.

1856,DHI,"Sales of previously owned homes increased in October for the second straight month, marking the best performance since June. However, low inventory is limiting the choice of prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated.Shares of prominent homebuilders such as D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), escalated yesterday after the release.October Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales increased 2% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.48 million units from 5.37 million in September. However, sales declined 0.9% from the year-ago level, marking the second consecutive year-over-year decline primarily due to shortage of supply. Moreover, the housing industry is yet to recover from the natural disaster that ravaged parts of Texas and Florida.Meanwhile, October’s median sales price grew 5.5% from the comparable period a year ago to $247,000, marking the 68th straight month of year-over-year gains.Again, inventory continues to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 3.2% from September and 10.4% from the year-ago period. It would take just 3.9 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR. This is also the lowest October reading since the group began tracking the data in 1999.Will the Momentum Continue?The U.S. housing industry is gradually recovering from damages caused by the recent hurricanes in the South. Again, limited land availability is driving prices higher. Apart from concerns over chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment. These are restricting homebuilders to respond to the growing demand.Besides, economists are of the opinion that a tax overhaul could add to the volatility in the market in the coming months. The measure would limit the mortgage-interest deduction on newly purchased homes at $500,000. This is quite a dramatic shift from the current cap of $1 million. The proposed capping of the mortgage-interest deduction could be damaging to pricier coastal markets that have been showing some strength in sales activity in recent times.Despite the above-mentioned woes, new residential construction in the United States increased more than expected in October 2017, reinstating strength in the housing industry. Per the latest jointly released report by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, constructions for new homes increased 13.7% in October 2017 to 1.29 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) from the prior month. This also marks the biggest surge in 12 months as housing starts witnessed big gains in single-family homes and apartments.Again, confidence among homebuilders rose in November to its highest reading in eight months to 70 and second-highest since the recession (July 2005), according to the Housing Market Index by the National Association of Home Builders (""NAHB"") and Wells Fargo.Bottom LineThe latest positive housing data undoubtedly reassures the industry’s strength courtesy of solid economic growth amid supply shortages and the ongoing recovery from hurricanes in Florida and Texas. Consistent job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders’ confidence is adding to the momentum.Moreover, a good industry rank (Top 21% out of more than 256 industries) for homebuilding further supports the growth potential. In fact, in the last three months, the Zacks Homebuilding Industry has widely outperformed the broader market (S&P 500), as you can see below:Major homebuilders such as KB Home, NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), TRI Pointe Group, Inc. (TPH  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers Inc. are well poised on the bullish fundamentals of the housing market.While, KB Home, NVR and TRI Pointe sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Toll Brothers carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1857,DHI,"Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has clinched a contract from Shell for the engineering, procurement and fabrication of Shell’s Penguins floating production storage as well as offloading (FPSO) vessel in the North Sea. The company will book the contract value in fourth-quarter 2017.Per the deal, Fluor has been assigned the task to design, fabricate as well as deliver the pre-commissioned FPSO to the North Sea. The FPSO will be designed to carry a production capacity of 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a storage capacity of 400,000 barrels. The FPSO is anticipated to operate 20 years uninterruptedly, without dry docking and would facilitate the extension of the life of the Penguins oil and gas fields. The project follows the company’s successful delivery of the Malampaya Phase 3 Project in Philippines and would be led by its Manila, Philippines office.Existing Business ScenarioFluor has an impressive track record of receiving awards, and management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in future as well.  Going forward, Fluor anticipates an increase in front-end engineering awards, which should help boost growth. Moreover, the company remains optimistic about investment projects, particularly on LNG projects in North America, chemical facilities and pipeline projects in the United States, as well as refining and chemical projects in the Middle East and Asia.The company is enjoying a healthy level of backlog in infrastructure, government, life sciences and advanced manufacturing, which has offset multi-year declines in mining, metals and oil & gas markets. Additionally, being an industry leader in nuclear remediation at government facilities throughout the United States, the company, is likely to benefit from the rising demand for energy globally.The long-term prospects of the company also remain strong with existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for existing coal-fired power plants. Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 36.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.8%.Despite these positives, volatility in commodity prices and the cyclical nature of the company’s commodity-based business lines, poses significant challenges for it in the upcoming quarters.  Going forward, it also believes that clients of Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment will maintain a cautious approach while taking investment decisions, which will add to the woes. This apart, the company is facing a dearth of engineering and new awards currently which has hurt growth prospects significantly.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) and NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report). While D.R. Horton sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Jacobs Engineering Group and NVR carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.D.R. Horton has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.0%.Jacobs Engineering Group has outpaced estimates in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 9.7%.NVR has surpassed estimates in the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 17.2%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1858,DHI,"The upcoming construction sector earnings results are expected to benefit from economic growth, the labor market, higher demand, tighter inventories and rising home prices. These positive factors are reflected in the improving estimates picture for the sector ahead of the major earnings releases starting next week.  After the solid 3.1% economic growth in the in the July-September quarter, the world’s largest economy is expected to have advanced 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, per the latest Atlanta Fed’s real-time Q4 GDP growth estimate. This solid upbeat projection holds particularly true when one of the nation’s key economic drivers, i.e. construction activity, is gradually strengthening its footprint accompanied by a declining unemployment rate (4.1% in December 2017).Construction Sector at a GlanceOverall, 2017 was a great year for the construction sector. The dynamic performance of the sector has been majorly buoyed by strong homebuilding activities and a rebounding U.S. economy. Spending on construction was up 4.2% year over year in the first 11 months of 2017, per the latest U.S. Census Bureau report. Although spending on government projects declined 3.4% during the period, homebuilding spending increased 6.6%.The sector has seen a strong year primarily on the back of robust gains from homebuilding investments. Although challenges in the housing industry persist in the form of low supply levels/limited listings, adverse impact of hurricanes as well as rising prices, factors like strong consumer confidence, favorable demographics, pent-up demand, job gains and income growth are outweighing the headwinds facing the sector.The latest data from the National Association of Realtors reveals that existing home sales for the month of November increased 5.6% to 5.81 million units in November to hit an 11-year high. Existing home sales, which account for 90% of home sales in the United States, surged 3.8% year over year in November.Meanwhile, the confidence level among the nation's homebuilders ended 2017 on a high note as the housing market index (HMI) was at 74 in December. This marks the highest reading since 1999.Disruptions caused by the hurricanes and other natural disasters seemed to be somewhat short-lived as revealed from recent economic data reports. Again, builders seem to have shaken off worries related to the Republican tax plan, and believe that the business incentives in the plan are likely to offset the negatives.A close look at the recently released financial numbers of the nation’s major homebuilders reveal the positive picture of this earnings season. KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) ended fiscal 2017 on an impressive note based on solid housing fundamentals. The homebuilder surpassed expectations in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 on both top and bottom lines. Again, Lennar Corporation’s (LEN  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.29 per share fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 by 14% and decreased 1.5% from the year-ago level of $1.31. Nonetheless, total revenues of $3.79 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 billion by 4.5%.Q4 ExpectationsMajority of the Zacks broad sectors (13 out of 16) are expected to be in the positive territory in the final quarter of 2017. For the construction sector, as far as estimates are concerned, the overall picture is indeed rosy in this earnings season. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the construction sector’s earnings are expected to increase 16.8% in the fourth quarter compared with 11.6% earnings growth witnessed in the third. Revenues too are expected to increase 10.5% (12.3% growth in Q3), while margins are expected at 0.4% (-0.1% in Q3).In spite of the inventory woes and higher land/labor costs, it is a profitable strategy to zero in on a handful of construction stocks that are poised to beat earnings this quarter. An earnings beat would also pave the way for stock price appreciation.Which Are the Right Picks?Picking the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a daunting task given the wide range of companies in the construction space. An easy way is to look at stocks that have a solid Zacks Rank accompanied by a favorable Earnings ESP.  The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive Earnings ESP usually hints at an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to pull a surprise in their next earnings announcement.

Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report). This Texas-based, one of the leading national homebuilders, topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 5.01%.

1860,DHI,"On Jul 14, we issued an updated research report on premium technical services company, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report).Over the last three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock yielded a return of 1.48%, as against 2.97% loss incurred by the Zacks categorized Engineering/R&D Services industry.Notably, the attractiveness of this stock as a current investment choice is further accentuated by its favorable Vale Growth Momentum Style Score ‘A’.Current PictureRise in construction spending in the U.S., as well as robust demand for building and infrastructure services in the Asian end markets are anticipated to bolster Jacobs’ revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, the company’s contract-based growth strategy will likely boost top- and bottom-line performances in the near term. For instance, over the last few months, Jacobs secured several contracts from renowned institutions and public-sector agencies like the U.S. Army, EQUATE Petrochemical Company, Florida's Turnpike Enterprise, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Codelco. Notably, higher transportation spending of the government authorities of Australia, the UK and the U.S. has increased Jacobs’ contract winning opportunities.  However, the company noted that the challenging conditions prevailing in the oil and gas market might continue to weigh over its Petroleum & Chemicals segment’s performance.In addition, we believe that headwinds such as stiff industry rivalry or adverse foreign currency translation impact might thwart the company’s growth, moving ahead.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock remained unchanged for both fiscal 2017 and 2018, reflecting neutral sentiments.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) has an average positive earnings surprise of 12.47% for the last four quarters and currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1863,DHI,"Shares of  TRI Pointe Group, Inc. (TPH  -  Free Report) have gained 28.1% over the last three months, substantially outperforming the 18.7% growth of its industry. Additionally, this Irvine, CA-based homebuilder, which mainly involves in the design, construction and sale of single-family homes, outperformed the industry in each of the four-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year’s earnings has increased 2.3% in the last 60 days, thus reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects and substantiating its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Meanwhile, earnings estimates have also moved north by 5.4% for 2018.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.What Makes TRI Pointe a Solid Pick?Stellar Third-Quarter Performance: Recently, the company came up with robust quarterly results with both top and bottom lines exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 1.2% and 6.7%, respectively. Also, the company’s earnings and revenues improved 118.2% and 23.2%, respectively, driven by 9% growth in home deliveries and 3% rise in average sales price of homes in the quarter.Importantly, the company’s backlog of $1.5 billion at the quarter end increased 56% from $950.2 million a year ago. Its new home orders were also up 36% year over year in the quarter on a 9% increase in average selling communities.TRI Pointe remains well positioned to outperform its peers through better absorptions and deliveries from the higher-margin California market.Solid Estimated EPS Growth: The homebuilder’s current-quarter earnings are expected to increase 77.8% year over year, comfortably outpacing the industry’s average projected growth of 16.7%. The company’s projected sales growth is a healthy 40.3%, higher than the industry average of 3.2%.Meanwhile, the company’s EPS growth is expected to increase 12.5% for the current year on 15.8% growth in revenues.In fact, for the company, nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels are often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains).Reasonably Valued Stock: Because of homebuilders’ asset-driven nature, it makes sense to value them based on price-to-book ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.44. This is quite cheap compared with the industry as well as the market at large, as the current P/B for the industry and S&P 500 is at 1.93 and 3.64, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning calls for an upside in the quarters ahead.Solid Industry Fundamental: Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose in September, hitting the highest level in nearly 10 years after reporting sales slump in recent months. Per the recently released report by the Commerce Department, new home sales surged 18.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 667,000 units in September amid an increase in all four regions. That was the highest level since October 2007 and followed August’s upwardly revised sales pace of 561,000 units.The housing/homebuilding industry has been riding high on steady job and wage growth, historically low mortgage rates and rapidly increasing household formation. The positive momentum is evident from the robust Zacks Industry Rank (Top 26% out of 256 industries).Consequently, homebuilding companies like TRI Pointe, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and others are expected to gain from such positive industry fundamentals and higher demand.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1864,DHI,"In line with its strategy of sustainable homebuilding, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) will now provide antimicrobial product protection — Microban  — for its interior door hardware selections.The company will be providing Microban antimicrobial product protection in association with long-time partner Kwikset, a leading residential lock manufacturer. Kwikset products with Microban protection incorporate an antimicrobial coating that prevents the growth of bacteria on door hardware.KB Home aims to offer sustainable and affordable homes, products and features that minimize homeowners’ carbon footprint and energy usage as well as conserve natural resources. The company’s sustainability initiative — started in 2007 — focuses on incorporating sustainable home features at little or no additional charge that could help lower the long-term cost for home owners.Under this eDifference platform, the company focuses on energy efficiency, water conservation, healthier indoor environment, smart home capability and waste reduction.Apart from providing sustainable features, the company’s Built to Order approach provides buyers the flexibility to design their own homes. In this approach, construction is initiated only after a purchase agreement has been executed. Such an approach appeals particularly to high-income consumers who enjoy the flexibility to design their homes and are ready to pay more for the same, thus driving the average selling price and revenues.Such innovative and sustainable features along with the Built to Order approach lend KB Home a competitive advantage over peers like D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), NVR (NVR  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report).If we look at KB Home’s recently released earnings, the company’s total revenues were $4.4 billion in fiscal 2017, up 21.5% year over year. Deliveries increased 11% and average selling price was up 9%.Also, KB Home’s four strategic initiatives are expected to drive profit and revenues further in 2018. These initiatives include boosting community count, achieving higher revenue per community, increasing asset efficiency and return on capital invested. The company focuses on profit per unit by improving cost efficiencies without compromising on the quality of products.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1865,DHI,"Recovering from the hurricanes, U.S. homebuilders’ confidence gained 4 points from the previous month in October, resulting in a confidence level of 68 — the highest since May 2017. Also, it improved from the year-ago figure of 63.The National Association of Home Builders or NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) includes builder perceptions of current single-family home sales, sales expectations for the next six months and traffic of prospective buyers. A reading above 50 is considered positive. Notably, all three HMI components gained in October.Though builders have recovered from uncertainties created by the hurricanes, labor shortage and higher material costs will continue to pose concerns. Builders need to be wary about the fact that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive material costs higher, causing delays.It is important to note that the index dipped 3 points in September from August but still remained at a confident level of 64 points. Thus, though the homebuilding industry might face some bottlenecks in the short term as is evident from the lackluster home sales data for the July-August period, the overall picture is pretty compelling.Housing got off to a solid start this year and the trend is expected to continue through next year, courtesy of healthy demand, strong economic growth, historically low mortgage rates, escalating rent costs and easy availability of loans.The Zacks Homebuilding Industry has outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) so far this year despite dampeners. The industry has gained 41.1%, compared with the S&P 500 index’s 14.2% increase. Notably, the homebuilding industry ranks among the top 29% of all Zacks industries. Along with a strong past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that companies in this space are likely to benefit from favorable broader factors. Major homebuilders like Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report),Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), to name a few, are well poised on the bullish fundamentals of the housing market. Lennar, D.R.

1866,DHI,"The Q3 earnings season is underway with major banks set to report this week. Earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 2.3% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues, as per the latest Earnings Trends.However, earnings growth is on track to be the lowest this year after double-digit growth in each of the first two quarters and with high single-digit expected earnings growth in the last quarter. This is especially true as twin attacks by hurricanes Harvey and Irma have taken toll on many industries such as insurance, energy, airlines and autos. Per Moody's Analytics, the two storms may lead to $150-$200 billion in damages (read: Hurricanes Impact on Earnings ETFs?).While earnings estimates for Q3 have declined from 6.3% at the start of the period, the magnitude of negative revision is lower than the recent quarters. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, seven are likely to be contributors to earnings growth, with energy leading the way.

Each of these ETFs and stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). For stocks, we have added the extra flavor of a positive Earnings ESP.

1867,DHI,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) finally closed the proposed acquisition of Austin-based Forestar Group Inc. , a residential and mixed-use real estate development company.With the completion of the transaction, the Texas-based homebuilder acquired 75% of Forestar’s stock at a cash price of $17.75 a share. Forestar’s board had said in June that it had agreed to the deal, which followed a brief bidding war between D.R. Horton and Connecticut-based Starwood Capital Group.D.R. Horton as well as Forestar will identify land development opportunities to boost Forestar’s platform in its current markets and across D.R. Horton’s national footprint. D.R. Horton has plans of taking over a major portion of the lots Forestar develops at market prices from newly identified land acquisition opportunities.Forestar owns interests in 49 residential and mixed-use projects comprising 4,400 acres of real estate spanning across 10 states and 14 markets.This buyout will give a meaningful percentage boost to D.R. Horton’s current holdings of 252,000 lots (owned and under control), as of June 2017. The company is on track to close 45,800 to 46,200 homes in fiscal 2017. The deal would add to D.R. Horton's fiscal 2018 earnings.Currently, rising land costs and a tight labor market are threatening homebuilders’ margins, thus hampering initiatives taken by them to tap the ongoing strength of the U.S. housing market. Limited capital for land and land development has created a shortage in supply, while growing demand drove prices. The labor market has also tightened with limited availability of workforce, arresting the rapid growth in housing production.Hence, the Forestar integration is in line with D.R. Horton’s long-term strategy of developing strong relationships with land developers across the country and growing the optioned portion of its land and lot position to enhance both operational efficiency and returns.On the other hand, the transaction has enabled Forestar to remain a public company, thus ensuring continued access to capital in order to support the increasing scale of the business. The deal will also help Forestar grow organically into a leading residential land development company in the country, by selling developed residential lots to D.R. Horton and other homebuilders.A Look at D.R. Horton’s Share Price PerformanceD.R. Horton’s shares have gained 48.6% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Homebuilding Industry’s growth of 40%. This price performance is backed by impressive earnings surprise history, as the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the past four quarters. The company remains committed toward achieving continued double-digit annual growth in both revenues and pre-tax profits, while generating positive cash flow and improved returns that can instill the upside potential for the stock further.Zacks Rank & Key PicksD.R. Horton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space are Persimmon Plc (PSMMY  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) and Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report).Persimmon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is likely to witness a rise of 18.3% in earnings.

1868,DHI,"Acuity Brands, Inc. (AYI  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.55 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.40 by about 6.3% and increasing 15.4% year over year on solid operating margin expansion.Including non-recurring items, the company reported earnings of $2.15 per share, up 14% from $1.89 a year ago.Full-year adjusted earnings came in at $8.45 versus $7.84 a year ago.Acuity Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Acuity Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Acuity Brands Inc QuoteSalesThe quarter’s net sales of $957.6 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $972.5 million by 1.5%. The reported figure, however, increased 3.5% year over year.The upside was mainly attributable to a 4.5% increase in volume, partly offset by a net unfavorable change in product prices and mix of products sold (price/mix) of approximately 1%. Sales volume improved across most key product categories and sales channels.Full-year net sales of $3,505.1 million increased 6.5% from the fiscal 2016 level.Operating HighlightsAdjusted gross profit margin was 42.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a decrease of 100 basis points (bps) year over year due to higher warranty expense and labor costs.Adjusted operating margin was 18.4%, up 150 bps year over year.Adjusted selling, distribution and administrative expenses were $230.6 million or 24.1% of quarterly net sales compared with $245.8 million or 26.6% a year ago. This was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expenses.FinancialsCash and cash equivalents, as of Aug 31, 2017, were $311.1 million compared with $413.2 million in fiscal 2016.Net cash provided by operating activities was $316.2 million in fiscal 2017, down 8.5% from $345.7 million a year ago.Notably, Acuity Brands completed the buyback of 2 million shares during fiscal 2017 under its previously authorized stock repurchase program at a total cost of $357.9 million.Acuity Brands expects some volatility in demand among certain sales channels and geographies, including possible short-term volatility due to the recent hurricanes that hit Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico. Nonetheless, it also expects the growth rate for lighting and building management solutions in the North American market, which includes renovation and retrofit activity and comprises more than 97% of its revenues, to be up low single digits for fiscal 2018, reflecting an expected rebound in the second half of the year.The company expects the North American lighting market to return to growth in fiscal 2018. It also expects to continue outperforming market growth rates by executing strategies focused on opportunities for new construction and renovation projects, expanding into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and introducing lighting and building management.Additionally, fiscal 2018 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 2% of net sales.Zacks RankAcuity Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Upcoming Releases in the Construction SectorPulteGroup, Inc.

1869,DHI,"After a busy week of new economic data — as well as speeches from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — last week, this week we look toward September employment metrics. The first of these will come out ahead of the opening bell tomorrow with the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector jobs totals for last month, followed by Friday’s all-encompassing non-farm payroll results from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Expectations are for roughly 150-160K new jobs for the month, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.4%.However, sometimes an earnings report from a particular company can illustrate the relative health of industries on a more macro-level, and this morning we see results from new home builder Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report). This company has now beaten earnings estimates for the seventh straight quarter, which is impressive. Other reads also point to a solid fiscal Q3 2017 (August), which include improved demand and higher price points along the way.Lennar is based in Miami, FL, which took an indirect hit from Hurricane Irma a month ago. However, we don’t see much negative impact in the company’s Q3 as a result; this will likely become more obvious in the company’s Q4 report (and possibly beyond). For a more extensive look at this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s earnings report, click here.Q3 earnings of $1.06 per share topped expectations by a nickel. Revenues in the quarter rose 15% year over year to $3.26 billion, ahead of the $3.22 billion in the Zacks consensus. A higher number than expected of new homes delivered was cited for the company’s outperformance.Lennar also saw an increase of 20 basis points on home sales gross margin, and financial services rose 12.3% year over year. Part of this came from very impressive multi-family home sales growth, up 26.7% from Q3 2016 to $103.4 million in the quarter. Further, expenses were ratcheted down a tad in Q3, with SG&A costs down 9.2% year over year.So what we see in microcosm here — and it will take reports from Lennar competitors such as D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) and Beazer Homes (BZH  -  Free Report) in weeks to come to flesh out these narratives — that the new home market is showing signs of growth. They look modest, but the numbers are all pointed in the right direction. And as new homes are bought by families currently in rental units and/or at home with Mom and Dad, this opens up availability for more consumers to enter those rental units. Those in starter homes may more easily upgrade to their “dream homes,” helping accelerate the cycle. This is especially important as the baby boomer generation decides to downsize to smaller homes and assisted living facilities.The pre-market is up again across the board, following a new set of all-time closing highs for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.

1871,DHI,"Sales of previously owned homes decreased in December 2017, as low inventory is limiting the choice of prospective buyers and keeping price growth elevated. Again, unseasonably cold weather also accounted for a bit of the downfall.December Existing Home Sales DataAs revealed by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), existing-home sales slipped 3.6% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.57 million units from a downwardly revised 5.78 million in November after three straight months of strong increases. Nonetheless, existing home sales, which account for about 90% of U.S. home sales, grew 1.1% on a year-over-year basis during the month.Also, December’s median sales price grew 5.8% from the comparable period a year ago to $246,800, marking the 70th straight month of year-over-year gains. For 2017, prices increased 5.8%, rising for the sixth straight year.Again, inventory continues to slip, leaving less homes for future sales. The supply of existing homes decreased 11.4% from November and 10.3% from the year-ago period. It has fallen year over year for 31 consecutive months. As such, it will take only 3.2 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market, according to NAR. This is also the lowest reading since the group began tracking the data in 1999.An Impressive 2017 for HomebuildingAlthough the December housing data were not impressive, the larger picture is overwhelming for 2017. Existing home sales concluded the year with 1.1% gain to 5.51 million units, the highest since 2006. Building permits increased 4.7% and housing starts increased 2.4% in 2017 from the 2016 figure. The industry advanced almost 69% in 2017, outperforming the broader market’s (S&P 500) growth of 19.7%.Moreover, January 2018 builders’ confidence reading remained in the 70s, signaling that housing demand should continue to grow this year.U.S. Housing Signaling a Positive 2018 Amid OddsAlthough inventory constraints have been consistently pulling the housing market down, robust demand is keeping the industry alive. This is primarily because of solid labor market that is near full employment.Other hurdles such as rising prices owing to the limited land availability are keeping the affordability in check. Again, homebuilders continue to struggle with growing labor shortage, higher material costs and a constrained mortgage environment.Market pundits are a shade worried that rising mortgage rates and caps on the deduction for mortgage interest following a recent overhaul of the tax code is likely to slow demand this year. That said, the latest report from the Mortgage Bankers Association, released on Jan 24, showed applications for loans to buy a home surging last week to their highest level since April 2010. Hence, despite concerns of chances of a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, that are restricting homebuilders to respond to the growing demand to some extent, the overall demand picture remains quite strong, courtesy of strong economic growth and low level of unemployment.Investing in the homebuilding industry might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 8% (20 out of 256 industries) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.Stocks to Bet onWe have identified five homebuilding stocks based on a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B.

This Zacks Rank #2 stock’s earnings are expected to witness 36.2% growth this year.D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank 2 and a Growth Score of B. The homebuilder’s current-year earnings are expected to grow 28.1%. This stock has climbed 67.2% in the last year, more than the industry.Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. Earnings for this leading homebuilder is expected to grow 34.9% this year. The stock has climbed more than 65% in the past year.Persimmon Plc (PSMMY  -  Free Report) has returned nearly 66% in the last year. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.

1872,DHI,"Shares of Century Communities, Inc. (CCS  -  Free Report) have rallied more than 28% in the last three months, outperforming the 18.7% growth of the Zacks Homebuilding Industry. Additionally, this homebuilder outperformed the industry in each of the four-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Moreover, earnings estimates have risen in the last few weeks, suggesting that sentiments on Century Communities are moving in the right direction. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings increased 7.3%. This signifies bullish analysts’ sentiment. Also, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term raise hopes. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Again, investing in the industry might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 11% (29 out of 256 industries) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth. The housing market has been going strong lately, courtesy of steady job growth and gradual economic recovery. What Makes Century Communities a Solid BetStellar Performance & Solid Growth Prospect: The company earned record levels of revenues, deliveries and backlog in its last reported quarter. Home sales revenues increased a record 51%, deliveries grew 37% to 968 homes, backlog (in value) increased 81% to $689.3 million. Overall, the company witnessed significant improvement across nearly all operating metrics in Q3.The company remains encouraged by the homebuilding momentum in both its legacy and new markets, which helped it in driving another quarter of meaningful year-over-year growth in net new contracts.Century Communities has attractive upside potential banking on management's impressive execution of its growth strategy, the benefits from recent acquisitions, and broader positive homebuilding momentum in the United States.The company’s 2018 earnings are expected to grow 72.3%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 26.9%. Century Communities’ revenues are expected to increase 29.2% in 2018 compared with the industry average growth of 10.1%.UCP Acquisition: In August 2017, Century Communities completed the acquisition of UCP, Inc. at an aggregate transaction value of approximately $359 million, expanding the company’s reach into 10 states.Again, in October 2017, Century Communities completed the bolt-on acquisition of the assets of Sundquist Homes, thereby further strengthening its presence and enhancing operating efficiencies in that market.The acquisition of UCP will help the company to reach in the states of California, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The combined company will operate in 10 states, 17 markets and 111 communities, with revenues of approximately $1.5 billion and inventories of $1.3 billion (as of Jun 30, 2017). The company remains optimistic and believes that this addition solidifies its position as the 16th largest public homebuilder in the United States. This transaction is expected to be accretive to 2018 earnings per share due to economies of scale, operational efficiencies and cost synergies.Undervalued Compared to Peers: The company currently has a trailing 12-month Price-to-Earnings or P/E ratio of 13.9. This compares favorably with its industry’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 18.3.Moreover, Century Communities has a forward P/E ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.4, lower than the industry’s P/E ratio of 12.4. So, it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors may also consider stocks like Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).For fiscal 2018, earnings for Lennar is expected to increase 34.9%.D.R. Horton is likely to witness an increase of 27.4% in earnings for the current fiscal year.KB Home is expected to witness 36.2% growth in earnings this year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce """"the world's first trillionaires,"""" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1873,DHI,"Gutsy investors with higher risk-taking propensity could go for momentum stocks that can yield impressive returns. In this context, the Driehaus strategy could be used to select the best momentum stocks using the “buy high and sell higher"" principle. The success of this investment approach helped Richard Driehaus secure a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)• Last 5-year average EPS growth rates above 2% (Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business)• Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median (Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks)• Last four-quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5% (Positive EPS surprise indicates potential)• Positive % 50-day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks (High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend)• Momentum Score equal to or less than B (Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success)These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 7,890 stocks to only 13.Here are four of the 13 stocks:Reinsurance Group of America, Inc. (RGA  -  Free Report) is involved in reinsurance business.

1874,DHI,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is expected to be strong, with earnings growth likely to pick up and continue accelerating after dipping in the preceding quarter. The S&P 500 index is anticipated to see earnings growth of 9.2% and revenue growth of 7%. The market is also at record levels, scaling series of highs at the start of the year.The forecast compares favorably with Q3 earnings growth of 6.7% on 5.9% revenue growth.

1875,DHI,"As we enter the Q4 reporting cycle, looking for stocks having unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for astute investors. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Parameters:In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we added the following parameters:Zacks Rank equal to 1 (Only Zacks' 'Strong Buys' are allowed.

Moreover, home deliveries are anticipated in the range of 7,000 to 7,300 units (previously 6,950-7,450) at an average price of $800,000-$825,000.ConcernsAlthough the current macroeconomic conditions are favorable for home buyers owing to a historically-low mortgage rate and a solid job market scenario, a shortage of buildable lots and skilled labor, escalating land prices, and higher material costs are exerting pressure on margins of Toll Brothers as well as other homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and others.In fact, Toll Brothers’ adjusted gross margin declined 30 basis points (bps) in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The company expects its adjusted gross margin in the range of 24.8-25% for fiscal 2017, marginally lower than the previous guidance of 24.8-25.3%.Nonetheless, a strong brand presence, a significant number of owned lots and a pricing power over competitors are likely to boost sales.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1881,DHI,"Two devastating hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — are taking a toll on homebuilders’ forecast for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) has reduced its fourth-quarter as well as fiscal 2017 forecasts due to delays caused by the recent tropical storms.Leading national homebuilder D.R. Horton now expects its backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 85% compared with the previously guided range of 88-90%. SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, is now estimated to be roughly 8.6% compared with 8.3-8.4% projected earlier.Importantly, the company radically trimmed its 2017 forecast for cash flow from operations due to delays caused by the catastrophes of late. D.R. Horton, which mainly sells single-family homes, now anticipates cash flow from operations of about $150 million for the fiscal year, down from the previous forecast of about $300 million.Not only D.R. Horton but another noted homebuilder Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) has also provided views recently regarding fiscal third-quarter deliveries and new orders, post the havoc of hurricanes. The company maintained that the natural disaster is anticipated to cause delays in home deliveries. Sad but true, the destructive hurricanes have affected Lennar’s communities across Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, representing 40% of the company’s annual homebuilding revenues.Per Atlanta-based homebuilder Beazer Homes USA, Inc.’s (BZH  -  Free Report) recent report, the company also expects new home sales and closings to be lower in the quarter ending Sep 30 on a year-over-year basis due to storm-related impacts.The latest U.S. housing data also reflects the ongoing weak sales pace. Existing home sales declined to a one-year low in August, per the latest report from National Association of Realtors or NAHB. Existing home sales slipped 1.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million. This marks the fourth decline in five months, bringing the annual rate to rock-bottom level in 12 months. Purchases in Houston dropped 25% year over year and sales would have been flat excluding the Harvey effect.Housing starts also came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million last month. This is 0.8% down from a revised July estimate of 1.19 million.Earlier this month, September readings gauging builders' view on sales over the next six months slipped from August. Economists are of the opinion that ongoing higher labor and material costs have already been hitting the industry hard. Also, inventory shortage has started taking toll on the sales’ pace. Now, scarcity of skilled construction labor is further anticipated to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays.Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.Nonetheless, homebuilders remain optimistic and expect post-disaster rebuilding efforts to drive higher demands for new homes next year.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1882,DHI,"U.S. housing data continued to tumble in August. Two devastating hurricanes, Harvey and Irma, along with ongoing higher labor and material costs have been hitting the industry hard. Also, inventory shortage has started taking its toll on sales’ pace.August Housing DataExisting home sales declined to a one-year low in August, per the latest report from National Association of Realtors or NAHB. Existing-home sales slipped 1.7% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million. This marks the fourth decline in five months, bringing the annual rate to the lowest level in 12 months. Purchases in Houston dropped 25% year over year and sales would have been flat excluding Harvey effect.Economists are of the opinion that the diminishing data reflects the inventory shortage prevailing in the U.S. real estate market. This has shot up average home prices nationwide. In fact, median sales price of existing homes rose 5.6% last month from a year earlier. Moreover, total housing inventory declined 6.5% year over year to 1.88 million, marking the 27th consecutive year-over-year decline. That’s just 4.5-month supply. Investors should note that it is more preferable to have about six months of supply for a healthy market.Further adding to the woes, housing starts came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million last month. This is 0.8% down from a revised July estimate of 1.19 million. Nevertheless, August construction starts were 1.4% higher year over year. Single-family starts were even stronger, growing 17.1% from a year earlier.Meanwhile, building permit, another economic indicator used to determine the health of the housing sector, increased sharply by 5.7% from the previous month with 1.3 million authorizations. Last month’s permit was also 8.3% above the August 2016 level of 1.2 million. According to Census Bureau data, the areas in Texas and Florida that were devastated by the storms accounted for about 13% of permits issued in the country last year.Investors should note that housing starts, permits and completions dropped 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.2%, respectively, in July. New U.S. single-family home sales also unexpectedly fell 9.4% in July, the lowest level since December 2016.Dipping Housing Data a Drag on Economic Growth in Q3?Earlier this month, September readings gauging builders' view on sales over the next six months slipped from August. Economists are of the opinion that shortage of skilled construction labor is expected to worsen following the two devastating storms and rebuilding operations are likely to drive construction costs higher causing delays. The construction sector was already witnessing labor shortage, only to worsen post the hurricanes. Rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report), Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) and others.That said, homebuilders' overall vision of the housing market remains positive. Strong job market, favorable demographics and low mortgage rates that make buying a home very affordable, should act as tailwinds. These positive factors are weighed down by the simple fact that there are just a few homes actually available to buy.The August housing data may have been weak due to Hurricane Harvey or Irma and the sales pace is expected to remain subdued through 2017 in the Houston area as well as in parts of Florida.Nonetheless, re-building efforts and the lost activity are expected to show up in 2018. As the hurricane-ravaged communities rebuild, activity could pick up, giving way to improving demand later this year and into next.Hence, this mixed report suggests that housing could remain a drag on economic growth in the third quarter.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1883,DHI,"Shares of Atlanta-based homebuilder Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (BZH  -  Free Report) have gained 35% over the last three months, substantially outperforming the 4.9% growth of its industry. Additionally, the company outperformed the industry in each of the four-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Beazer Homes expects new home sales and closings to be lower in the quarter ending Sep 30 on a year-over-year basis due to Harvey and Irma-related impact. That said, the company anticipates the impact to be temporary and remains confident about the substantial productivity gains in fiscal 2018. It also continues to expect an improvement in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter from the prior year.We believe higher earnings growth and improving industry conditions are likely to aid the stock in maintaining its solid performance in the quarters ahead.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year’s earnings increased 7.8% in the last 60 days, thus reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects and substantiating its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.What Makes Beazer Homes a Solid Pick?Solid Estimated EPS Growth: The homebuilder’s current-quarter earnings are expected to increase 69.7% year over year, comfortably outpacing the industry’s average projected growth of 45.4%. The company’s projected sales growth is a healthy 4.5%.Meanwhile, the company’s EPS is expected to decline 19.8% for the current year. Nonetheless, Beazer Homes is expected to show a stellar performance in fiscal 2018 with its bottom line expected to grow 53.5%, comfortably outpacing the industry’s expected 13.5% growth rate.Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels are often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company in question.Reasonably Valued Stock: Because of homebuilders’ asset-driven nature, it makes sense to value them based on price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 0.91. This is quite cheap compared with the industry as well as the market at large, as the current P/B for the industry and S&P 500 is 1.70 and 3.67, respectively. Its lower-than-market positioning indicates that there is room for an upside in the quarters ahead.Solid Industry Fundamental: The latest July housing data indeed reflects soft housing momentum for the time being. Nevertheless, the 2017 outlook for homebuilding seems to be solid given strong economic growth and labor market. The U.S. economy grew faster-than-anticipated in the second quarter (fastest pace in more than two years) and showed a significant jump from the first quarter’s lackluster 1.2% growth. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3% in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate on Aug 30. Along with this, solid homebuilders’ confidence (64 in September) raises optimism about the entire construction sector.The housing/homebuilding industry has been riding high on steady job and wage growth, historically low mortgage rates and rapidly increasing household formation. The positive momentum is evident from the robust Zacks Industry Rank (Top 22% out of 256 industries).Consequently, homebuilding companies like Beazer Homes, KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and others are expected to gain from such positive industry fundamentals and higher demand.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1885,DHI,"D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 9, before the opening bell.Recently, the company reduced its fourth-quarter as well as fiscal 2017 forecast due to delays caused by the recent tropical storms. D.R. Horton, one of the top builders in the United States, now expects its backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 85% compared with the previously guided range of 88-90%. This compares favorably with the year-ago level of 83%.SG&A (selling, general and administrative) expenses, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, is now estimated to be roughly 8.6% (versus 8.3-8.4% projected earlier). This also compares favorably with the year-ago level of 8.8%.Importantly, the company radically trimmed its 2017 forecast for cash flow from operations due to delays caused by the recent catastrophes. D.R. Horton, which primarily sells single-family homes, now anticipates cash flow from operations of about $150 million for the fiscal year, down from the previous forecast of about $300 million.Meanwhile, rising labor costs are threatening margins of noted homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Lennar Corp. (LEN  -  Free Report), KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL  -  Free Report) among others.In fact, D.R. Horton’s gross margin on home sales contracted 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 19.8% in the last reported quarter. Now, storm-related cost pressures are likely to create added pressure in the to-be-reported quarter. The company expects housing gross margin to be around 20%. In the year-ago quarter, it was 20.5%.Nonetheless, D.R. Horton remains optimistic and expects post-disaster rebuilding efforts to drive higher demands for new homes next year. Although challenges posed as a result of the recent hurricanes are bound to negatively impact its results to some extent in the fourth quarter, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario.Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically-low interest/mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation and a limited supply of inventory, bode well.Homebuilding, comprising about 97.6% of total revenues, is expected to get a boost in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $3.94 billion reflect growth of 6.9% sequentially and 7.9% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $97 million indicates an increase of 5.4% from the prior quarter and 7.4% year over year.Overall, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 9.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $4.04 billion, implying 8% year-over-year growth.D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  D.R. Horton, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | D.R.

In this, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

Price and Consensus  MasTec, Inc. Price and Consensus | MasTec, Inc. QuoteMasTec’s raised guidance for 2017 has also fueled this share-price appreciation. The company projected revenues at record levels of $6.3 billion for 2017 — 24% higher than the previous year. Annual adjusted EBITDA will climb 32% year over year, to be around $630 million. Adjusted earnings per share is projected at $2.80, a 47% jump over the $1.90 reported in 2016.Notably, MasTec has been awarded a number of large projects across multiple segments since the end of the last reported quarter.

In its wireline markets, fiber expansion continues to be a growth driver and the company projects strong nationwide fiber-deployment projects from telephone and cable TV companies which will provide it with significant opportunities over the coming years.In 2017, MasTec completed three acquisitions. In April 2017, the company acquired SEFNCO Communications to expand its capacity in the wireline/fiber deployment market. This will also considerably boost the company’s wireline-construction abilities in a geography where its customer exposure was limited.In the second quarter, MasTec acquired Cash Construction which will provide exposure to the growing water market. It also acquired a leasing company of Oil & Gas specialty pipeline equipment which will provide a competitive advantage during the current multi-year cycle of significant Oil & Gas pipeline project activity.Upward Estimate RevisionsMasTec’s positive estimate revisions reflect optimism in the company’s potential, as earnings growth is often an indication of robust prospects (and stock price gains). Estimates for the company moved up over the past 90 days, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments. The earnings estimate for 2017 has gone up 2.6%, while that of 2018 inched up 1.7%.The above-mentioned tailwinds have raised investors’ optimism on the stock and are anticipated to boost the company’s share price in the days ahead.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include D.R.

The top line also improved 17.7% year over year, driven by higher housing revenues.Segment DetailsHomebuilding Revenues: In the reported quarter, homebuilding revenues increased 17.7% year over year to $1.39 billion, driven by an increase in the number of homes delivered and average selling price or ASP. While land generated $7.97 million in revenues (up 145.5% from the year-ago quarter), housing revenues came in at $1.39 billion (up 17.4%).Net orders increased 2% to 2,296 homes, increasing across the board.

Meanwhile, SG&A ratio will likely be in the range of 11.7-12%.The company expects first-quarter housing gross profit margin in the range of 16-16.5%.

The downside was primarily due to the strategic shift of a transaction to the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Nonetheless, the company remains positive about the overall homebuilding market, solid demand for homes, favorable job market, and solid economy, along with the added tailwinds of recent tax law changes that will continue to propel the housing market forward.Total revenues of $3.79 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 billion by 4.5%.

The improvement was due to a decrease in external broker commissions as a percentage of revenues from home sales and improved operating leverage.Financial Services: Financial Services revenues increased 1.4% to $198.6 million in the quarter.

1889,DHI,"PulteGroup Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 30, before the market opens.Last quarter, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters, resulting in average earnings beat of 8.1%.Let us take a look at the factors that are likely to influence the company’s Q4 results.Healthy Housing Momentum to Boost RevenuesHealthy buyer demand and good traffic point toward a strong fourth quarter revenues for the company. Homebuilders, like PulteGroup have been doing well courtesy of steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically-low mortgage rates, rising rentals, rapidly increasing household formation, and a limited supply of inventory. Though housing industry data were not impressive last December, owing to an extreme cold weather, the industry reported robust gains in October and November. These positive trends point at strong demand in the to-be-reported quarter and beyond.Apart from positive industry fundamentals, we remain encouraged by PulteGroup’s prudent land investment strategy. The company expects to realize higher returns on invested capital, given the plans to moderate the rate of land spends, increase the use of land options where possible and accelerate inventory turns.Homebuilding revenues increased 11.7% in the first nine months of 2017. This segment revenue comprise of Home sale and Land sale revenues, both of which increased 11.6% and 78.2% in the first nine months of 2017. The trend is likely to continue in the fourth quarter as well, given the strong demand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Homebuilding revenues of $2.7 billion reflects growth of 30.9% sequentially and 9.4% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Home sale revenues reflects growth of 12% year over year but 15.6% decline for Land sale revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for closings stands at 6,547 units (up 5.6%) and that of average selling price is pegged at $415,000.On the other hand, consensus estimate for Financial Services revenues of $62 million indicates an increase of 32.1% from the prior quarter and 14.8% year over year.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $2.79 billion, implying 11.8% growth.Rising Costs Hurt MarginsRising land and labor costs are threatening margins, as they limit homebuilders’ pricing power. Home sales’ gross margin decreased 80 basis points (bps) year over year in the last quarter of 2017. PulteGroup expects gross margin in the lower end of 23.6-24.1% range, implying a decrease of 120 bps to 70 bps for the fourth quarter.Nonetheless, PulteGroup is taking actions to improve its operating and financial performance. These initiatives include improving overhead leverage, increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies. The initiatives are expected to drive meaningful profits for PulteGroup in the to-be-reported quarter.The solid improvement in the top line along with cost reduction program is expected to give a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at 84 cents, reflecting a 25.4% increase from the prior-year quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that PulteGroup is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.PulteGroup has an Earnings ESP of +2.01% and a Zacks Rank #2, which makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

1890,DHI,"The U.S. housing industry has just come off a great year. A last minute boost was the icing on the cake, with homebuilding optimism hitting a record level on the tax cuts announcement. In the first month of 2018, buyer demand and homebuilder optimism look strong. And these factors remain in place despite a disappointing read for housing starts for December.In fact, cumulative housing numbers for 2017 are quite impressive and indicate that another strong year for the industry is in the offing. Investing in stocks from the sector looks like an increasingly profitable option at this point.U.S. Housing Had a Great 2017According to real estate database firm Zillow, the value of U.S. housing stock as a whole increased by 6.5% or $2 trillion in 2017. This takes the total value of all homes located within the United States to $31.8 trillion. This increase in cumulative housing value was the fastest recorded since 2013, a time when the sector was still recovering from the Great Recession.As of now, Los Angeles is the most valuable housing market in the country, accounting for a total value of $2.7 trillion. Data from Zillow also reveals that New York comes in second with a cumulative value of $2.6 trillion.  In fact, the 10 most highly valued metro areas make up around 36% of the cumulative value of U.S. housing.This increase was primarily due to a spike in prices and a concurrent shortage in housing supply. According to real estate data provider Redfin, U.S. home prices increased by 7% over 2017 to a median sales price of $284,500.Meanwhile, sales registered a 1.7% increase over 2016 while only 2.6 months of supply was reported in December. Such a state of supplies indicates that the market is heavily skewed in favor of sellers.Prospects Remain Strong Although Starts DeclineMeanwhile, the year started with a disappointing reading for housing starts numbers. According to the Department of Commerce, housing starts declined by 8.2% in December, the largest percentage drop recorded since Nov 2016. However, industry watchers believe that the downturn experienced in December is likely to be temporary. Further, housing possibly felt the chill from December’s brutally low temperatures.Optimists point toward the 2.4% increase in homebuilding to 1.202 million units in 2017. This is the highest level recorded in a decade. Strong economic growth, a robust labor market and tax cuts are continuing to bolster the housing industry.Future demand is also likely to remain strong given the shortage in supply of existing homes. Also, homebuilders are not planning more speculative homes. These are units which still do not have a buyer. And this phenomenon has not been witnessed since the last housing boom which preceded the recession of 2008.  Our ChoicesIt would be best to ignore the recent poor reading of housing starts given that several positives remain in place for the sector. Homebuilding sentiment continues to linger near the 18-year high hit in December. Further, buyer demand remains high even as supplies constraints continue to exist, skewing the market heavily in favor of sellers. Taken together, these factors ensure that housing stocks remain a strong investment option in 2018.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

1891,DHI,"Vulcan Materials Company (VMC  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 financial numbers before the opening bell on Aug 2.Last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.87%. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the last four quarters, which more than offset the three earnings misses. This resulted in an average earnings beat of 4.24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlaySustained growth in private construction activity is expected to bode well for demand of both the aggregates and non-aggregates business lines. Further, prospects for higher funding levels and easy regulatory environment might prove beneficial for the company with respect to idled projects. Overall, key Vulcan states that make up 77% of its total revenue have significantly increased their highway funding. Again, Texas, Florida and Georgia have made major increases to their funding programs in recent years, raising their highway programs to record levels. This will help the company to boost its revenue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, any slowdown in activity related to weather on some parts of the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic region might impact Vulcan's results.The company’s aggressive cost-control initiatives, strong aggregate reserve position, and pricing power are likely to contribute in the second quarter.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.24 per share, reflecting an increase of 37.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is $1.08 billion, implying a 12.8% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Vulcan is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.

1893,DHI,"NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 24. A healthy housing industry and strong demand trends should drive the company’s performance.Factors At PlayMuch like other homebuilders, NVR is positioned to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, historically-low mortgage rates, rising rentals and rapidly increasing household formation point at strong demand.Homebuilding revenues increased 10.1% year over year in the first three quarters of 2017, primarily on a 7.8% year-over-year increase in the number of settled units. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as is evident from the company’s solid backlog. As of Sep 30, 2017, backlog of homes increased on a unit basis by 16% and on a dollar basis by 15% to $3.44 billion.  Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $1.98 billion, implying a year-over-year rise of 15.3%.Moreover, the company focuses on its disciplined business model, based on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risk. Unlike other homebuilders, NVR’s sole business is selling and building quality homes by typically acquiring finished building lots, without the risk of owning and developing land in a cyclical industry. The cash generated is thus used to expand its business while returning excess capital to shareholders through buy-back programs.Again, with a modest rise in pricing and moderated construction costs, NVR was able to witness gross margin expansion of 230 basis points (bps) in the third quarter, 220 bps in the second quarter and 30 bps in the first quarter of 2017. The trend is expected to be maintained in the quarter to be reported as well.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $48.95 per share, reflecting a 29.5% year-over-year increase. The company also surpassed estimates in all of the last four quarters, with the average surprise being 17.3%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NVR is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to surpass estimates.For NVR, however, this is not the case as is listed below —Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.74%.

1894,DHI,"United Rentals, Inc. (URI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 25, after market close.Synergies from the Neff Corporation acquisition are expected to reflect in fourth-quarter 2017 earnings. The company completed the buyout for approximately $1.3 billion last October. The buyout will enhance the company’s earthmoving equipment capabilities and efficiencies of scale in key markets. As part of the deal, United Rentals acquired approximately $860 million worth of fleet based on original equipment cost and 69 branch facilities. The company expects revenues from Neff in the fourth quarter of about $110 million, and EBITDA at around $55 million from Neff alone.Let’s delve deeper into other factors that are likely to affect the company’s Q4 earnings.In the third quarter, the company posted positive rental rates after eight straight quarters of negative rates. We expect the fourth-quarter results to reflect positive rental rates as well. Factors such as strong organic growth led by improving end-market demand and the NES acquisition are likely to help the company see an improvement in rates.Equipment Rentals, comprising about 86% of total revenues, is expected to get a boost in fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equipment Rentals revenues of $1.6 billion reflects sequential growth of 6.3% and year-over-year rise of 25.7%.The consensus estimate for rental equipment sales is $143 million, indicating an increase of 5.9% from the prior quarter. Again, sales of new equipment are expected to increase 12.5% on a year-over-year basis. Contractor Supplies revenues will likely witness 6.8% growth and Service and Other revenues are expected to rise 18.3%.Project XL initiatives, prudent investments in fleet, accretive acquisitions and robust market demand enhance United Rentals’ prospects.Moreover, the company has been experiencing growing demand in its core construction and industrial sectors. Commercial construction has been strong of late. Upstream oil and gas is also gaining traction on improving macro conditions. Thus, demand for United Rentals’ products is expected to increase, thereby driving revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1.88 billion in the said quarter, up 23.3% from the year-ago quarter.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and 2017 earnings has improved in the last 30 days. Estimates for the fourth quarter moved up 0.9% to $3.34. The consensus mark for 2017 depicts an increase of 4 cents to $10.60.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 reflects year-over-year growth of 25.1% and 22.5%, respectively.United Rentals, Inc.

1896,DHI,"All eyes are currently on the crucial two-day FOMC meeting slated to start today. The central bank is expected to hold rates steady and lay out plans to unwind its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. It will likely reduce bond holdings by a maximum of $50 billion per month, or $600 billion per year.Both the latest Bloomberg survey and Reuters’ poll reveal that the Fed will unveil the timing of its balance sheet unwinding in September and wait until December to raise interest rates again. As such, rate sensitive ETFs are in vogue (read: Fed to Tighten Policy: Bet on These ETFs).In the latest testimony, Fed Chair Janet Yellen stated that she is not in a rush to raise interest rates and will continue to follow a gradual rate hike plan given the lower inflationary pressure. U.S. consumer price remained flat in June against the expectation of a 0.2% increase, signaling doubts over the third rate hike this year. This represents year-over year growth of 1.6%, the smallest gain since October 2016, after a rise of 1.9% in May.  Per the central bank, interest rates are close to the neutral level – a level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity. The current target for the funds rate is 1-1.25% while inflation is around 1.4%, implying that the real rate is close to zero, according to CNBC (read: Dovish Yellen Testimony to Boost These ETFs).The Fed’s dovish view and dimming prospect of rates hike in the near term has pushed Treasury yields lower, which in turn is benefiting rate-sensitive and high-yield sectors such as utilities and real estates. Additionally, the ongoing turmoil in Washington and growing geopolitical concerns are making investors jittery, raising the appeal for these sectors. This is because these sectors act as a safe haven in times of market turbulence and concurrently offer higher returns due to their outsized yields.As a result, investors could make a near-term play on rate sensitive sectors in the basket form, as these will continue to trade smoothly if interest rates remain steady. Below we have highlighted some ETFs from these sectors that could be excellent plays ahead of the Fed’s decision:iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF (REM  -  Free Report)This is the most popular mortgage REIT ETF with AUM of $1.4 billion and average daily volume of around 304,000 shares. It tracks the FTSE NAREIT All Mortgage Capped Index and holds 33 securities in its basket with large allocations to the top two firms – Annaly Capital (NLY  -  Free Report) and American Capital Agency (AGNC  -  Free Report) – that collectively make up for 26.6% share while other securities hold less than 7.4% share. The fund charges 48 bps a year as fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or ‘Hold’ rating with a Medium risk outlook.Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU  -  Free Report)With AUM of $7.6 billion, this fund provides exposure to a small basket of 30 securities by tracking the Utilities Select Sector Index. It is heavily concentrated on the top four holdings at 32.5% of assets. Electric utilities takes the top spot in terms of sectors at 62.1%, closely followed by multi utilities (33.1%). The product charges 14 bps in annual fees and sees a heavy volume of more than 12.5 million shares on average. XLU has a Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or ‘Sell’ rating with a Medium risk outlook.iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report)This fund provides a pure play to home construction stocks by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index. It holds a basket of 45 stocks with double-digit allocation going to the top two firms – DR Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) and Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report). Other firms hold not more than 9.3% of assets. Homebuilding takes the top spot at 66.1%, followed by 14.9% in building products and 7.9% in home improvement retail.

It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 or ‘Strong Buy’ rating with a High risk outlook (read: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Tap Q2 Earnings Growth).First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (FXG  -  Free Report)This ETF provides exposure to 40 consumer staples stocks by following an AlphaDEX methodology and ranks stocks in the space by various growth and value factors, eliminating the bottom ranked 25%. It is moderately concentrated on various components with none holding more than 5.16% share.

1897,DHI,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (MLM  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 8.1%. However, the company missed estimates in three of the past four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 2.78%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMartin Marietta’s prospects are getting marred by weather-related risks despite improving economic conditions, cost management and enhanced operational efficiency. Abnormally wet weather conditions in many markets can affect production schedules and profits to a large extent.However, the company’s string of acquisitions, divestitures and an uptick in private and public construction activity are encouraging. Sustained growth in construction activity drives the demand for both the aggregates and cement businesses of the company. This can be expected to benefit results in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.38, reflecting a 25.3% year-over-year increase. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.01 billion, reflecting 10.1% growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Martin Marietta this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $2.38. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

1898,DHI,"D.R. Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), one of the biggest and well-known homebuilders in the nation, came up with upbeat fiscal third-quarter 2017 results on July 26 before the bell. Both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate (read: Is Spring Selling Season Opening Room for Housing ETFs?).However, its slowest order growth in three quarters diluted the impact of the earnings beat. Along with this, easing momentum in the U.S. new home sales segment made matters worse. Shares fell about 1.9% post earnings release.Let’s take a look inside the headline numbers:The company reported earnings of $0.76 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.75. Earnings grew 15.2% year over year driven by higher home sales. Total revenue (homebuilding and financial services) of $3.78 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.71 billion by 5.2%. Total revenue also increased 16.8% year over year (read: Sector ETFs & Stocks to Tap Q2 Earnings Growth).Homebuilding revenues of $3.68 billion increased 17% year over year, helped by higher home deliveries. The company registered growth across all the regions comprising East, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, Southwest and West.Inside Home Sales in JuneNew U.S. single-family home sales rose for the second successive month in June with purchases in the West skyrocketing to about a 10-year high. However, downward revisions to sales growth for the previous three months hinted at cooling of the housing market.May's sales pace was cut down to 605,000 units from the previously reported 610,000 units while June recorded a 0.8% increase to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000 units. With this, sales in June missed economists’ prediction of 1.4% growth to 615,000 units.To add to the woes, homebuilder confidence plunged to an eight-month low in July, indicating no meaningful recovery in the already under-pressure home inventory market. If this was not enough, existing home sales fell more than expected in June on less availability of properties that shot up prices.Market & ETF Impact The subtle bearishness over such an important homebuilding stock may cause a slack in housing ETFs over the coming days. Overall improvement of the housing sector also seems to be rocky as evident from home sales data (read: Rate Sensitive ETFs in Focus as Fed Meets).However, the Fed remained dovish and yields are on the lower side at the current level. This may work wonder for the sector. Investors should also note that the sector is well positioned from the Zacks Rank point of view. The Zacks Industry Rank of DHI is in the top 8% at the time of writing and the Zacks Sector Rank is in the top 25% (read: Foreign Investment in U.S. Housing Surges: ETFs to Buy).Housing ETFs mainly include SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB  -  Free Report) and iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report). DHI takes first spot in the 45-stock ITB with a 12.41% weight and the first position in the 37-stock XHB with 4.87% exposure.In a nutshell, investors who want to bet on the Fed’s dovishness but worried about dull order growth at D.R. Horton, may easily take the ETF route for investing. This is because a basket approach always safeguards investors from stock-specific volatility. ITB was down about 0.8% on July 26, while XHB was down about 0.03%.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Also, the company surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 4.03%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLike other homebuilders, D.R. Horton is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.71 billion, implying an 14.8% rise.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that D.R. Horton is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1904,DHI,"Leading homebuilders like D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM  -  Free Report) have been riding high on affordable mortgage interest rates, pent-up demand, employment gains, income growth and favorable industry trends. The home building industry has a solid Zacks Industry Rank (top 14% out of 256 industries). The industry has outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) so far this year as well.Meanwhile, the July existing-home sales were down 1.3% from June owing to low supply and increased prices. Nevertheless, July’s sales pace is 2.1% higher than a year ago. Again, improving labor markets, falling unemployment rates and a limited home supply are supporting a continued rise in home prices, thereby boosting homebuilders’ top line.Among the top performers, since D.R. Horton and PulteGroup are in close competition, let us analyze the factors to determine which company is a better investment option in this macroeconomic scenario. Since both the companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we need to delve deeper into factors beyond rank.Price PerformanceD.R. Horton has gained 29.1% so far this year, while PulteGroup’s shares have increased 37.7%. That said, we noticed that both the companies have outperformed the industry in each of the 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames, earning a Momentum Score of B. While both the stocks have also outperformed the S&P 500 average so far, PulteGroup clearly scores higher than D.R. Horton.D.R. Horton Vs. IndustryPulteGroup Vs. IndustryEstimate RevisionsPulteGroup’s current year estimate revisions have been discouraging with estimates decreasing from $2.18 a share to $2.09 over the last 60 days.D.R. Horton’s current year figures look quite promising. For fiscal 2017, 12 estimates have moved higher for D.R. Horton while four have gone lower in the past 60 days. The consensus trend has been pretty favorable too, with estimates increasing 1.1% from $2.75 a share to $2.78 over the last 60 days. D.R. Horton expects to perform reasonably well in fiscal 2017 and 2018 on the back of its robust backlog position and well-stocked inventory of land, lots and homes.Earnings GrowthPulteGroup has remarkably beaten earnings estimates in five of the trailing six quarters, recording an average beat of 11.5%. D.R. Horton on the other hand surpassed estimates in four of the last six quarters at an average of 4.7%.PulteGroup makes a better pick in terms of growth investment. Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels are often an indication of strong prospects.While PulteGroup has a historical EPS growth rate (average trailing 12-month EPS growth rate over the last 3-5 years of actual earnings) of 40.7%, D.R. Horton has registered historical EPS growth of 16.8%. The industry registered historical EPS growth of 28.5%.Coming to current year’s EPS growth, PulteGroup is looking to grow at a rate of 23.8% more than D.R. Horton’s 17.6%.Meanwhile, their industry calls for EPS growth of 17.9%. PulteGroup’s investments in the acquisition of new land positions result in improved volumes, revenues and profitability.Revenue GrowthPulteGroup sales growth in 2017 is projected to be about 15.7% almost on par with D.R. Horton’s projected rate of 16.4%, both more than the industry’s average of about 8%.Apart from prudent capital allocation, PulteGroup is taking actions to improve its operating and financial performance. The initiatives include improving overhead leverage, increasing inventory turns and implementing new pricing strategies. These initiatives have enabled PulteGroup to drive revenues.D.R. Horton is confident about the rest of fiscal 2017, courtesy of 27,600 homes in inventory at the end of June and a robust supply of lots. The company lifted its fiscal 2017 view for total revenues, homes delivered and overall pre-tax profit margin. The company maintains a positive outlook for revenues and profits, both of which are expected to increase double digits, annually.Valuation MetricsGoing by the trailing 12-month Price-to-book (P/B) multiple, both stocks are a tad overvalued, as is evident from their P/B ratios compared with that of the industry’s. P/B ratios for PulteGroup and D.R. Horton are 1.69 and 1.78, respectively, while the industry’s stands at 1.19. PulteGroup’s stock is slightly cheaper than D.R. Horton’s.Land Investment StrategyD.R. Horton invested $2.8 billion in lots, land and development in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, compared with $2 billion a year ago. The company plans to boost investments to replenish its land and lot supply in 2017 to support revenue growth. It has selectively invested in attractively-priced land and lots in the past two years allowing it to bring new attractive communities in desirable markets. D.R. Horton’s well-stocked supply of land, plots and homes provide it with a strong competitive position to meet the demand in future quarters, thereby growing sales and home closings.In the second quarter of 2017, PulteGroup invested approximately $236 million in the acquisition of new land positions.  For the first quarter, land investments totaled $566 million, excluding the purchase of John Wieland assets. PulteGroup’s land strategy now emphasizes on investing in shorter-lived smaller land assets while expanding the use of land option agreements when possible, thereby mitigating market risk. It also focuses on investing in land where demand is more sustainable and hence they generate better returns.Final ThoughtsGoing by the above factors, PulteGroup certainly has an edge over D.R. Horton in terms of earnings growth expectations, price performance and valuation. Add, favorable industry trends and a VGM Score of B to this, we believe that we have a good investment proposition in PulteGroup.Other Key PicksApart from PulteGroup, investors interested in the homebuilding industry may also consider NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1908,DHI,"Shares of Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report) have gained 22.7% in the last three months, outperforming the 17.6% growth of its industry. Additionally, this leading homebuilder outperformed the industry in each of the four-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames. The overall outlook for the homebuilding industry remains positive, with healthy economy, strong job market and historically low mortgage rates, and the companies are cashing in on this positive momentum.Again, investing in the industry might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 7% (17 out of 256 industries) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for both fiscal 2018 and 2019 have increased 9.1% and 14.9%, respectively, in the last 30 days for Lennar, thus further reflecting optimism in the stock’s prospects and substantiating its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.What Makes Lennar a Solid BetStellar Performance & Upbeat Outlook: After a strong performance in 2014, 2015, and 2016, Lennar once again delivered outstanding operating results in fiscal 2017. Thanks to strong demand, Lennar’s total revenues grew 15% year over year in fiscal 2017 on the back of a solid 15% rise in homebuilding revenues. This was primarily driven by a 11% increase in the number of home deliveries and a 4.1% rise in the average sales price of the homes delivered.The company was successful in meeting its target of achieving the lowest SG&A percentage in its history in 2016 and repeated it in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, SG&A expenses contracted to 9.2% in the fiscal 2017, from 9.4% in the year-ago period due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries.The company maintained its 7% to 10% growth target and is focused on cutting down operating costs, in order to drive bottom line and cash flow. In its recently released fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 results, Lennar witnessed robust market improvement, which was supported by 11% year-over-year increase in its new home orders (up 18% in dollars).The company remains positive about the overall homebuilding market in 2018 too, banking on solid demand for homes, favorable job market, and solid economy, along with the added tailwinds of recent tax law changes that are expected to continue propelling the housing market forward.Impressive Expected Earnings & Revenue Growth: Possibly, nothing is more important than earnings growth.On this front, Lennar has put up a historical (three-five year) EPS growth rate of 24.1%, in line with the industry average.The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to grow 38.6%, while the Zacks Homebuilding Industry’s earnings are likely to increase 26.8%. Lennar’s revenues are expected to increase 12.6% in the current year compared with the industry average growth of 10.1%, thereby making it a great pick in terms of Growth investment. The stock has a Growth Score of B.The company’s EPS growth is expected to increase 13.8% the next year on 8.5% growth in revenues.CalAtlantic Acquisition: In Oct 2017, Lennar agreed to take over CalAtlantic Group Inc.  in a $9.3 billion deal (including debt), which will give birth to one of the country’s top three home builders in 24 of the top 30 U.S. markets. CalAtlantic investors would own approximately 26% of the combined entity upon the deal's expected closing in February 2018.Miami, FL-based Lennar has a large footprint in California, Arizona, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, Nevada and elsewhere. CalAtlantic has presence in Illinois, Indiana, Delaware, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and other states.By combining, Lennar and CalAtlantic Group will control nearly 240,000 homesites nationwide, thereby enhancing their scales in the markets. The combined company will have a footprint touching approximately 50% of the U.S. population and the combined entity is expected to generate meaningful cost savings.The deal is expected to generate roughly $250 million in annual cost savings, with about $75 million in savings expected in fiscal 2018. The savings include lower overhead costs and elimination of duplicative corporate expenses.Solid VGM Score and ROE: The company has an impressive VGM Score of B. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth, and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 make solid investment choices.Lennar’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. ROE in the trailing 12 months is 12.2%, while the industry gained 10.8%, reflecting the company’s efficient usage of shareholders’ funds.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors may also consider stocks like D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1.D.R. Horton is likely to witness an increase of 27.1% in earnings for the current fiscal year.KB Home is expected to witness 34.1% growth in earnings this year.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1909,DHI,"After two months of robust gains, housing starts and permits results were not impressive last December. Per the latest jointly released report from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, housing starts decreased 8.2% in December 2017 to 1.92 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) from the prior month owing to a 11.8% drop in single-family housing starts. This also marks the highest drop since November 2016 owing to colder than normal temperatures in some parts of United States.Residential building permits, an indicator of upcoming construction activity, decreased 0.1% in December to an annualized rate of 1.3 million units from November. Single-family home permits increased 1.8%, while that for the construction of multi-family homes decreased 4.3%.Moreover, the confidence level among the nation's homebuilders slipped slightly in the first month of 2018 after reaching an 18-year high in December 2017, according to the National Association of Home Builders’ (NAHB) Housing Market Index.The January 2018 reading was down two points to 72 from the December level of 74. Notably, all three Housing Market Index (HMI) components slipped slightly. Current sales conditions decreased one point to 79. Buyer traffic decreased four points to 54 and sales prediction over the next six months slipped one point to 78.Is It Really a Concern?The latest disruption is not really a concern as it is more likely because of an extremely cold winter. The larger picture is still overwhelming with building permits increasing 4.7% in 2017 and housing starts rising 2.4% over the 2016 figure. Moreover, a builders confidence reading in the 70s range is considered confident enough. Therefore, it is not necessary to pay heed to the current decline in data.Investors can be fairly confident about the housing sector’s performance in 2018 on an improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs.After the solid 3.1% economic growth in the July-September quarter, the world’s largest economy is expected to advance 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, per the latest Atlanta Fed’s real-time Q4 GDP growth estimate. This solid upbeat projection holds particularly true when one of the nation’s key economic drivers, i.e. construction activity, is strengthening. Also, a declining unemployment rate (4.1% in December 2017) is encouraging.Though the U.S. housing industry is gradually recovering from damages caused by the recent hurricanes, limited land availability, labor shortage and higher material costs, there is nothing to fret about. Also, despite a probability of mortgage rate hikes in 2018, optimism surrounding the housing market remains largely unaffected.How is the Sector Placed?The Zacks Homebuilding Industry has advanced 70.4% in the past year, comparing favorably with 24% growth of the broader market (S&P 500). Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 6% out of more than 250 industries) supports the growth potential of the stocks in this industry.  Moreover, this industry’s three-five year expected earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 16.3% is better than the broader market’s 9.7%.Major homebuilders like KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report), Lennar Corporation (LEN  -  Free Report), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) and NVR, Inc. (NVR  -  Free Report), to name a few, are well poised on bullish fundamentals of the housing market.While KB Home, Lennar and D.R. Horton sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), NVR carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1910,DHI," Welcome to Episode #74 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.This is the last podcast of 2017. That means it’s a great time to look back at what worked, and what didn’t, this year.And while growth stocks had a phenomenal year, it wasn’t all bad for value stocks either.The Hottest Value Stocks of 2017 Two industries, the semiconductors and the homebuilders, had magical years and they also happened to be mostly value stocks throughout 2017.The Semiconductor ETF SOXX has gained about 41% year-to-date while the SPDR Homebuilders ETF XHB is up roughly 30%. If you were in the iShares US Home Construction ETF ITB you’re up even more, gaining 56%.Those are extraordinary gains in an extraordinary year for stock investors.But what will happen to stocks in those two industries in 2018?Are they still values? And can they keep the momentum?The Homebuilders are Still out of FavorThe homebuilder stocks don’t get any love from mom and pop investors, even though they have soared in 2017. That’s a bullish sign for 2018.Here are two homebuilder stocks that are still cheap and have attractive earnings growth.1.     DR Horton (DHI  -  Free Report) is up 85% year-to-date but still trade with a forward P/E of just 16. It’s one of the largest homebuilders, with a $19 billion market cap. Earnings estimates are on the rise over the last 2 months. Earnings are expected to grow 17.4% in fiscal 2018 and another 14.6% in fiscal 2019.2.    TRI Pointe Group (TPH  -  Free Report) united 6 home building brands after the housing bust to build homes in 8 states. It’s now one of the 10 largest homebuilders in America. Despite shares soaring over 55% on the year, TPH still trades with a forward P/E of just 13.5. It’s expected to have double digit earnings growth in 2018.Is the Semiconductor Cycle Peaking?No sector was hotter, in either growth or value, than the semiconductors in 2017.But the question plaguing the industry heading into 2018 is if the cycle has peaked. Historically, when demand outstrips supply, the industry has ramped up production so much that it has brought down prices.But Micron recently reported earnings and it said it still saw demand outstripping supply through 2018.The semiconductors, despite their incredible gains in 2017, are still dirt cheap.3 Semiconductor Stocks for 20181.     Micron (MU  -  Free Report) reported another solid quarter in December 2017. Earnings are expected to rise 98% in fiscal 2018. With the sharp increase in the earnings estimates, it’s now trading with a forward P/E of just 4.3. Whoa.2.    Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report) is often overlooked by investors probably because its headquartered in Pennsylvania. Yet earnings are expected to rise 66% in 2017 and another 6% next year. It’s still cheap, with a PEG ratio of only 0.7.3.    Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) is still expected to see earnings growth of 47% in fiscal 2018. Shares are still a value with a forward P/E of just 12.5 and a PEG of 0.9. Investors even get a 1% dividend yield.Neither of these industries are showing the signs of being value traps. On the contrary. Both continue to see rising earnings estimates, not declining.While it’s hard to buy in after a big run like they’ve had in 2017, the valuations are still attractive. Remember, to do your research before jumping into any stock.What else should you know about these two hot industries?Tune into this final Value Investor Podcast of 2017 to find out.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1911,DHI,"As we bid adieu to 2017, let’s take a look at how the construction sector fared this year and what’s in store for 2018.Overall, 2017 was a great year for the construction sector buoyed by robust gains from home building investments and a rebounding U.S. economy. Especially, optimism surrounding the construction sector grew manifold post President Donald Trump’s victory, since one of his key priorities was driving infrastructure investments. This optimism is likely to continue in the near term, thanks to the long-awaited tax cuts, which are likely to be passed this week.In total, spending on construction increased 4.1% year over year in the first 10 months of the year, per the latest report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Although spending on government projects declined 3.4% year to date, it grew 3% in October, the biggest one-month gain in three years, with spending at the federal, state and local levels rising. Government project spend is expected to increase in 2018 with the Trump administration’s $1-trillion infrastructure spend program, which is yet to materialize. On the other hand, residential spending increased 6.6% in the first 10 months of 2017. While a few projects like multifamily housing are gradually losing ground, others like office buildings, education facilities, and transportation terminals are in high demand.Insights Into the Sector’s Prospects for 2018U.S. construction starts are expected to climb slightly in 2018, according to Dodge Data & Analytics’ 2018 Dodge Construction Outlook. A 3% increase to $765 billion is expected, following a similarly modest 4% rise to $746 billion, is estimated for 2017.The forecast further entails 3% increase in public works construction spending, higher than 1% growth in 2017. Highways and bridges projects are likely to get a boost as federal funding is rising owing to the FAST Act. Again, reconstruction efforts related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma are also adding to the expectations.Also, residential construction activities stepped up this year and the trend is expected to continue in 2018, courtesy of improving economy, modest wage growth, low unemployment levels, positive consumer confidence, a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs. Per the study by Dodge Data & Analytics, 4% gain is expected for residential building, 2% for nonresidential building, while nonbuilding construction is expected to stabilize following two years of decline.However, a few market pundits are of the opinion that the Trump administration’s efforts toward overhauling the tax code could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market and make housing less attractive. The GOP tax bill allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to $750,000, down from the current $1 million.That said, the December reading of the confidence level of homebuilders speaks of the industry’s strength. The confidence level among the nation's homebuilders ended 2017 on a high note as the housing market index (HMI) was at 74 in December. This marks the highest reading since 1999.Builders seem to be shaking off worries related to the Republican tax plan, and apparently believe that the business incentives in the plan are likely to offset the negatives. The legislation promises many practical changes in a number of areas, but it will surely have a major positive impact on corporate profitability.Per the Zacks Earnings Trends, earnings for the construction sector are likely to witness 20.3% growth in 2018, up from the expected 14.9% increase in 2017. Revenues are likely to improve 9% in 2018, compared with 9.5% growth estimated for 2017.Strong Economy and Labor Market Act as CatalystTrump had vowed to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring tax cuts, deregulation and higher infrastructure spending. Both markets and investors responded positively to this. The aura exists, as is evident from the broader market’s performance.The S&P 500 index topped the milestone of 2,500 for the first time in mid-September, surpassing the 266% rise during the 1949-56 run, per Bloomberg. Notably, the surge came in the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey & Irma, depicting strong complacency in the stock market. Again, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved up 5,000 points this year — the biggest annual gain in its history — and is moving closer to another major milestone of 25,000.The world’s largest economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.3% in the July-September quarter (2nd estimate), marking the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014 and up from the second quarter's 3.1%. Again, further decline in unemployment (4.1% in November) will keep the momentum alive for the construction sector. The November figure came in the lowest since December 2000.All these positive factors have helped the construction sector to grow more than 24% this year, higher than the broader market’s (S&P 500) rally of 20.1%. We note that the construction sector has been a major contributor to the S&P 500’s growth story.Investing in the Construction sector might sound profitable right now, as it falls within the top 31% (5 out of 16 sectors) of the Zacks Industry Rank, which hints at further growth.5 Construction Stocks that Outpaced the MarketWe bring five construction stocks that not only outpaced the market (S&P 500) in 2017 but also are expected to outperform in the coming years.

1917,DHI,"The U.S. housing industry appears to be back on track after a few sluggish months, indicating gradual recovery on strong demand. Americans bought new homes in October at the fastest pace in a decade, reflecting the underlying strength of the economy.October Housing DataPer the latest report from the Commerce Department, new-home sales increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 685,000 in October. This marks the second straight monthly gain, scaling their highest level in 10 years. Northeast and Midwest witnessed maximum increase, while the South and West registered less gains.October sales figure increased 18.7% from a year ago and 6.2% from the prior month. It is to be noted that September’s sales pace was revised down to 645,000 units from the previously reported 667,000 units.The recent increase in new home sales in the U.S. homebuilding and sales of previously owned homes suggests that the market is regaining momentum after hurricanes Harvey and Irma temporarily stalled activity (read more: Existing Home Sales Rise in October: Will the Rally Last?).However, the industry has been challenged by shortage of homes for sale, suitable land and skilled labor. The inventory of new homes on the market was 282,000 units. It would take just 4.9 months to deplete the current supply of homes in the market. Limited land availability is driving prices higher, as average sales price of a new home jumped 13.6% year over year and 5% from the prior month to $400,200.Nonetheless, housing/homebuilding has been on a high in recent times on solid home sales data, affordable interest/mortgage rates and impressive housing starts figure. Resilient job growth along with seemingly high homebuilders’ confidence are adding to the momentum.New residential construction in the United States increased more than expected in October, reinstating strength in the housing industry. Per the latest jointly released report by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, constructions for new homes increased 13.7% in October 2017 to 1.29 million units (seasonally adjusted annual rate) from the prior month. This also marks the biggest surge in 12 months as housing starts witnessed big gains in single-family homes and apartments.Again, confidence among homebuilders increased in November to its highest reading in eight months to 70 and second-highest since the recession (July 2005), according to the Housing Market Index by the National Association of Home Builders (""NAHB"") and Wells Fargo.Keeping in mind the positive momentum, we zero in on some housing stocks that have gained in the current scenario and have the potential to rise further before mortgage rates start rising.Winning StocksWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we narrowed down the list four stocks in the Construction sector based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Texas-based D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI  -  Free Report) is one of the leading national homebuilders.
