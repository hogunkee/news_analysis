24,MCHP,"Semiconductor, software, fiber-optic telecom gear and other tech issues helped boost the Nasdaq composite to its highest levels of the session in afternoon trading Wednesday. Apple (AAPL), up 0.6% to 154.04, also helped push the Nasdaq and other key indexes higher.XApple, which has joined a pilot program that is meant to get health-related apps on a fast track for potential FDA approvals, remains a touch below a new breakout point at 156.75, 10 cents above the left-side high in a 10-week flat-base pattern, one of the most bullish chart patterns seen in leading growth stocks.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite back off session highs but was still up 1.2% as it gained further distance above its critical 50-day moving average. At 6472, the tech-rich index at one point looked poised to post an all-time closing high.Meanwhile, small-cap indexes were faring especially well as banking shares of virtually all stripes also rallied ahead of details from President Trump's tax cut proposal, expected later today during a speech in Indianapolis.Late on Tuesday, some of the tax cut plans were previewed among members of Congress and included a slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, a cut of the top individual income tax rate of 39.6%, a doubling of standard deductions for filing tax returns, and higher child tax credits.The S&P 500 rose 0.4% and notched a new all-time high before easing a bit. The large-cap benchmark is getting weighed down a bit by losses in utility, food, drugstore chain, gold mining and other defensive-oriented industry groups.The Dow Jones industrial average edged up nearly 0.3%, helped by gains of 1 point or more in at least seven of the 30 components in the index, including Goldman Sachs (GS) (still forming a saucer-type base), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) (trying to overcome upside resistance near 94) and McDonald's (MCD) (which triggered a sell signal with a sharp break of the 50-day moving average near 157).The small-cap S&P 600 surged 2.2%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 1.9%. Strength in the auto, airline, trucking and shipping sectors held up, as the Dow Jones transportation average rallied more than 0.6%.The Dow utilities are off 1.2% as the yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond soared to 2.30%, the highest in weeks.Volume is running higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Tuesday, a bullish sign for the market. All of the major indexes are also trading near all-time highs.Going back to Apple, if the megacap tech cannot quickly rebound back above its latest buy point of 156.75, expect the stock to take more time in forming a potential new base. Also, watch to see if its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which has fallen to a poor grade of E on a scale of A (superior accumulation) to E (heavy selling), can improve.Apple is seeing a slow-yet-steady pickup in the top line, a critical factor in its future stock potential. Revenue rose 3% in the fiscal fourth quarter ended in December 2016, ending a three-quarter slump, then grew 5% and 7% in the next two quarters.The Street sees Apple's revenue climbing at a faster rate again, up 9% to $50.93 billion in Q4 of this current fiscal year, then 11% in Q1 of fiscal 2018 to $86.71 billion.Within the semiconductor sector, Nvidia (NVDA) expanded its gains, rising more than 2% to 175.89 in above-average turnover. Shares of the expert in graphics processors and chips for artificial intelligence and self-driving vehicles backtracked after surpassing a new flat-base buy point at 174.66 a few weeks ago, but are now back above that proper entry.Sometimes a high-quality stock such as Nvidia, a member of the IBD 50, needs more than one attempt to break out successfully. And keep in mind that the big-cap tech play has already boomed more than 420% from a 33.16 cup-with-handle breakout back in March 2016, before the latest base formed.Another concern is how Wall Street will react to the inevitable slowdown in earnings and revenue growth in the next few quarters. From Q3 (ended in October) of fiscal 2017 to Q2 (ended in July) in the current fiscal year, Nvidia's EPS growth has been astonishing, rising 720%, 89%, 183%, 126% and 124% on an adjusted basis, according to William O'Neil + Co. data.When earnings grow that fast, it's very hard to keep up such a hot pace.Revenue at Nvidia, which also makes semiconductors for data centers, jumped 24%, 54%, 55%, 48% and 56% vs. year-ago levels over the same five-quarter span.Nvidia benefits from being in a strong chip sector, which through Tuesday's close ranked No. 2 among 33 sectors as seen in IBD's stock research tables. The 33 sectors are ranked every day in terms of a blend of mid- to long-term price performance.IBD's chip sector is up 26.8% since Jan. 1, slamming the 11.5% gain of the S&P 500.Other notable chip companies with excellent fundamentals and strong price action include Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT), ASML (ASML) (98 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup) of the Netherlands, wafer fabrication titan Applied Materials (AMAT) and fellow chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX).Applied Materials stretched its gain to more than 7% to 49.16, quickly getting back above a 47.69 early buy point within a cuplike base. Shares remain in buy range up to 50.07.Watch to see if Applied Materials' volume runs well above the 50-day average by day's end. With less than a half hour to go in the session, turnover is running nicely at a pace 76% above its 50-day average. Among big-cap names, it's preferable to see volume bulge at least 40% higher than normal at the breakout or soon after. Applied has 1.07 billion shares outstanding and a $51.9 billion market value.Applied's base is later stage; the rally got going with a breakout from a bottoming-base pattern at 21.77 in May 2016, and that base was first stage. Keep in mind, though, that a select number of companies with truly outstanding fundamentals, the best products and services, and top management are capable of staging nice gains from third-, fourth- and even fifth-stage bases.Applied is expected to grow fiscal 2017 earnings 83% to $3.20 a share, extending three years of increases. In fiscal 2018, which ends in October next year, EPS growth is seen slowing sharply, up 12% at $3.60 a share. However, analysts' estimates for a full year out are often conservative.Ultra Clean of Hayward, Calif., rallied more than 9% to 29.41 in fast turnover. Shares in the small-cap name are extended past a new cup buy point at 26.30. The proper buy zone extends up to 27.62. It's especially important to buy chip stocks within the right price zone, no more than 5% above a proper entry, because they tend to swing more quickly and more violently than the average company on Wall Street.Buying a stock that's too far extended in price can force a new investor to exit a stock with a sharp loss during a normal price pullback.Lithography systems expert ASML rose 2.9% to 167.61 in brisk trading, and has now rallied 21% following a July breakout past a 137.37 buy point in an eight-week flat base.In a good flat base, the correction from head to toe should not exceed 15%. In ASML's case, the stock dipped from 137.27 on May 16 to 126.03 on June 12, a mere 8.2%. Notice, too, how the megacap tech firm had a solid prior uptrend before sculpting the new base.IBD's TAKE: One of the keys to a breakout from a solid base, including the cup with handle, is to see a prior uptrend of 30% or more before a stock forms its next base. Read this Investor's Corner column to become more acquainted with using charts to get an edge on Wall Street and improve your market timing in both stocks and the major indexes.Microchip Technology (MCHP), currently in IBD's Big Cap 20 screen, rose 1.2% to 88.68 and is in buy range from an 86.04 handle entry in a shallow cup.The Chandler, Ariz., expert in flash memory and microcontrollers for multiple markets has shown steady profit growth since fiscal 2014 (ended in March that year).

Micron rose 4.6% to close at 56.50 on the stock market today.The memory chip market is healthy and fears of a down cycle are overblown, Daryanani said in a report to clients.The markets for DRAM and Nand chips are ""structurally different"" today than in past cycles, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor one thing, the number of competitors has shrunk. The number of DRAM manufacturers has gone from 15 to three in the last 20 years, making for a ""sensible pricing environment,"" he said. Only Micron, Samsung and SK Hynix now make DRAM chips.""While we don't think cycles are done, we do think they are inherently more muted and Micron is positioned to generate positive earnings per share and free cash flow under most down-cycle scenarios,"" Daryanani said.Separately, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in his note to clients Tuesday that Micron's analyst day next week could provide a positive catalyst for the stock. He rates Micron as buy with a price target of 70.On Monday, Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy raised his price target on Micron stock to 101 from 95 and reiterated his buy rating.DRAM prices are tracking ahead of estimates for the May-ending quarter, while Nand flash prices are in line with estimates, he said.Also, the ""Nand flash market is growing and far from collapsing as the bear case has it,"" Cassidy said in a note.Micron is one of two chip companies on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. The other is graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA).Elsewhere in the semiconductor sector, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland raised his rating on Advanced Micro Devices to neutral from negative.He changed his sentiment on the stock after AMD's better-than-expected first-quarter results. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for sales and earnings in the March quarter and guided much higher for sales in the current quarter.Rolland also cited Ethereum cryptocurrency-mining trends and strong demand for AMD's Ryzen and Epyc chips as reasons for the upgrade.

32,MCHP,"Stocks got pummeled on virtually all corners of the market on Monday, but it's not at all clear if the market is ripe again for a new market correction. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) cut its early losses bullishly and Boeing (BA), which triggered a key sell signal on Wednesday for recent new shareholders, edged higher for a second straight session.The Nasdaq composite dropped the hardest among the major indexes, falling nearly 2%. At one point, the tech-driven index was down as much as 2.6%.But even at the intraday low of 7285, the Nasdaq actually stayed above its important 50-day moving average. The leading index, currently up nearly 6% year to date, also stands 4% below its March 13 peak of 7637.The Dow Jones industrial average, hurt by eight of its 30 components falling 2 points or more, sank 1.3%. The S&P 500 lost 1.4%. Defensive issues paced the upside, including gold mining and food names.Solar stocks also bucked the decline, and IBD's Energy-Solar industry group ranks a solid 32nd among 197 industry groups for six-month relative performance. While Canadian Solar (CSIQ) helped lead the way, rising more than 6% to 16.59 in heavy turnover on big Q4 results (earnings up 321% to $1.01 a share, revenue up 66% to $1.11 billion), the true leader in the group is IBD 50 name SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG).Boeing undercut its 50-day moving average deeply on Wednesday in big volume, a clear-cut signal that some institutions eagerly took profits after the aerospace giant's big run. However, on Friday it did not usher a second sell signal despite falling 6.8% for the week.The reason? Boeing saw heavy turnover last week, but it didn't rise more than 40% above the 10-week moving average. The Dow Jones industrial component also saw a little bit of lift off its lows for the week.IBD research has found that when a true market leader takes out its 10-week moving average in a big way and weekly volume screams more than 40% above average, it's usually a very reliable indicator that a greater correction is underway. So for those who do not have a large profit cushion, taking at least partial profits is a savvy portfolio-management move.The Dow utility average fell 0.8%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is around 2.85% ahead of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting on interest rating that starts Tuesday.Megacap techs bore the brunt of the selling, as did large-cap and midcap names in the semiconductor, computer and telecom gear sectors. Alphabet (GOOGL) fell 3% to 1,100.07 in fast turnover and dove below its 50-day moving average for the second time in nearly three weeks.Alphabet still harbors a 9.3% gain since its October breakout from a constructive flat base with a 1,006.39 entry.Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), one of the four tech members of the Dow industrials, showed buying support at 50 as shares fell just 0.6% to 50.84 in quiet trade.Notice on an IBD chart or MarketSmith chart how Intel's relative strength line, painted in blue, has not given much ground after bolting higher in February.Plus, since Intel fell less than the S&P 500, expect to see a bump up in the RS line. This line compares a stock's day-to-day performance with the large-cap benchmark.Intel has recently staged solid profit growth, with earnings rising 21%, 4%, 22%, 22%, 26% and 37% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. The semiconductor giant, eager to become a force in self-driving cars and other new markets, has also posted modest to high single-digit revenue growth for nine quarters in a row.At this point, Intel shares are still well-extended in price after breaking out of a long saucer base at 36.80 back in mid-September. Watch for a potential new base to form or a fresh test of support at the 10-week moving average, visible only on a weekly chart.The stock earns an enviable 95 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 at IBD Stock Checkup, topped only by Microchip Tech (MCHP) and STMicroelectronics (STM). Both of these names sport a 96 Composite. Cypress Semiconductor (CY), also in the semiconductor manufacturing industry group, holds a 95 ranking.STMicroelectronics, one of the most exciting semiconductor firms based in Europe, dropped more than 1% on Monday, but volume shrank 45% below average. At 24.23, the stock lies just 4% below its 52-week peak of 25.30 and it's now formed a narrow cup with handle.Notice on a daily chart how the stock has eased lightly in price over the past five sessions. Volume was bone dry. That's ideal action in a short handle.The buy point in this first-stage base is 24.78, 10 cents above the handle's high.Earnings at the diversified maker of controllers, smartcards and power transistors powered 250% higher to 98 cents a share on a 20% jump in sales to $8.35 billion. The Street sees earnings rising 33% to $1.30 a share this year and up an additional 14% in 2019.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals and financial markets.)RELATED:The Big Picture: Nasdaq Slumps, But Here's The Good NewsThese 5 Top Stocks In Or Near Buy Range Stood Out In Sell-OffWhich Top Growth Stocks Sold Off Today?

37,MCHP,"The stock market closed mixed Monday after the Nasdaq composite led thanks to a muscular performance for semiconductor stocks.X The Nasdaq added 0.4% in notching another record high.

The S&P 500 fell 0.1% after moving between gains and losses for much of the session.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6%, although selling was concentrated on a few industrial components and Intel (INTC), which failed to participate in Monday's chip rally and lost more than 1%.Boeing (BA) slid 3%, accounting for a big chunk of the Dow's drop. The aerospace and defense giant continues to moderate after its big advance from a September breakout.

40,MCHP,"Chip stocks tanked Thursday as investors weighed a lowered outlook for the sector from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and other negative data points. At least one Wall Street analyst thinks investors overreacted.In a report Friday, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said the broad sell-off was not justified.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.3% on Thursday. It was the biggest one-day drop for the index, known as SOX, since Feb. 8 and only the tenth time in the past eight years where the index fell more than 4%.The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) fell 1.2% on the stock market today.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSeveral concerns led to the broad sell-off on Thursday, Gill said. They included Taiwan Semi's weak near-term guidance and reduced annual forecast for the semiconductor industry, plus renewed concerns about customers double ordering, he said.Investors also reacted to China's hesitance to approve Qualcomm's (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), citing competition concerns.Investors are worried that chip stocks have passed the top of the current up cycle and could be headed down, Gill said.Taiwan Semi blamed its lowered guidance on smartphone demand weakness, particularly at Apple (AAPL), and cryptocurrency mining volatility. Conversely the company noted strength in chips for automotive, Internet of Things and high-performance computing, Gill said.Investors would be wise to avoid chip companies in Apple's iPhone supply chain, but should stick with chip firms with exposure to automotive, industrial and data-center markets, Gill said.Apple chip suppliers include Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Tower Semiconductor (TSEM), he said.In the auto, industrial and data center markets, Gill likes Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Nvidia (NVDA), ON Semiconductor (ON) and Silicon Laboratories (SLAB).RELATED:Taiwan Semiconductor Warning Hits Chip Stocks And AppleQualcomm Stock Pressured By China Pushback On NXP DealASML Beats First-Quarter Views, But Gross Margin Outlook DisappointsLam Research Stock Slides On Soft Chip Gear Shipment Guidance

41,MCHP,"The stock market was spooked early Friday as steel and aluminum tariffs proposed by President Trump fueled more market uncertainty, but major stock indexes recovered nicely in afternoon trading, with tech stocks leading the way.X After falling 1.6% intraday, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.7%. Even when the blue-chip index was down hard early, hurt in part by weakness in names like McDonald's (MCD) and Boeing (BA), selling was muted in the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500.The Nasdaq turned higher, up 0.5%, as it tries to reclaim the 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 was down a fraction. The benchmark index is still firmly below the 50-day moving average.McDonald's slumped 5% after RBC Capital lowered its price target to 170 from 190 due to lukewarm reception so far for the company's new $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu launched in January.Boeing, meanwhile, was one of several industrial names in the Dow pressured because higher tariffs usually result in higher input costs. Shares gave back nearly 2%.To be sure, Friday's performance was good to see in light of three straight distribution days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, although overall market health is still in question due to signs of institutional selling in the indexes.In the stock market today, Microchip (MCHP) jumped more than 2% on news it's buying Microsemi (MSCC) in a deal valued at more than $10 billion. The deal will give Microchip a stronger presence in the aerospace and defense market. Shares of Microsemi gained nearly 5%.Elsewhere, Micron Technology (MU) looked poised for its third straight weekly gain. Shares rose 2.5% to 48.83. Micron is in buy range from a double-bottom entry at 47.08.In earnings news, Splunk (SPLK) soared 8% to 100.98 on strong results, but it was quite extended from an 84.98 buy point ahead of the results.IBD's TAKE: A 7% rise in heavy volume for Splunk is a sign of institutional buying, one of the main driver's of a stock's price. To see other stocks under accumulation on a daily basis, check Stocks On The Move  on the home page of Investors.com.A nice earnings report also fueled a 6% rise for Gap (GPS).

42,MCHP,"The stock market rally isn't quite dead. The S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 sold off Friday, but all held above their recent lows. But the chip sector, along with key semiconductor stocks Nvidia (NVDA), Applied Materials (AMAT), Texas Instruments (TXN), undercut recent levels Friday, while Micron Technology (MU) wiped out big gains and flashed sell signals.The chip action is worrisome for the stock market rally attempt. It's hard for stocks to have a sustained advance without chips taking part. For one, chips are a big part of the overall market, especially the tech sector. Second, if chip stocks are struggling, that could be a bad sign for demand in the vast array of products that use chips, from the Apple (AAPL) iPhone to a Tesla (TSLA) Model 3.The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbled 3.1% on Friday, undercutting its April 2 low. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) ETF also did so. Notably, the Philly Sox index retreated on Thursday. The major averages rose somewhat that day, but volume was light and the Nasdaq lagged.Nvidia retreated 7.5% last week to a two-month low. But its real problems began March 27, when Nvidia said that it was halting self-driving tests. That also was bad news for Nvidia customer Tesla. That was a bad day for the general market, with the Nasdaq finding resistance at the 50-day line and reversing sharply lower.But there were warning signs earlier that day. Soon after the March 27 open, Applied Materials and fellow chip-gear maker Lam Research (LRCX) reclaimed buy points, but quickly backed off.Last week Applied Materials skidded 5.9% last week to its worst levels since mid-February, approaching its 200-day line. Texas Instruments' relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is at a two-month low. Several other chip stocks undercut recent lows, including Lam Research, Apple chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMicron Technology was a rare chip stock that was a market leader in recent weeks. Micron had a powerful breakout from late February and rapidly ran up. But the memory-chip giant has sold off 23% from its March 13. On Friday, shares nearly completed a round trip back to the 47.08 double-bottom base buy point. Micron closed below its 50-day line.Micron's sell-off dragged down several other memory plays, including chip-gear makers Applied Materials and Lam.However, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF, Nvidia and Micron were all up about 1% in premarket trading Monday.Another factors also aren't encouraging. The three-day stock market rally came on increasingly light volume, while Friday's sell-off came on heavier trade. That's classic stock market correction behavior.Some recent breakouts, such as Five Below (FIVE), Vipor Energy Partners (VNOM), fell back below buy points on Friday. Apple and Netflix (NFLX), which reclaimed their 50-day moving averages by Thursday, fell back below those levels on Friday.Despite Friday's big retreat, the put/call ratio came in at a relatively tame 1.04. That fear gauge is below the 1.15 level that often indicates a short-term bottom. The market has several big sell-offs over the past 10 weeks, only to bounce back quickly, sometimes that very day. So even a stock market correction, investors may be complacent.Instead, that lack of investor panic should be one more reason to worry. If nothing else, the recent market swings should underscore the importance of not trying to jump back into stocks before a confirmed rally.As long as the major averages hold above recent lows, the stock market rally attempt is still live.

Stock market futures were positive Tuesday and at least mixed on Wednesday before the open.Twenty-one stocks with Composite Ratings of 95 or above that trade at least $8 million in shares fell below their 50-days on Wednesday. That includes chip plays ASML Holding (ASML), Lam Research (LRCX) and NXP Semiconductor (NXPI). All-star winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their runs.These 21 stocks reflect the ongoing shift from top-rated, mostly tech names as a new stock market correction has taken hold. Splunk (SPLK), Workday (WDAY) and 58.com (WUBA) are among the top stocks dropping below their 50-day.That action also reflects why the S&P 500 and especially the Nasdaq were under more pressure Wednesday, while the more ""old economy"" Dow Jones just edged lower.The list in some ways downplays the damage that growth stocks have suffered. These 21 stocks don't include Amazon, which has a Composite Rating of 87. They don't include Square (SQ). Square round-tripped an early March breakout on Wednesday, but closed just above its 50-day. And they don't include Nvidia (NVDA). Nvidia was a catalyst to Tuesday's stock market sell-off that triggered the correction call. Nvidia crashed through its 50-day on Tuesday, tumbling nearly 8%. The chipmaker slid 1.85% on Wednesday.Let's take a look at ASML Holding, Lam Research and NXP Semiconductor. In addition to these names, Microchip Technology (MCHP), MKS Instruments (MKSI) and Analog Devices (ADI) also are among the 21 stocks. Chip plays led the stock market upswing but have been notable losers over the past several sessions.Chip-gear makers ASML Holding and Lam Research fell 3% on the stock market today, falling enough to invalidate recent buy points. Early Tuesday, Lam Research briefly retook a double-bottom buy point at the open, but soon reversed. ASML came within a whisker of moving back into a buy zone Tuesday before its own reversal. Those reversals, along with similar action from some other chip-gear names, were a bearish sign for leading stocks Tuesday before Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled and Facebook (FB) renewed its ongoing crash.NXP Semiconductor plunged 4.3% to 116.26, crashing through its 50-day line and approaching its 200-day for the first time since Qualcomm (QCOM) agreed to buy the automotive- and wireless-chip maker in late September. Qualcomm reportedly is having trouble getting China's approval for the NXP deal. Last month Qualcomm raised its takeover price to $127.50 a share from $110 to satisfy key NXP investors.Other stocks on the list include Green Dot (GDOT), TD Ameritrade (AMTD), Canada Goose (GOOS), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Ilumina (ILMN).YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Techs Drive Stocks Into Bear Territory?In Market Correction, Look For Stocks Like Lululemon With These 3 TraitsThese 5 Tech Standouts Are Making A Round Trip From Breakouts

Stocks dipped Friday on a report that Michael Flynn, briefly President Trump's national security adviser, is willing to testify against Trump as part of a plea deal.Tech leaders, including many chip stocks and China internets, struggled. Bitcoin frenzy continued amid growing acceptance and concerns. General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019.X The Dow and S&P 500 rallied to record highs as tax-cut hopes lifted stocks generally, with the Flynn-Trump news only paring gains.

Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong.

135,MCHP,"Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 78 to 82 Wednesday. X IBD's proprietary rating tracks share price movement with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The rating shows how a stock's price movement over the last 52 weeks compares to all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the best stocks tend to have an RS Rating of over 80 as they begin their biggest climbs.Taiwan Semiconductor broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 37.02 entry from a flat base. In the scenario where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to take shape. Also keep in mind that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. Taiwan Semiconductor showed -2% EPS growth last quarter, while sales growth came in at 2%. The company holds the No. 6 rank among its peers in the Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. Microchip Technology (MCHP), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Analog Devices (ADI) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Chip Stocks And Semiconductor Industry NewsWhich Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?Why Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

138,MCHP,"The stock market's ascent has slowed since June. But Wells Fargo Growth Fund's Tom Ognar sees a buying opportunity for the kinds of growth stocks his fund holds, which include PayPal (PYPL), Alibaba (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Netflix (NFLX).X""The market has been a little more defensive, and it seems some higher multiple stocks have corrected a little — but nothing too discouraging,"" said Ognar, who is lead manager of $4.4 billion Growth Fund (SGRAX). ""To us, it opens opportunities. It has made many secular growth stocks more attractively valued.""Those are the kinds of stocks that Ognar and co-managers Bruce Olson and Joseph Eberhardy aim for and that have fueled the fund's long-term outperformance. ""The Growth Fund has always had a bias (in favor of) investing in longer-term secular growth companies that exhibit robust and sustainable growth,"" Ognar said. Many are built for vigorous growth in a variety of economic conditions.That focus has driven the fund in the long term. Ognar has been a manager of this portfolio since May 2002. Going into Thursday, over the past 15 years the fund's 11.53% average annual gain outpaced 93% of its peer group tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the big-cap bogey's 9.01% average yearly gain.This year the fund has tacked on an additional 22.16%, topping 80% of its direct rivals, despite a rocky past three months during which the fund beat only 43% of its peers.Olson has been a co-manager since the start of 2005. Eberhardy has been a manager since late April 2008.The recent downturn is certainly not the only time that the managers have added to names they like. They added to positions in recent quarters in several favorites, including PayPal, Alibaba, Nvidia and Netflix.PayPal benefits from the shift to electronic payments for transactions. That trend is driven by the need to make electronic payments for online transactions. It's also driven by global governments' desire to track transactions so they can assess taxes. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals.PayPal isn't the only holding that benefits from that trend. ""Square (SQ), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Global Payments (GPN) all benefit from the transition away from cash,"" Ognar said. ""The other big push for that (group) is the movement from offline, brick-and-mortar retailers to online retailers.""In addition, a change in PayPal's business strategy has cut a source of risk. ""PayPal has evolved its business model,"" Ognar said. ""It no longer fights with peers. It has made them more partners. It has signed partnerships with Visa and Mastercard, where it no longer creates barriers (for consumers) using Visa and Mastercard. Now it makes it easier for consumers to make payments through Visa and Mastercard using the PayPal platform.""Alibaba, China's leading online retail marketplace, benefits from the growth of online retail, the same trend that helps Amazon, Ognar notes, and it is diversifying geographically. ""We've felt there was an opportunity there since the (Alibaba) IPO,"" Ognar said.Both stocks are on Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks.A third trend that the fund plays is ""the digitization of the economy and consumer,"" Ognar said. He added, ""It's a compelling growth opportunity for semiconductor firms,"" Ognar said. Chipmaker Nvidia, which is another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, driverless and driver-assisted cars, and cryptocurrencies, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Portfolio newcomer Netflix is too small of a holding to be the poster child for any broad investment theme for the fund, Ognar says. Still, the stock popped 3.5% on Wednesday. IBD readers saw that the video-streaming service bounced off its 50-day moving average, rising toward a buy point.Among other holdings, Microchip Technology (MCHP) is another chipmaker that benefits from digitization of the economy and consumer. ""Electronics and digitization are influencing more of what we do and the products we use to do those things,"" Ognar said.Microchip Tech's products include signal microcontrollers. ""They're like little full-blown computers within thermostats in your home, the entertainment system of your car, or camera, or brake system of your car,"" he said.While the fund has trimmed its Microchip stake, the stock is still the fund's largest chipmaker. Shares are up 34% so far this year.The fund has trimmed stocks that have been big share-price gainers this year, including software titan Microsoft (MSFT) and video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI), to reduce their weightings. ""It's more of a risk-management move as they've grown in position size, not because of a degradation in growth opportunities,"" Ognar said. RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

139,MCHP,"Talk about hot! Brian Demain is lead manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise (JANEX), which is an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. So is the fund's twin, $1 billion Aspen Enterprise (JAAGX), of which he also is skipper.XThe portfolios won Best Funds honors by outperforming the S&P 500 in four time periods ended Dec. 31 — the trailing one, three, five and 10 years.And they did so in not just one category but in three — diversified equity mutual funds, growth mutual funds and midcap mutual funds.That put them into a small group of gems. A mere 44 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, out of 1,104 with assets of at least $100 million, prevailed as winners across those four time spans.Demain and Cody Wheaton run the funds with little turnover, just 20% now, according to Morningstar Inc. Among both portfolios' holdings are Crown Castle (CCI), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Global Payments (GPN), Sensata Technologies (ST) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD). All are either forming basing patterns or in buy ranges.Enterprise is open to investors who already own shares. It's also open to old or new shareholders in 401(k) plans that already offer the fund, as well as to old or new investor clients of a wirehouse brokerage that offers the identical strategy through a separately managed account. Twin sister Aspen Enterprise can be bought by old or new investors through some insurance companies.A midcap fund at Janus Henderson that is still open to new investors is $4 billion Mid Cap Value (JMIVX).Demain, who is 40 years old, talked about his investment approach and several key stock holdings in a recent interview with IBD:IBD: Brian, summarize your investment approach.Demain: First, we look for what we call sustainable growth. We want companies that are growth companies today and will be three, five, seven years from now. They may not be the fastest growers, but they can grow for the long term.Second, we're looking for companies with sustainably high returns on invested capital. It's great if a company can grow. But if it's not earning high returns on invested capital, it's not increasing shareholder value. So we try to understand a company's competitive advantage, because that's what will drive its long-term return on invested capital.Third, we care about the quality of a company's management team. We like management teams that focus on the right areas, and that are good leaders.If we find companies that meet those three criteria and we can buy them at attractive valuations and hold them for the long term, we can outperform our peers.IBD: The fund's performance is consistent, as shown by its being an IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winner. Is the key its outperformance during up markets or during down markets?Demain: We've generally been able to keep up in up markets and outperform in down markets. We try to have a predicted beta (a measurement of volatility relative to the market or benchmark) against our Russell MidCap Growth Index benchmark of between 0.85 and 1, so we have less absolute risk than the benchmark. But it's higher than 0.85, because we don't want to only outperform in a down market. That's where we want to shine, but we do OK in up markets as well.IBD: Why do you like midcaps?Demain: They're not as mature as large caps, so they have real growth opportunities ahead of them. But their business models are more established than small caps'.Many have withstood competitive challenges, which small caps may not have. But they tend to be less volatile than small caps.IBD: You've got about 70% of your assets in the technology, industrials and health care sectors. Why do you expect to find so many opportunities in those spaces?Demain: With tech and health care, it is the power of innovation. In tech, we've been overweight in hardware and semiconductors. The mobile internet is driving semiconductor growth. And we're seeing a lot of innovation in software pushing itself into our lives.In health, we own biotechs, pharmaceuticals, life-science tools and diagnostic companies. Aging baby boomers and an emerging middle class globally are driving innovations in drug development and diagnostics.IBD: You've noted that corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation may not occur as fast as many investors have hoped. How have you hedged your bets on those areas?Demain: Take tax cuts. Sensata is a Netherlands domiciled company (which makes sensors for aircraft, cars and other products) but it does business in the U.S. It pays a low tax rate because of where it is domiciled, so it will not benefit from lower U.S. rates.We also own TD Ameritrade (which is a brokerage). It pays a full tax rate, so if there's reform it will benefit. But policy changes can cut both ways. Ameritrade also benefits from rising interest rates. It sweeps clients' cash balances into TD Bank and earns more money on that spread as rates rise. And we own Crown Castle (a REIT that owns wireless cell towers). It has high levels of borrowing, so it will be hurt by high interest rates.IBD: Lam Research (LRCX) must be one of your semiconductor plays. Describe it, please.Demain: They are a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. In the last few years, we've gone from everything being etched on one plane of each microchip to effectively stacked layers on chips. So a lot of growth has gone to etching deposition players like Lam.In addition, demand in the memory market is robust. That's driven by uptake in solid-state drives. We're going from the old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. That demands lots of chips, which is good for Lam.And we like their valuation. The stock trades at 13.5 times forward earnings. If you back out their cash, it is close to 12 times. The market's multiple is north of 18 times. And several high quality semiconductor companies are trading at 20 times.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is best known for Revlimid, its blood-cancer treatment. Do you like its other products?Demain: You're right, Revlimid is its workhorse and continues to grow due to longer treatment duration and finding new patients. But what do they do after Revlimid goes off-patent in 2026?The outlook for three other Celgene products — Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane — is constructive. And we're excited about its pipeline of new (treatments). Also, they've done business development deals with cash from Revlimid to build emerging franchises in gastroenterology and immunology, and inflammation and immunology. Those things should make the 2026 patent cliff for Revlimid a manageable event.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is ranked a very strong No. 4 among 197 groups. Celgene earns its top-dog status thanks to such traits as a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an annual pretax margin of 50.4, which is the highest it's been in at least nine years. Compare its other technical and fundamental strengths to its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.IBD: Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth has accelerated for six quarters in a row. Does your thesis revolve around the fact that their chips are used in a variety of products?Demain: The majority of their revenue is from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that can go into all sorts of devices from airplanes to microwave ovens to kids' toys. That has great growth dynamics, which is a function of the growth of the Internet of Things. That's the company's sustainable growth.That business has a very fragmented customer base. You're not just selling a ton of chips to one customer like Apple (AAPL). You're selling to thousands of end markets. That's their competitive advantage.As for a good management team, the company is led by Steve Sanghi. We have high regard for his value creation. The company recently acquired Atmel, which was a large microcontroller competitor. It had good assets, but was poorly managed. Sanghi has improved operating margins and driven strong earnings growth. And valuation is not that demanding at about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: How does SS&C Technologies (SSNC) illustrate your investment approach?Demain: This is another example of sustainable growth plus competitive advantage plus strong management. SS&C provides back-office services for financial companies. As asset management matures, more companies want to focus on their core competencies. Rather than run back offices in-house, they look to outsource. And once they are embedded with a customer, other departments at the customer may outsource to them as well.SS&C is run by Bill Stone, who has a proven record of value creation. And their valuation is reasonable.IBD: Global Payments' earnings per share growth has sped up. Why?Demain: Think of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as electronic payment highways. Global Payments is the on- and offramp. They have relationships with merchants who accept credit card terminals. If you run a restaurant, for example, Global gives you software that not only accepts credit cards but also helps you run your restaurant. And Global has benefited from consolidation.IBD: What makes Heico (HEIA), which designs and repairs parts for aircraft and engines, attractive to you?Demain: Only certain approved suppliers can sell parts to airlines. Planes are in service for 25, 30 years, and need servicing. But only a relatively small number of companies have parts-manufacturing approval (PMA) from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European (regulatory) body. The FAA has (limited resources) and can only approve so many parts per year. Heico has the best position in the PMA market. They earn healthy margins.Also, the Mendelson family owns a large percentage of the company. It's most of their liquid net worth, so they care a lot about creating shareholder value, so we like to partner with them.IBD: What's driven the share-price uptrend by contact-lens developer Cooper (COO)?Demain: We like their sustainable growth. Contact lens are a growing category as contacts get more comfortable. They also benefit from international growth.There are only four players: Bausch & Lomb, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alcon and Cooper. Once a consumer picks one, they usually stick with it and won't change because of a small price difference.IBD: Why is index operator MSCI attractive?Demain: The way to think about them is that they benefit from the growth of ETFs. An active manager like Janus Henderson pays a fixed fee for access to a benchmark operator. For MSCI, when a fee dollar moves from an active to a passive fund, that dollar becomes more profitable.And once you are a standard index, it is hard (for users) to change.IBD: By the way, any plans to reopen Enterprise Fund to all investors?Demain: No, we are managing $18 billion (including money in Aspen Enterprise and in separately managed accounts using Enterprise's strategy). It makes us one of the larger midcap strategies. Our first priority is working on behalf of existing clients. They think being closed is in their best interests and that's why we've done this.RELATED:Winning Mutual Fund Focuses On Leading Stocks Like Autohome, MarketAxess7 Steps For Millennials Who Want To Become Rich Retirees

141,MCHP,"While top chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL) have pulled back from recent highs, high-voltage analog integrated circuits maker Power Integrations (POWI) is trying to sustain its recent breakout.After soaring past a 72.75 entry earlier this week in heavy volume, Power Integrations saw its IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating rise from 94 to 96 Thursday.The new rating is a sign the stock is outpacing 96% of all stocks when it comes to the most important stock-picking criteria. The best stocks tend to have a 95 or better grade as they kick off a significant move.Power Integrations is trading about 2% above a 72.75 entry from a consolidation. A stock is considered extended once it climbs more than 5% past the original entry price.Power Integrations has an 83 EPS Rating, meaning its recent quarterly and annual earnings growth is outpacing 83% of all stocks.Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A- shows heavy buying by institutional investors, such as mutual funds and pension funds, over the last 13 weeks.In Q1, the company reported 15% earnings growth. Sales growth rose 19%, up from 17% in the prior quarter. That marks one quarter of accelerating revenue growth.Power Integrations holds the No. 5 rank among its peers in the Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group.

145,MCHP,"The $1.6 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) has picked up steam. Its 13.44% gain this year going into Thursday tops 75% of its large-cap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's better than its 8.53% annual pace over the past three years, which beats 56% of its peers.The fund has received some of its drive from holdings like Applied Materials (AMAT), a semiconductor equipment and software maker that is up 75% year to date and has IBD's top Composite Rating of 99; and smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), which is up 34% this year and has a good 85 Comp Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Chemicals maker FMC, which is up 46% year to date, is another holding helping to drive Growth & Income. FMC's third-quarter earnings per share growth of 60% beat analysts' estimates. As IBD recently reported, it guided for full-year EPS of $2.76 to $2.86 a share, above consensus forecasts for $2.75.One reason for the fund's stronger showing this year is the spark it received from a rally in energy names like Cimarex Energy (XEC) and EOG Resources (EOG).Another reason is that its financial services stocks got a good bump up from the November election, in part on the expectation that the Republican victories would lead to a lighter regulatory burden on banks, says Michael Nayfa, assistant manager of the 40% fund sleeve run by a team from subadvisor Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss. At the same time, interest rates have been rising in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's rate hike this month. Higher rates have improved banks' net interest margins and profit outlook.For example, SLM (SLM), the private education-loan originator better known as Sallie Mae, is up 70% this year. It gapped up 18% the day after the election, and is up 56% overall since the election. The stock has a sterling 91 Comp Rating.Money center bank Morgan Stanley (MS), with a 96 Comp Rating, is up 36% this year and 27% since the election.The fund's management approach, with two separate sleeves of securities run independently of each other, is a two-heads-are-better-than-one strategy. Basically, it doubles the number of best ideas the fund can have.USAA's John Jares and John Toohey, who run a 60% sleeve, have been making changes since taking the helm of their segment of the fund from a subadvisor on Nov. 20, 2012. Since then, they have employed a more concentrated approach with their sleeve, trimming it to 60-80 names from its prior range of about 130-150, Jares says. And their top 10 holdings now tend to account for 30% to 50% of their sleeve. That's up from 20% or less.The idea is to boost the contribution to fund performance from their best ideas. ""Too much diversification is negative,"" Jares said.Jares and Toohey began their current stake in Applied Materials in Q1 2013, while the semiconductor industry was still under pressure from the financial crisis. Applied had completed a combination with Varian Semiconductor in 2011. After that, Applied began to cut costs, Jares says. ""They also increased R&D and began to get more products through their pipeline,"" Jares said. ""Now they have gained market share since the combination with Varian.""The Barrow Hanley sleeve focuses more on value-oriented stocks than the Jares-Toohey sleeve. That means hefty weights in financials and health care. But the Barrow Hanley sleeve also holds what assistant manager Michael Nayfa calls value technology names. ""Those are stocks that pay high dividend yield, have high free cash flow and that trade at reasonable valuations,"" Nayfa said.Microchip Technology (MCHP), for instance, has a dividend yield of 2.2%. Its shares are up 40% this year and within 2% of its all-time high.""It's a semiconductor company that is predominantly in microprocessors,"" Nayfa said. ""It's gaining market share across the auto and industrial spaces.""Microchip acquired Atmel early this year. ""We like the deal,"" Nayfa said. ""It's a good fit. Atmel gives them a foothold in 32-bit processors, which some (investors) argue they are behind in. This deal can be 20% to 25% accretive to their earnings. Microchip has a proven record of buying and integrating assets. They do a good job at cost synergies. It can be hard to reduce costs without losing business, but they do it.""RELATED:Check Out This Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio

148,MCHP,"Income from mutual funds? That's the holy grail of investors who yearn for a way to generate income that's as simple — and safe — as pocketing 5% interest from savings accounts in the good ol' days. But how can you do it? Many bond yields remain low. And rising rates have chipped away at bond prices. Investors fear similar damage in the REIT, telecom and utility spaces.What's an income investor to do? Mainly, don't rely on any one strategy. Use a variety of sources to cut your volatility, minimize price pullbacks and maximize your income.If instead you stick to a single, narrow strategy, expect volatility and uncertainty.Take a look at dividend funds that are not REIT, telecom or utility sector funds. Only two of the 11 that are in the top 10% in total returns over the three years ended Nov. 30 were also in the top 10% over the past 10 years. Another seven of those 11 funds don't even have a 10-year record.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingWhy diversify instead of relying on just one strategy? No one source of income looks sufficient, says Radu Gabudean, a manager of several American Century target date and target risk funds as well as $52.6 million Multi-Asset Income (AMJAX) and $16.4 million Global Allocation (AGAVX). Why not ""hire"" a professional fund manager, who can tap into a variety of sources for income for you, allocating from one to another as their fortunes rise and fall?""We have exposure to REITs, other dividend stocks in both the U.S. and internationally, high-yield bonds, convertibles, emerging markets debt,"" Gabudean said, referring to Multi-Asset Income.So, if you take that route, how do you decide which income-producing fund — or two or three — is right for you?An income-oriented stock fund will likely be more volatile than a bond fund over the long run. Yet many stock funds can generate better income in the foreseeable future. Those yields can be much higher, but only if you're willing to take a chance on a fund that tilts toward stocks that are troubled, at least in the near term.As for bonds, sure, yields are creeping up and the Federal Reserve is expected to resume its rate hikes. But rising rates translate into bond price declines.Look at four categories: dividend funds as well as utility, REIT and telecom sector funds. REITs, or real estate funds, offered the best 12-month yield, averaging 2.30% as of Nov. 30. That topped the other four groups' averages. But REIT funds' year-to-date total return of 1.10% was the worst of the four. Dividend funds' 11.69% total return was the best year-to-date average return. But its 1.64% yield was the worst.In contrast, qualified dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum of 20%. Under a Trump administration, tax rates may decline. But there still may be a tax advantage to income in the form of dividends and capital gains. Still, this year and possibly in years to come, you may want to create income by selling stock fund shares that have risen in value rather than by relying on dividends or interest. And the best price gains may come from stock funds that don't make income-generation a priority at all.How do some mutual funds navigate around these choices? Look at holdings in $2.3 billion Invesco Dividend Income Fund (FSTUX). Over the past three years, the fund's 11.26% average annual return ranks tops among all dividend stock mutual funds.The fund's 1.75% 12-month yield is slightly better than average.The fund's top-performing stock this year through Dec. 7 was Kennemetal (KMT), which makes tooling, engineered components and advanced materials. Shares are up 77% for the year. And the stock's 2.3% dividend yield was slightly better than the broad market's 2.01%, measured by SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).Not bad? Not so fast. Earnings per share growth has declined in six of the seven most recent quarters. The stock has a weak 54 Composite Rating from IBD. Still, this stock has mounted a powerful rally, even providing a nice gain after breaking out of a base last month.The portfolio holds sturdier looking names. A Composite Rating of 98 and an SMR Rating of A for Microchip Technology (MCHP) are signs of greater strength. Its stock is up 39% for this year. And EPS growth has accelerated, rising by 0% to 3%, 22% and 42% the past four quarters.IBD's TAKE: SMR is a proprietary rating pioneered by IBD to help investors identify companies with superior Sales Growth, Profit Margins, and Return on Equity ratios.

167,MCHP,"The Nasdaq tumbled 1.4% Thursday afternoon as semiconductors and other technology stocks were pounded.Volume was tracking higher across the board. Losers led winners by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq and NYSE.The chip equipment, chip design and chip manufacturing industry groups were down 3% to 3.5%, foundering in today's industry performance table. Software, fiber optic and other technology groups were in the bottom depths, too.Among sell-offs in chips, Microchip (MCHP) skidded 6% to its 50-day moving average. Nvidia (NVDA) slid 5%. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) sank 9%. A breakout attempt Nov. 21 fizzled and the stock has undercut its base.Intel (INTC) shed nearly 2% and continues working on a base. Qualcomm (QCOM) broke below its 50-day moving average in busy trading. But Semtech (SMTC) roared 9% to a three-year high after the chipmaker beat profit expectations.Other major Nasdaq components were lower too, including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). The stock fell 1.5% as it tested support at the 50-day line.The S&P 500 was off 0.4%.

168,MCHP,"Are there any mutual funds that hold Dow Jones Industrial stocks like Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) and also beat the broad stock market in both total return and yield?For many investors — especially people interested in retirement income — finding a mutual fund whose total return and yield top the stock market is the holy grail of investing.You can find such stock mutual funds. One place to look is among top-performing dividend-oriented stock funds. Several hold leading stocks that are approaching buy points or are within buy ranges.But be wary of dividend stock mutual funds that have only outperformed over relatively short recent periods.For example, the broad market measured by the S&P 500 scored a total return — share-price gain plus income — of 11.56% this year through July 24. The $93.1 billion American Capital World Growth & Income Fund (CWGIX), just to name one, did much better, galloping ahead 16.26%, according to Morningstar Inc. It holds Boeing along with many other stocks with attractive yield.But how risky would it be to bet on that fund going forward? World Growth & Income's longer-term performance is not as impressive as its year-to-date performance. Its five-year and 10-year average annual gains of 12.35% and 4.62% both lag the S&P 500's 15.47% and 7.33%.So, rather than looking for a fund that outperformed over a short recent period, look for long-term, consistent outperformers.Check out dividend-oriented stock mutual funds that have existed for at least 10 years. And consider confining your search to funds that have at least $100 million in shareholder assets. Those funds have survived long enough and satisfied enough shareholders to show that they are not unproven flash-in-the-pan portfolios.There are 544 such funds. And 61 of them average an annual total return higher than the S&P 500's in the past 10 years.That group's average 12-month yield is 1.59%. That lags the bogey's 1.91%, measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).Still, some individual stock mutual funds among those 61 outperformers do have 12-month yield that tops the S&P 500's.The three with the best 10-year average annual returns, whose yields also top the S&P 500's, are $1.1 billion Pimco StocksPlus Small (PSCSX), up an average of 12.07% a year; $1.4 billion Hennessy Gas Utility (GASFX), up 9.09% on average; and $13.9 billion AIG Focused Dividend Strategy (FDSAX), with a 9.07% average yearly gain. Their yields range from 2.36% by Hennessy to 4.33% for Pimco.The AIG fund, whose yield is 2.93%, holds stocks such as Boeing (BA), which is up 53% this year through Aug. 2. The aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor sports a 93 Composite Rating from IBD. Composite Ratings range from 1-99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.And Boeing is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.In addition, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.4%. It has boosted dividends five years in a row, according to dividend.com.AIG Focused Dividend also owns McDonald's, which is up 30% this year and yielding 2.4% and Caterpillar, up 24% and yielding 2.8%.Caterpiller is looking for a rebound in earnings, with analysts expecting growth of 51% and 24% this year and next following an average decline of 21% the past three years.The $522 million Nicholas Equity Income (NSEIX) is yet another one of the 61 funds whose 10-year average annual return and its current 12-month yield are better than the S&P 500's. The fund's yearly return over the decade is 8.54%. Its 12-month yield is 3.32%.One of the stocks helping Equity Income is PNC Financial Services (PNC). The bank holding company stock has a 2.3% dividend yield. Up 11% this year, shares are trading around 130 and are approaching a 131.93 entry point.Microchip Technology (MCHP) is another holding. Brian Demain, manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise Fund (JANEX) — which also holds Microchip Technology but is not a dividend-focused fund — recently told IBD that the company gets most of its revenue from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that are used in a wide variety of products. That diversification gives the company sustainable growth.Evidence of that is the company's earnings per share growth, which has accelerated for six quarters in a row.The stock has a dividend yield of 1.8%. Shares are up 24% this year. The stock, which has a 98 Comp Rating and an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD, is up 24% this year. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return on equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Trading around 80, the stock is below an 87.59 entry.The $32.2 billion Vanguard Dividend Growth (VDIGX) has gained at a yearly average of 8.07% over the past decade. Its current 12-month yield is 2%.Microsoft (MSFT) is one holding. The software giant, which has a 95 Comp Rating, is up 16% this year. Its dividend yield is 2.2%. After pulling back for the past week, the stock is slightly below its 72.99 buy point in a flat base.  RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHot Stocks Owned By Top-Performing Stock Mutual Funds

The maker of high-speed optical devices for communications networks sees adjusted EPS of 85-92 cents vs. views of 78 cents. But revenue of $138.5 million at the midpoint of its guidance is just above the consensus for $137.2 million. Acacia fell 1% Friday but rose 12.8% for the week.Fabrinet (FN) late Monday said fiscal Q1 EPS leapt 78% to 80 cents while revenue was up 53% to $332 million, its fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Both easily beat analyst estimates. Fabrinet also gave upbeat EPS and sales guidance for the current Q2. Fabrinet shares rose 8.9% for the week.Oil prices initially rose but closed down 1.5% to $43.41 a barrel — the third straight weekly slide — amid concerns about rising supply and weak demand.

Check out IBD's IPO Leaders stock list for a proprietary screen of recent IPOs with strong fundamental and technical traits.""After hosting PI's management team for investor meetings last week, we came away incrementally more confident in its competitive moat, near-term inventory levels and the likely critical need for its software,"" Erickson said in his research report.Impinj is a player in the Internet of Things (IoT). It sells systems that use RAIN RFID to track items for retail, pharmaceutical, health care, food and beverage, manufacturing and other industries. RAIN RFID is a wireless technology standard for connecting items to the internet, enabling businesses to identify, locate and check the status of each item. RAIN is an acronym derived from radio frequency identification.The biggest concerns related to Impinj are commoditization and product differentiation, Erickson said.""We came away more confident that attributes like read range, patented chip design and antenna tuning have led to its 65% market share,"" he said.Larger companies such as Texas Instruments (TXN) and Microchip (MCHP)-owned Atmel have tried their hand at UHF RFID and failed, so Impinj's technology likely solves more challenging problems than many investors realize, he said.RELATED:Impinj Soars To New High As First Earnings Since IPO Connects

Goldman Sachs (GS) outperformed in the Dow Jones industrial average.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 touched fresh highs midday but pared gains and were up 0.25% and 0.1%, respectively, by early afternoon.

223,MCHP,"Analog Devices' (ADI) $14.8 billion acquisition of longtime rival Linear Technology (LLTC) will cut its Apple (AAPL) exposure to 5%, Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach said Wednesday.The deal also could spur more consolidation in the semiconductor industry, says Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer. Last year, chip sector M&A hit a fever pitch as deals topped $100 billion, including Intel's $16.7 billion Altera buy and Broadcom's $37 billion merger with Avago Technologies.""With structurally slowing supply, rising barriers to entry, consolidation and a mix shift in end demand away from consumer, we continue to see scarcity value in semiconductor IP and assets and except M&A to continue to be a prevalent theme,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report.Hettenbach places Analog Devices among the company of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Broadcom (AVGO) and Microchip Technology (MCHP) as ""playing acquirers who can deliver above average (earnings per share) due to synergies.""But unlike most recent chip M&A, Analog Devices' move to acquire Linear is largely a technology play, he says.Analog Devices leads the data converter market with 40%-50% share, double that of closest rival Texas Instruments (TXN), though that company will remain much larger than the combined Analog Devices-Linear.Linear, meanwhile, is No. 3 in power management chips.""One of the long-standing knocks on Analog Devices was its lack of power management presence, the fastest-growing segment within analog,"" Hettenbach wrote in a report. ""But the Linear deal would clearly change this.""IBD'S TAKE: Analog Devices stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 60, meaning it performs in the top half of stocks in terms of key metrics. But it trails Linear stock, which has a CR of 79. Texas Instruments stock, though, leads the group with a CR of 96.Together, Analog Devices and Linear are expected to bring in $5 billion in annual sales, nearly 11% of the total $45.7 billion analog-chip market, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Tore Svanberg wrote in a report. The companies see $150 million in cost savings from their merger.Hettenbach expects those savings to yield $4.45 EPS ex items in 2018. Rosenblatt analyst Kinngai Chan sees $5 EPS ex items by the end of 2020.The acquisition cuts Analog Devices' Apple exposure by a third, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer wrote in a report. Schafer downgraded Analog Devices in December on its growing exposure to ""the inherent volatility"" associated with Apple.The Linear deal trims Analog Devices' consumer segment to 12% of sales, Schafer says.Non-consumer end markets industrial, automotive and communications have been key to Analog Devices' economic recovery over the past five years, Stifel Nicolaus' Svanberg said.After the acquisition closes, expected in mid-2017, those segments will comprise 82% of total sales, Credit Suisse's Pitzer said.Morgan Stanley's Hettenbach upgraded Analog Devices stock to overweight and boosted his price target to 78 from 56.Svanberg rates Analog Devices stock a buy, and he upped his price target to 78 from 68. Oppenheimer's Schafer has an outperform rating and 80 price target on Analog Devices stock.At the close on the stock market today, Analog Devices shares ended the day up 0.7% to close at 63.33.

224,MCHP,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp and ""less bad"" PC sales will lead to an in-line second quarter for chipmakers, but Brexit-fostered macro worries could play out in October-quarter earnings, Credit Suisse and MKM analysts said Friday.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer's top picks include Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC), Analog Devices (ADI), Lam Research (LRCX), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).""Importantly, (the second half of 2016) should be up 2.5% year over year after four quarters of year-over-year declines,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report. But overall he expects 2016 chip sales will be flat vs. earlier expectations for 3.8% growth.IBD's TAKE: IBD's 33-company Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group is currently No. 48 out of 197 groups tracked, having made big moves over the last eight weeks from No. 169. It's led by ASML in market value, but KLA-Tencor tops the group in terms of Composite Rating. KLA has a CR of 92, meaning it outperforms 92% of all stocks in key metrics.Apple iPhone suppliers -- including Broadcom and Analog Devices -- could benefit from a ""lackluster iPhone 7 cycle"" still likely to grow 55%-60% from 80 million units shipped in the first half of the year.""Overall, handsets (are) better,"" he wrote. ""Slowing Samsung Galaxy S7 and weak high-end China (are) offset by mid- to low-end iPhone 7 builds.""More PC-oriented Intel and Microchip could benefit from marginal improvements in shipments, Pitzer wrote. During Q2, units declined 4.5% vs. last year, but topped the four-quarter average of a 12% decline. Still, expectations for PC builds to fall 8% this year would be conservative.Industrial trends improved modestly over the last 90 days, but appear seasonally weaker in the second half of 2016 -- likely impacting Lam. Lam, which is trying to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), competes against ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) in the chip gear-making sector.Mellanox, on the other hand, could benefit in the second-half on infrastructure improvements by Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Mellanox's products are used to connect servers, provide storage and tie hyper-converged infrastructure -- a necessity for major cloud operations.The real risk is in Q3, when the effect of the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union are likely to play out, Pitzer says. Global stock markets toppled on the Brexit vote and Q3 expectations that are already above seasonal quarter-over-quarter growth leave plenty of room for disappointment.MKM analyst Ian Ing sees the Brexit effect slugging Xilinx (XLNX), Texas Instruments (TXN), Intersil (ISIL), ON  Semiconductor (ON) and Analog Devices -- which have high distribution-channel sales ""which are a proxy for European and industrial market exposure.""Xilinx and Texas Instruments derive about 60% of their sales through the channel, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Intersil, ON and Analog Devices take in more than half of their revenue from distribution.""Industrial markets which are served by distributors are expected to have seasonally weaker second half of demand compounded by perceived Brexit risk and uncertainty,"" Ing wrote in a report. ""Q3 and Q4 are expected to be down seasonally and likely further exacerbated by customers' Brexit uncertainties.""The most obvious effect is in currency adjustments. Following the vote, the British pound fell 9.3% vs. the U.S. dollar to its lowest point in decades. The euro fell 1.6%. That could result in some inventory destocking followed by customers scrutinizing order run rates, Ing predicts.Competitively, U.S. semiconductors have a small advantage post-Brexit.""U.K. semiconductor markets were already soft before the Brexit event,"" Ing wrote. ""Longer term, we think Brexit has some offsetting impacts on U.K. semiconductor design and activity.""

Nvidia (NVDA) soared 16.5% to 119.88 after the chip name reported another solid quarter of growth. The company has transitioned successfully into new markets like automotive and data centers, but it's still doing well in the gaming chip business where sales jumped 49% to $1.03 billion.Also in the IBD 50, Coherent (COHR), a maker of specialty laser systems, jumped 15.5% to 254.14.

230,MCHP,"X Stock futures generally pointed lower Wednesday morning following a new wave of mixed earnings and President Trump's abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey. Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips are used by Tesla (TSLA), rocketed on its earnings. Coherent (COHR), whose OLED gear makes it an Apple (AAPL) play, blew out estimates once again. Meanwhile, Snap (SNAP) on Wednesday will report Q1 figures, including Snapchat user growth, following its March IPO.Dow Jones industrial average futures retreated 0.25% below fair value. Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) shares fell on ongoing ESPN woes, though markets also could be reacting to Comey's surprise ouster and potential fallout. A key issue is how GOP and Democratic lawmakers respond, who Trump nominates as the next FBI chief and how this impacts the president's agenda on taxes, health care and more.S&P 500 futures sank about 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures were fractionally lower. U.S. crude oil futures rose 1.2%.In Tuesday's session, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 index both hit all-time highs intraday.

Coherent, which was not yet active in Wednesday's premaket, is extended from any actionable buy point.If you owned Nvidia, Coherent or Microchip (MCHP) heading into earnings, you're probably celebrating. If you owned Yelp (YELP) or Acacia Communications (ACIA), you're likely facing huge losses at Wednesday's open. Stocks can surge or crash on earnings reports. To minimize risk while still reaping the rewards, consider this earnings options strategy.Meanwhile, Snapchat operator Snap will be in the spotlight late Wednesday with its first earnings report since coming public at the start of March. The social media upstart should post another adjusted loss amid huge revenue growth. But analysts and investors will be focused on Snapchat's user growth amid concerns that Facebook (FB) has successfully cloned many of Snapchat's most popular features, especially on the Instagram app.While Snap is popular among North American teens and young adults, it's not clear if it can expand from that enviable demographic base.In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5% while China's Shanghai composite retreated 0.9% amid capital shifts there. South Korea's Kospi fell 1% in the wake of North Korea's latest nuclear bluster.

235,MCHP,"XWith Q1 earnings season kicking into high gear, it's time to build and update your watch list. Below is a look at stocks like T-Mobile (TMUS), Charter Communications (CMTR) and Chinese internet stock Weibo (WB) that expect 50% or higher EPS growth and are in or near a potential buy zone.To make the list, each stock must also trade over 200,000 shares per day and have a 90 or higher Composite Rating, meaning it's in the top 10% of all stocks in terms of the most important fundamental and technical stock-picking criteria.When this story was first published on Apr. 5, Alibaba (BABA) was on the list, with analysts calling for 51% earnings growth when it reports May 3. But the Chinese internet giant has now climbed above a proper buy zone.Tesla (TSLA) was also on the original list with a 52% EPS growth estimate, but closed Thursday just beyond the buy zone that extended to 301.87.Investment firm Apollo Global Management (APO), which held the No. 2 spot on the list with expected earnings growth of 395%, has also now moved beyond a proper buying range.Louisiana Pacific (LPX), Mastec (MTZ) and Western Digital[ticker symb=WDC] also closed Thursday trading just within their respective buy zones.Boosted by two quarters of triple-digit earnings growth, Cirrus Logic (CRUS) has been testing a 64.26 buy point in a first-stage cup, with its relative strength line floating near new high territory.TTM Technologies (TTMI), a contract manufacturer of printed circuit boards, rose nearly 9% on Apr. 4 in heavy volume after getting an upgrade from neutral to overweight from JPMorgan Chase (JPM).TTM has since pulled back and is trying to recapture its 50-day moving average as it works on a second-stage consolidation.The Costa Mesa, Calif.-based company has posted 71% average EPS growth over the last three quarters.The ""trick"" to making money during earnings season is to be prepared with an up-to-date watch list and action plan.

Davidson, Drexel Hamilton, Oppenheimer and RBC Capital Markets. On Wednesday, the Camarillo, Calif.-based company reported fourth-quarter sales and earnings above Wall Street's targets and guided analysts higher for the current quarter.Semtech reported adjusted earnings of 37 cents a share, up 118% year over year, on a 20% increase in sales to $141.8 million for the period ended Jan. 29. Analysts expected it to report adjusted earnings of 35 cents a share on sales of $140 million.

252,MCHP,"XThe Nasdaq composite rose to an all-time high Friday afternoon as the major market averages gradually moved higher and as conservative plays were showing strength.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.2%, with the S&P 500 and Dow less than 1% of their all-time bests. The small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.2% too. Volume in the quadruple witching session in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.Strength was showing up in conservative instruments. The Dow Jones utility average rose 0.7%, and top groups for the day included diversified companies, food and tobacco — all defensive plays.In IBD's Big Cap 20, the day's biggest gainer was chipmaker Microchip Technology (MCHP), up 1% in meek volume. The biggest loser was California-based Amgen (AMGN). The stock gapped down more than 6% to rub against its 50-day line on news of a drug study. The study found that Amgen's cholesterol drug Repatha cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 20%. But there was no reduction in deaths. How insurers respond to the study will be key. Amgen has had some troubles getting insurers to cover the expensive drug.Despite the big price drop, Amgen was finding support at the 50-day line. Earnings for Amgen are pedestrian — up 11% in each of the past three quarters. Revenue growth was 6%, 2% and 8% in the same quarters.The biotech stock group fell 1%, with Amgen and five other stocks in the group falling 5% or more.Chips, which constitute the No. 1 sector among 33 sectors, rose modestly. Banks, which were the No. 3 sector going into Friday's session, were mostly down.Morgan Stanley (MS) dropped nearly  2% in average volume, but the stock held above its 50-day line. Citigroup (C) fell less thawn 1% in average volume, but the stock is close to a 61.73 buy point.Texas Capital Bancshares (TCBI) pared earlier losses to trade down a fraction, holding above its 50-day line.While the action was bad, the big money centers were holding above their 50-day moving averages, the only exceptions being some of the Canadian banks. Several megacap money centers were falling in strong volume, but the volume was fading in the afternoon.Volume on a quadruple witching day — which involves the expiration of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures — often boosts volume, making interpretation difficult.Economic news was mixed Friday.The Federal Reserve's industrial production report for February came in flat vs. the consensus estimate for a 0.2% gain. Manufacturing was slightly better than expected, and capacity utilization was in line with views.The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge for March rolled in at 97.6 vs. the consensus estimate of 97.2. Leading indicators for February also topped views, 0.6% vs. 0.4%.The Baker-Hughes rig count showed that the North American tally fell almost 2% from the previous week, but rose almost 3% in the U.S.RELATED:Three Restaurant Stocks Are Closing In On Buy PointsAmgen, Rivals Drop On Study Results

253,MCHP,"Veteran semiconductor securities analyst Hans Mosesmann, who joined Rosenblatt Securities this month, initiated coverage on a range of chip stocks Wednesday. He slapped Intel (INTC) with a sell rating and gave buy ratings to three stocks on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.The IBD 50 currently lists 10 chip industry stocks, including Broadcom (AVGO), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Nvidia (NVDA), all of which Mosesmann recommends.""We are initiating coverage of the semiconductor sector today with a positive bias in an industry that is seeing moderating growth (mid-single digits), continued consolidation, and a slowing of Moore's Law,"" Mosesmann said in his research report.Key disruptive themes to watch include artificial intelligence (machine learning, deep learning and self-driving cars), cloud computing and data center growth, the emergence of compute-centric graphics processing units, and multiple bandwidth transitions including optical, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is ranked No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of superior growth stocks.In computing, Mosesmann favors the prospects of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) as the top GPU players in the market. Nvidia's investments in artificial intelligence and parallel computing give it an edge in markets like autonomous driving, he said. AMD has the opportunity to gain market share in x86 servers with its Zen processor portfolio, he said.He rates both stocks as buy with price targets of 140 for Nvidia and 16.50 for AMD.Nvidia stock slipped a fraction to 110.76 on the stock market today. But AMD stock rose 2% to 14.28, hitting its highest price since October 2007.Mosesmann said he is ""skeptical"" about Intel's prospects in computing, hence the sell rating. Intel fell 1.2% to 36.07 Wednesday.He rates Broadcom, Microchip and Texas Instruments (TXN) as buy because they are diversified, free-cash-flow-focused companies. He set price targets of 250 on Broadcom, 90 on Microchip and Texas Instruments.Broadcom stock rose 0.66% to 214.16, hitting an all-time high for the third straight trading day. Microchip rose 0.77% to 73.04. TI stock rose 15 cents to 77.23.He also set buy ratings on memory chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) and optical components firm Inphi (IPHI).

255,MCHP,"Some investors seek out high-octane growth stocks with the potential for big, fast gains. Others prefer slower, steadier companies that offer dividends and can be held for the longer term.The Income Investor column is almost tailor-made for the slow but steady crowd -- almost, because some fast-growth companies are also featured in the column from time to time.Each day, Income Investor (in today's IBD on page B9) highlights one or more companies that not only pay steady dividends but also meet key fundamental and technical criteria. The accompanying Dividend, Utility and REIT Leaders screens next to the column in IBD offers plenty of ideas, while the six minicharts above the lists provide detail about those stocks.Dividend Leaders, the broadest screen, shows names such as AT&T (T), Merck (MRK) and Philip Morris (PM) making the screen lately, thanks to their steady earnings track record and dependable dividends. Other younger tech stocks recently on the list include Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Microchip Technology (MCHP).Utility Leaders are often considered as defensive plays. When the broader market is ailing and growth stocks are getting hit, utilities tend to hold up well. Income investors can also count on a steady dividend due to utilities' reliable revenue streams. That's why utilities have topped IBD's ranking of 197 industry groups during the recent market volatility.REIT Leaders, the last screen, also offer a relative safe haven in a rocky market. Real estate investment trusts are set up in such a way that they can avoid paying corporate taxes if they pass the majority of their profits on to shareholders. They do so in the form of dividends, which is why many income investors also like REITs.While a slow economy can hurt these businesses as well, REITs also have a fairly steady revenue stream since they collect rent payments and lease proceeds from buildings or other real assets they own and operate. Due to their tax structure, they pay out most of their profits in the form of cash dividends.Keep in mind that even utility and REIT stocks can sink rapidly when the stock market goes into a deep decline. That's exactly what happened during the 2008-2009 bear decline. From July 2008 to March 2009, the Dow utility average fell 45%. So in severe situations, losses in every stock must be cut short and cash must be raised.The three screens provide annualized dividend yields and long-term dividend growth rates for each company, in the last two columns of each list. From there, investors can decide which ones they would like to research further. Most of these stocks won't look like the typical high-growth companies that are setting up for a breakout, but it's usually better to be buying and holding them when the long-term trend is up.AT&T has outperformed the market recently. The telecom giant has rallied 8% this year, after edging 2% higher in 2015. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were both slightly underwater last year and down 6% this year. AT&T, a S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, tops the Dividend Leaders list with a 5.24% yield, well above the S&P 500's average payout of 2.26%.

He also puts Texas Instruments (TXN) and Microchip Technology (MCHP) in the mix.Reuters reported Monday that Atmel is working with investment bank Qatalyst Partners.Rolland said Atmel recently issued a change of control provision that increases compensation for executives in the event of an acquisition. He raised his odds of an Atmel buyout over the next 12 months to 40% from 25%.""We believe Atmel is 2.5 times more likely to be purchased than the average U.S. semiconductor company, primarily owing to the robust accretion opportunities presented to an acquirer,"" Rolland said. ""Stepping back, we think the Street underestimates the true earnings power of Atmel given the intermediate-term cyclical recovery in the core MCU (microcontroller) business, new opportunities for IoT (Internet of Things) products, differentiation through integrated maXTouch (touchscreen controllers) and MCU combo products and new engagements for crypto-memory products.""Atmel stock has been rising fast on the rumors, amid chip industry consolidation, and is up 35% just since early May.

336,MCHP,"IIntel (INTC) needs to hit a home run with its Altera acquisition, says a Morgan Stanley semiconductor M&A; report, which adds that deals focused on cost savings and profit margins have proved the most successful for chipmakers.Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore says chip industry consolidation appears to be ""in the middle innings,"" with more acquisitions to come. Moore views Qualcomm (QCOM), Texas Instruments (TXN), Micron Technology (MU) and Microchip (MCHP) as potential buyers.Among potential targets, Moore cites Atmel (ATML), Inphi (IPHI), SanDisk (SNDK) and Cavium (CAVM).In a separate research report Thursday, FBR also identified companies such as Atmel and Cavium as buyout candidates in the consolidating chip industry.Intel announced its $16.7 billion purchase of Altera, a programmable chip specialist, on Monday. The deal follows an acquisition spree by Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO). Avago in May agreed to buy Broadcom in a $37 billion cash-and-stock deal, marking the biggest chip industry merger ever.""Acquisitions made on the basis of operational synergies and margin enhancement have the best shot to succeed,"" said Moore in his report. ""Avago is our top way to play industry M&A;, while we are negative on Intel's approach.""Besides Altera, Intel has recently acquired Lantiq and Axxia, and has bought stakes in Spreadtrum and Cloudera. But ""Intel's objective of diversifying its core microprocessor business through M&A; has not gelled,"" Moore wrote.The Morgan Stanley analyst warned that many past chip industry mergers failed to create revenue synergies. Moore says a combination of factors will drive more M&A.;He wrote: ""Intel is looking to continue monetizing its manufacturing leadership and add to its portfolio; Qualcomm may look to defend its turf and possibly look at data center opportunities; Avago has been looking for value-accretion and cost reduction-portfolio improvement opportunities; and Texas Instruments will look to add to its analog portfolio.""He also wrote, ""Micron will look to continue to consolidate memory suppliers, while Microchip will continue to diversify.""

Sales for the Data Center Group, consisting of server chips and more, rose 16% to $3.7 billion.Intel's Q3 results were driven by ""continued strength in enterprise-focused PCs and strong year-over-year growth in multiple data center segments — even 10%-plus core enterprise growth for the second consecutive quarter where recent growth has disappointed,"" Matthew Ramsay, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said in a research report Wednesday.Intel's revenue guidance for the current quarter of $14.7 billion, plus or minus $500 million, beat views.Revenue in Intel's Mobile and Communications Group, however, fell to $1 million from $51 million the previous quarter and $353 million in the year-earlier quarter.Intel has set a goal of putting more of its chips into tablet computers this year. But it has paid subsidies to hardware companies to use its tablet chips rather than chips based on designs from ARM Holdings (ARMH), which are the standard in many mobile devices. Intel's tablet initiative has increased costs, resulting in a $1.04 billion operating loss for its Mobile and Communications Group.Stephen Chin, an analyst with UBS Securities, said in a research report Wednesday that Intel's ""contra revenue"" strategy, or essentially paying tablet makers to use its chips, is showing signs of improving returns on its investment. He estimates Intel's mobile segment would have generated $300 million to $350 million in revenue in the quarter.""We expect the trajectory of MCG margins in 2015 to be a key focus of the analyst meeting on Nov. 19,"" he wrote.Chin sees Intel shipping 10 million to 12 million (tablet processors) in Q4, ending the year at 40 million to 45 million and in line with its initial target.Intel's Internet of Things business saw sales rise 14% year-over-year to $530 million.Intel also maintained its outlook for capital spending for the full year of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion.RELATED:Skyworks A Winner Inside Apple iPhone 6.

511,MCHP,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) news from last week included its push into kids’ original programming, issues related to its repair and replace policy, a counter-aggressive measure in its patent infringement case versus Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and more. Here are the details-Push into Kids ContentApple is partnering with Emmy award-winning television producer Sesame Workshop to create children's programming including live-action, animated and puppet series for its new streaming service. This is the first time it’s getting into children’s programming.Sesame Workshop is best known for its ""Sesame Street"" programming, which aired on U.S. public television network PBS for nearly 50 years and now runs on HBO, with re-runs on PBS stations, but this hugely popular show isn’t part of the deal.This is the second time in as many weeks that Apple announced a major content deal and underscores its services ambitions. Just last week, it signed on Oprah Winfrey to create ""original programs that embrace her incomparable ability to connect with audiences around the world,"" likely outbidding competitors Amazon and Netflix.Repair IssuesApple was ordered by an Australian court to pay $9 million Australian dollars ($6.7 million) in penalties for refusing free repairs to users that had earlier gone to third parties for repairs. Australian law requires repair, replacement and even at times a refund when the product sold was faulty.The problem started with at least 275 Australian customers being refused repairs between Feb 2015 and Feb 2016 for an Error 53 message on their devices. Apple earlier explained this was “an unauthorized or faulty screen replacement” message designed to protect users but later retracted the statement saying it was meant to be a factory test.Whatever be the case, the Australian regulator’s investigation drove Apple to contact 5,000 affected customers and offer to compensate them.Meanwhile in the U.S., Apple is promising its now-more-vigilant users that faulty MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards will be replaced or repaired free of cost up to four years from their date of purchase, provided that the keyboards on select models have: -Letters or characters that repeat unexpectedly- Letters or characters that do not appear when the key is pressed- Key(s) that feel ""sticky"" or do not respond in a consistent mannerIf you’ve already paid for repairs, Apple will refund your money.The problem stems from a change in the keyboard design that incorporated a “butterfly mechanism” to make the keyboard 40% thinner and more responsive. It uses V-shaped underpinnings rather than the customary X-shaped scissor connection that however affects the way the keys function, especially because of the way dust or dirt is caught inside.Qualcomm Fight DevelopmentApple has challenged four of the patents that Qualcomm accused it of infringing in a California federal court last year, saying that they didn’t cover new ideas.The patents cover ways to automatically focus a digital camera; a device that functions as both a phone and personal digital assistant; touch-sensitive displays; and circuit memory.Apple is in the habit of going to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board to cancel patents because it has an easier legal standard than courts do. In its current fiscal year ending Sep 2018, the company has filed 1,100+ such petitions.Apple Pay Enters NorwayAs promised at the last earnings call, Apple Pay has launched in the Ukraine, Poland and now, Norway. There are three supporting banks at launch including Nordea, Santander and Sbanken for customers with Visa cards. While it may not be a roaring success right at the start because of the high level of competition in the market, it is likely to attract Apple device users over time. With this launch, Apple Pay is now in 29 countries around the world.Supplier NewsHon Hai Precision Industry is the Chinese company that assembles Apple devices, or that’s how it has been more popularly known for quite some time. And yet, the company is now showing signs that its dependence on the cyclical iPhone business is going down.In 2017, around 51% of its revenues reportedly came from Apple, down from 54% in 2016. In first-quarter 2018, a weaker iPhone quarter, that revenue share is down to 45%.One-Month Price Action RecommendationApple shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

512,MCHP,"Semiconductors stocks took a huge beating in Monday’s session following reports that the Trump administration is seeking to curb many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to that country.The Treasury Department is working on the rules to block companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in ""industrially significant technology.” The measures are expected to be announced by the end of this week and are intended to counter Beijing's Made in China 2025 strategic plan. Under this plan, China wants to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology, including information technology, aerospace, electric vehicles and biotechnology (read: Inverse ETFs Surge as Trade War Fears Escalate).The move will escalate tensions between Washington and Beijing that have been on a brutal trade fight. The Washington has already threatened an import tariff on $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, of which tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods are due to take effect on Jul 6. In response, Beijing has also announced an import tariff of “the same scale and strength” with penalties on American goods worth $34 billion to come into effect on Jul 6.Concerns over Chinese investment were raised at the time when its investment in the United States is already declining. It plunged more than 90% in the first five months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier, per a CNN report.Market ImpactChip stocks were the hardest hit by escalating trade tensions with Beijing. Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, “semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52% (read: 5 Sector ETFs Most Exposed to Trade Tensions).”As such, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 3.1% at the close on Monday. Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) stole the show, plunging 6.9%. This was followed by declines of 5.3% for Marvell Technology (MRVL  -  Free Report), 5% for Smart Global (SGH  -  Free Report), 4.7% for Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), and 4.4% for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report). Other chip stocks like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report) were also down more than 3% on the day.The terrible trading in the stock world also sent the semiconductor ETFs space into deep red on the day. In particular,VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF(SMH  -  Free Report), Invesco Dynamic Semiconductors ETF (PSI  -  Free Report), iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXX) and SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD  -  Free Report) tumbled at least 3% each at the close. Below we profile these ETFs and discuss some of the specifics behind their recent slump:SMHThis fund provides exposure to 26 securities by tracking the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. It has moderated concentration across components with none accounting for more than 8.35% of assets. The product has managed assets worth $1.2 billion and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses (read: Why This Semiconductor ETF Lost Almost Half of its Assets).PSIThis fund tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index, holding 30 securities in the basket with none making up for more than 5.1% of assets. The product has so far amassed $343.9 million in its asset base while charges a bit higher fee of 63 bps per year from investors.SOXXThis ETF follows the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 30 firms with none accounting for more than 8.3% share. It has amassed $1.6 billion in its asset base and charges 48 bps in fees a year.XSDThis fund provides equal-weight exposure to 35 firms by tracking the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index. The fund has accumulated $331.8 million in AUM and charges 35 bps in fees per year.Long-Term OutlookDespite the trade tensions, the outlook for the sector is solid. After witnessing highest growth in 14 years, the global semiconductor industry is on track to grow 12.4% this year, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS).Semiconductors are the most important drivers of overall technology growth as these are used in cars, electronic gadgets, planes and weapons. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies will fuel huge growth in the space.Additionally, the deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) technology — the next wireless revolution — will likely create further opportunities. The waves of mergers and acquisitions will also provide further impetus to the space. Trump’s tax reform is another tailwind. Big semiconductor companies hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates (read: 5 Reasons to Bet on the Rebound in Semiconductor ETFs).Moreover, the above-mentioned products have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), suggesting that these will likely outperform the broader market for months.Given the solid long-term outlook but trade concerns, investors may want to consider staying on the sidelines for the time being. However, risk-tolerant, long-term investors may want to see this recent slump as a buying opportunity, provided they have the patience for extreme volatility.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

519,MCHP,"Investors who have the propensity to take higher risk can think of investing in momentum stocks to boost their gains. In this respect, the Driehaus strategy can be used to choose the best momentum stocks using the “buy high and sell higher"" theory. Eventually, Richard Herman Driehaus earned his place in Barron’s All-Century Team following the success of this investment strategy.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)• Last 5-year average EPS growth rates above 2% (Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business)• Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median (Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks)• Last four-quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5% (Positive EPS surprise indicates potential)• Positive % 50-day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks (High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend)• Momentum Score equal to or less than B (Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success)These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 7,867 stocks to only 20.Here are five of the 20 stocks:Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN  -  Free Report) is a designer of commercial and defense fully automatic transmissions for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.

520,MCHP,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.7% over the past month. MCHP hit a new 52-week high of $102.80 in the previous session. Microchip Technology has gained 16.2% since the start of the year compared to the 9.1% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 11% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 8, 2018, Microchip Technology reported EPS of $1.4 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.81%.For the current fiscal year, Microchip Technology is expected to post earnings of $6.47 per share on $5.93 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $7.65 per share on $6.61 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 18.25% and 11.34%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWhile MCHP has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Microchip Technology has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 24.3X versus its peer group's average of 15.3X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.13. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and Consensus Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and Consensus | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Microchip Technology currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Microchip Technology passes the test. Thus, it seems as though MCHP shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Microchip Technology Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Microchip Technology have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Tokyo Electron (TOELY  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Microchip Technology. Still, the fundamentals for MCHP are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.

521,MCHP,"Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP  -  Free Report) recently revised first-quarter fiscal 2019 outlook following the completion of Microsemi buyout.The company recently completed the acquisition of Microsemi for $10.3 billion. The deal worth $10.15 billion in total enterprise value was announced on Mar 1, 2018. The deal is anticipated to be immediately accretive for Microchip’s earnings on a non-GAAP basis.Management now envisions Microsemi acquisition to raise non-GAAP net sales by $160 million-$180 million. Consequently, total non-GAAP net sales are now anticipated in the range of $1.172-$1.242 billion, up from the previously guided range of $1.012-$1.062 billion. This new guided figure represents sequential growth rate to be in the range of 17% to 24%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.04 billion.Microchip also raised the guidance for earnings as it anticipates Microsemi buyout to be accretive immediately and contribute around 2-6 cents. Management now projects earnings to range between $1.41 per share and $1.55 per share. The previously anticipated range was $1.39-$1.49 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.45 per share.Shares of Microchip have gained 18.7% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 16.5%. This outperformance can primarily be attributed to solid demand witnessed by company’s product portfolio and synergies from accretive acquisitions. End-market diversification and operational efficiencies are other tailwinds.Accretive Acquistions: Key DriverRobust adoption of Microsemi’s expanding product portfolio holds promise. Moreover, Microsemi has been benefiting from strong demand for its products in data centers and aerospace & defense market.The company had been witnessing impressive performance across its end markets over the past few quarters. Growth in broadband gateway end markets has contributed positively to its communications segment in the last quarter.Further, strong satellite and space applications led to robust results in aerospace & defense market. Further, improving conditions in data centers have contributed well to top-line growth.Microchip is well poised to capitalize on Microsemi’s growth catalysts. Apart from a robust portfolio, the buyoutis likely to expand Microchip’s total addressable markets. Strong demand for Microsemi’s solutions in Data Center, Communications, Defense & Aerospace markets make us optimistic about Microchip’s long-term growth prospects.Accretive acquisitions like that of Atmel, in the recent past, have also expanded Microchip’s product portfolio and continue to aid top-line growth.Notable PointsCollaboration with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web services (“AWS”) to support AWS offerings as well as develop secure cloud systems augurs well for the company.Microchip continues to benefit from enhancing its solution range and improving capacity constraints along with design wins. This provides it a competitive edge in the semiconductor industry.Strength in cash balance enables Microchip to make lucrative acquisitions like that of Microsemi, Atmel, to mention a few. Microchip Technology Incorporated Revenue (TTM) Microchip Technology Incorporated Revenue (TTM) | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksMicrochip carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Seagate (STX  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Seagate and NVIDIA have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of approximately 18.9% and10.3%, respectively.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report)As the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, Intel has its hands in nearly every corner of the modern tech world. And as cloud computing and the Internet of Things continue to grow, Intel should continue to benefit. Plus, its broad product portfolio and diverse operations might protect investors in comparison to niche chip makers during trade war uncertainty.On top of its strong Zacks Rank, INTC is sporting “B” grades in each of the Value, Growth, and Momentum categories of our Style Scores system. Earnings growth is expected to exceed 16% this year, while revenues are projected to improve by 9%. Plus, estimates are trending higher, and Intel has generated a four-year streak of beating projections.Valuation wise, INTC certainly looks reasonably priced.

523,MCHP,"Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) was hit badly in Tuesday’s trading session following a report that a Chinese court has suspended its sale of memory products in that country, citing violation of patents held by Taiwan's United Microelectronics Corp . Shares of MU fell as much as 8% on the news but recovered slightly to close on the day at down 5.5%. The other stocks in the industry also felt the pinch.The news came amid accelerating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, with a tit-for-tat threats, which have already led to a bloodbath in the semiconductor space. This is especially true as the United States announced a 25% tariff on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods including many products in the semiconductor supply chain effective Jul 6. Additionally, Trump is seeking to curb China’s technology investments in the United States.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market. As such, a higher tariff will hit the revenues and profitably of these semiconductor manufacturers. Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, “semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%.”Long-Term OutlookDespite this, the outlook for the sector is solid. After witnessing the highest growth in 14 years, the global semiconductor industry is on track to grow 12.4% this year, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS).Semiconductors are the most important drivers of overall technology growth as these are used in cars, electronic gadgets, planes and weapons. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products -- owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies -- will fuel huge growth in the space.Additionally, the deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) technology — the next wireless revolution — will likely create further opportunities. The waves of mergers and acquisitions will also provide further impetus to the space. Trump’s tax reform is another tailwind. Big semiconductor companies hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates.Micron Versus Other StocksThe latest trade friction wiped out most of Micron’s gains made earlier in the year pushing its shares down 13.4% in a month. However, the stock is up 25.2% from a year-to-date look, and has crushed the broad electronic-semiconductor market by a wide margin. It carries a top Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a solid Growth and Value Score of A and B, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Micron saw positive earnings estimate revision of 19 cents for fiscal (ending August 2018) over the past 30 days and has an estimated whopping growth rate of 136.29%. Revenues are also expected to grow 48.25% for this year. Yet, this Idaho-based chipmaker is immensely vulnerable to tariff threats as it generates 51% of its revenues from Mainland China.Given this, we have highlighted a few other #1-Ranked semiconductor stocks that look attractive picks at present given their strong fundamentals and lower exposure to China.Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP  -  Free Report): This Arizona-based company develops, manufactures and sells specialized semiconductor products used by the customers for a wide variety of embedded control applications.

524,MCHP,"Liquidity indicates a company’s capability of meeting its debt obligations by converting its assets into liquid cash and equivalents. Companies with a favorable liquidity position have always been in demand as these are believed to have the potential to boost portfolio returns.However, one should exercise caution before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level may imply that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate than its peers, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, the efficiency level of a company should be considered in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid Stocks    Current Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio — also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may point to sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Growth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screen:Sunnyvale, CA-based Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is a leading supplier of semiconductor-based, interconnect products to world-class server, storage, and infrastructure OEMs servicing Fortune 500 data centers, the world's most powerful supercomputers, and mission critical embedded applications. The company has a Growth Score of A and delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 12.98%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings remained stable at $4.34 in the last 30 days.Chandler, AZ-based Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP  -  Free Report) develops and manufactures microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks. The company has a Growth Score of A and delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 3.85%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings improved 2.5% to $6.54 in the last 30 days.Switzerland-based Logitech International S.A. (LOGI  -  Free Report) is a global leader in peripherals for personal computers and other digital platforms, which develops and markets innovative products for PC navigation, Internet communications, digital music, home-entertainment control, video security, interactive gaming and wireless devices. The company has a Growth Score of B and delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 14.84%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings of $1.79 remained unchanged in the last 30 days.Based in San Jose, CA, Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report) is one of the largest software companies in the world, offering a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers. The company has a Growth Score of B and delivered an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 8.94%.

525,MCHP,"TiVo Corporation (TIVO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 10, after the market closes. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not the company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, the company has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice for as many misses, resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 0.72%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that TiVo is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.TiVo carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, we noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings has been revised downward over the past seven days.Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $192.6 million, which represents a 6.4% decline from the year-ago quarter. However, analysts polled by Zacks project 13.3% year-over-year growth in earnings, and reach 34 cents.TiVo Corporation Price and EPS Surprise TiVo Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | TiVo Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderTiVo has been witnessing stiff competition from Internet video providers such as Alphabet’s YouTube, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Roku, which has been negatively impacting its subscriber base. We believe rising competition to have affected the company’s to-be-reported quarter’s top-line results.Also, as a result of intensifying competition, TiVo has been increasing its operating expenses to stay ahead, which is likely to have dampened the company’s profitability. Notably, the company’s total cost and expenses flared up approximately 31% to $821.7 million in 2017 from $627.7 million incurred in 2016.A Stock With a Favorable CombinationMicrochip Technology Incorporated (MCHP  -  Free Report) is a company which has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

526,MCHP,"CA, Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 8. The company has a decent earnings surprise history. Notably, CA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while matching the same on one occasion. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of approximately 11%.What the Zacks Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.CA has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -2.32%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Nevertheless, the company is expected to record improvement in top and bottom line figures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at 60 cents per share, indicating an 11.1% increase on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are estimated to be around $1.08 billion, reflecting 7% year-over-year growth.Factors to ConsiderThe regular enhancement of IT management, software and services portfolio via innovation and acquisitions is a major positive for the company.Acquisitions have been one of the key strategies of CA to enhance its IT management, software and services portfolio. The company, last year, completed the acquisitions of Automic Holding GmbH and Veracode. Veracode recorded its highest bookings during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We believe the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by such buyouts will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.Furthermore, we are optimistic about the recently launched products. The company has also been leveraging cloud computing to construct the most competitive business applications. The company is also focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations.Additionally, the company’s “go to market” sales strategy brings together all the commercial functions, including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps lower costs, consequently improving the bottom line.However, intensifying competition, an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds remain headwinds.CA Inc.

527,MCHP,"Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP  -  Free Report) announced the pricing of two sets of unsecured senior notes offering totaling $2 billion. A $1 billion principal amount of senior notes due on Jun 1, 2021, will carry an interest rate of 3.922%. Meanwhile, the second $1 billion senior notes due on Jun 1, 2023, will carry an interest of 4.333%.The offering, subject to the fulfillment of customary closing conditions, is expected to close on May 29, 2018. The notes will be offered to qualified institutional buyers only and in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.The company plans to utilize the net proceeds from the proposed offering of the notes along with cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and its latest term loan facility, to fund the cash concerns and other amounts payable in respect of its previously announced Microsemi Corporation acquisition.Microchip expects to improve its liquidity and strengthen balance sheet through prudent investment decisions. The move provides flexibility to the company and helps meet its financial obligations in an efficient way.Also, since unsecured notes can be borrowed at lower rates, this new debt will result in lower funding cost. This is likely to boost the financial flexibility of the company which already enjoys a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity.The company exited fiscal 2018 with $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments.

531,MCHP,"Model N Inc. (MODN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on May 8.In the first quarter, Model N had delivered adjusted earnings of 3 cents per share against the year-ago quarter’s loss of 15 cents per share. The figure also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents per share.Model N surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 53.24%.Model N delivered first-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues of $39.1 million which surged 39% on a year-over-year basis and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37 million. The figure also surpassed the guided range of $37 million to $37.5 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Outlook and Zacks EstimatesModel N anticipates non-GAAP net loss in the range of 3-5 cents per share for the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of 4 cents per share, in line with the mid-point of the guided range.The company expects fiscal second-quarter 2018 GAAP revenues to come in the range of $38-$38.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $38.3 million, in line with the guided range, translating to year-over-year growth of 15.21%.Notably, Model N’s shares have returned 9.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 5.7%.Strengthening Revenue Cloud: Key CatalystModel N’s Revenue Cloud offering for med-tech, pharma, semiconductor, manufacturing and high tech companies remains a positive.During the quarter, Model N introduced Revenue Management platform to enhance digital reinvention experience. The company also launched Model N CPQ (Configure, Price and Quote), Model N Channel Cloud and Revenue Cloud for High Tech suites.The new solutions will ensure that customers smoothly transform business digitally and realize business goals by keeping their functioning updated.

The company’s solutions provide higher Return on Investment (“ROI”) as well as plug gaps in the end-to-end revenue management process that legacy systems fail to do. This improves top-line growth of the companies, consequently bolstering adoption of Model N’s solutions.Other Factors to ConsiderThe integration of Revitas, completed during fiscal 2017, has expanded Model N’s product suite and customer base.SaaS & Maintenance revenues of $32.3 million grew 43% year over year in the last quarter. The company continues to make steady progress in its transformation to a 100% Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based model. This move will boost the top line, going forward. However, the transformation is likely keep the bottom line under pressure, while considering the second-quarter performance.In the first quarter the company won several deals in high tech and life sciences including the likes of DexCom, Amgen, Tiro, CSL, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Seagate (STX  -  Free Report). This bodes well for Model N’s top-line growth.However, increasing competition from well-established players like salesforce.com and Workday remains a headwind. Increasing expenditure to develop products is likely to hurt margins at least in the near-term.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

532,MCHP,"Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) is trying to pacify employees about its relationship with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) even as it embarks on a new journey with blockchain and completes strategic acquisitions and deals. Here’s the low-down:ICE Contract And The Child Separation PolicyThe technology sector, by virtue of the talent it has attracted from all over the world, has helped the U.S. lead the world. But that also means it has the largest number of immigrant workers. That’s probably why it has been the one most attacked on immigration issues and the one that has had to take the most defensive stand.   So it isn’t surprising that the government’s zero tolerance policy and the lack of a policy on reunification elicited unsupportive comments from all technology leaders. Microsoft’s case was no different.The policy itself isn’t anything new: it entails temporary separation of the family while the parents are either prosecuted and/or the identity of the children as belonging to the family is confirmed. But more stringent enforcement is likely what the government was attempting to do when it reportedly separated as many as 2,000 children from those claiming to be their parents. In any case, the President has since signed an executive order forbidding the separation.  Microsoft was charged by its employees on the basis of a blog post from January where it praised the U.S. ICE for “implementing transformative technologies for homeland security and public safety, and adding that “we’re proud to support this work with our mission-critical cloud.”That blog also said that the ICE would be able to “process data on edge devices or utilize deep learning capabilities to accelerate facial recognition and identification” that “help employees make more informed decisions faster.” This is actually an ideal situation that could minimize the plight of immigrants, but the company has now stepped on the back foot.Nadella’s letter to employees says, “Our current cloud engagement with ICE is supporting legacy mail, calendar, messaging and document management workloads.” It also says, “I want to be clear: Microsoft is not working with the U.S. government on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border.”Deploying BlockchainMicrosoft has collaborated with consulting firm EY to build a blockchain tool based on the Quorum permissioned distributed ledger (a system that uses a smaller network of nodes to validate transactions thereby saving system resources).The company claims that the technology can be used by authors, software developers and other creators to collect royalties. If true, it would eliminate a host of middlemen and be greatly beneficial for creators, IP holders and other licensors.Microsoft intends to start using the technology in its online gaming system and is already working with Ubisoft for implementation. The companies believe that this will enable them to process millions of transactions a day, so payments can be made daily instead of the current 45 days.“The scale, complexity and volume of digital rights and royalties transactions makes this a perfect application for blockchains. A blockchain can handle the unique nature of each contract between digital rights owners and licensors can be handled in a scalable, efficient manner with an audit trail for the participants,” according to Paul Brody, EY’s Global Innovation Leader for Blockchain.AI Deal with M&SBritain’s Marks & Spencer Group has partnered with Microsoft to jump-start the digitization of its operations. The company is particularly interested in Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that it intends to incorporate in its stores, as well as across its other operations.Microsoft’s retail prowess came into focus last week with the company announcing its own self-checkout system. Since this too will improve customer experience, M&S may the one of the first to adopt the technology. However, neither company offered details of their collaboration plans.Marks & Spencer CEO Steve Rowe did however put out a statement that said, “We want to be at the forefront of driving value into the customer experience using the power of technology,” and, “Working together with Microsoft to understand the full potential of how technology and artificial intelligence can improve the in-store experience for our customers and the efficiencies of our wider operations could be a game-changer for M&S — and for retail.”Acquiring Social Learning Platform FlipgridMicrosoft has acquired a startup that makes a rather popular app for educators. Called Flipgrid, the app allows people to make videos on any topic for easy sharing with others. The Minneapolis-based startup has less than 30 employees that currently serve 20 million users. Last year, it reported an 800% increase in teacher accounts.While losing a leadership position to Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) chromebooks and other classroom tools, Microsoft has always put out products to ensure that it remained in contention. As far as Flipgrid is concerned, the company promises to maintain the brand and allow it to operate across platforms. It is offering the product free for now to anyone who’s willing to use it and schools that already have subscriptions will be refunded on a pro rata basis.The attraction for Flipgrid is of course Microsoft’s resources that will enable it to scale and better reach students and teachers across the world.Acquiring AI Startup BonsaiMicrosoft has finally bought the reinforcement learning startup called Bonsai for an undisclosed sum. Last year, it invested in the company through its Microsoft Ventures unit, now called M12. At the time, ABB, Samsung and Siemens also invested in the company to raise $7.6 million, taking its total funding to $13.6 million.The Berkeley-based startup has 42 employees, all of whom will be moving to Microsoft. The company has previously done some work in the energy, HVAC, robotics and autonomous vehicle sectors. Last year, it developed a new technique for programming industrial control systems that was 45X faster than the competing solution from Google.Reinforcement learning allows a developer to teach a system through a trial and error process by creating a simulated environment. It therefore allows both AI engineers and those less experienced to get involved in the training process.Microsoft is betting that AI adoption will be so fast that there will be a skills gap. So the ability to get more people on the job will be a valuable asset.One-Month Price Performance RecommendationsMicrosoft shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

533,MCHP,"The technology sector, which has showed its immense strength against the trade and tariff threats recently on the FANG surge, has lost its ground following news of a potential curb in Chinese investment. In fact, the sector pushed Wall Street even lower on Jun 27 with the S&P 500 Technology Sector dropping 1.5% and Philadelphia semiconductor index sliding 2.5%.What Happened?The Trump administration is seeking to limit many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to that country. The Treasury Department is working on the rules to block companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in ""industrially significant technology.” The measures are expected to be announced by the end of this week and are intended to counter Beijing's Made in China 2025 strategic plan. Under this plan, China wants to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology, including robotics, aircraft and aircraft components, advanced rail equipment, electrical-generation and transmission equipment and pharmaceuticals and advanced medical devices.As such, the potential move would hurt the tech sector more broadly than just the semiconductors and hit revenues, earnings and stock prices of the tech titans having significant exposure to China.Solid OutlookHowever, the outlook for the technology sector has been encouraging. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts.Additionally, the twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher. Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle.How to Buy the DipGiven encouraging long-term trends, investors could definitely tap the current dip in the stocks. While there are many stocks in the space having a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), we have highlighted six big technology names (market cap of more than $10 billion) that have seen their Rank surging to the top rank.All these are backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others and have a potential to beat the ongoing trade turmoil.

534,MCHP,"For the Global Week Ahead, here are five Reuters themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders alike.I list them in importance to equity markets.(1) Where will U.S. earnings go from here?Amid trade wars signs of slowing economic growth, world markets remain relatively robust. Bumper U.S. company earnings are part of the reason.Thanks to tax-cut tailwinds, Q1 earnings growth clocked in at 26.6 percent and the second quarter, starting next week, should moderate only slightly, to 20.7 percent.However, the season is being clouded by trade tensions and their impact on corporate profits. So analysts will closely scrutinize outlook statements to see whether to adjust numbers for the rest of 2018. Right now, 23.4 percent earnings growth is forecast for the third quarter and 20.2 percent for the fourth.Financials stocks won big from the tax cuts — their Q1 bottom lines were possibly fattened by as much as $5 billion, many estimate. So, eyes will be on Wells Fargo, Citi and JPMorgan reports on Friday, July 13th. Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S forecast banks’ Q2 growth at 22 percent.But numbers are seen less toppy next year, slimming to 7.3 percent in the first quarter and just over ten percent for the three subsequent quarters.(2) Central bank heads speakThe Fed is pressing ahead with raising interest rates, global financial conditions are tightening and investors are nervous about the global economy. Emerging markets are under the cosh and bond yield curves are flattening — the U.S. yield curve is less than 30 basis points from inversion, the signal that recession is coming.This is the backdrop to a series of speeches this week from some of the world’s most powerful central bankers — Bank of Japan governor Kuroda, European Central Bank chief Draghi, Bank of England boss Carney and Bank of Canada’s Poloz all take the stand. The BoC will likely also raise interest rates next week.Here’s the balance they will try to strike: signal an exit from crisis-era stimulus but not so fast that growth and investor confidence will plummet. It won’t be easy. As it stands, the current economic expansion and bull market are very long in the tooth. Fed tightening alone could be enough to end them both.(3) More emerges from the start of a U.S./China Trade WarAs U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports kick in, President Donald Trump is threatening to tax goods worth $500 billion — roughly the value of all U.S. imports from China in 2017.What could Beijing do to ease the impact on its economy?In theory, it could ease policy. It has also subtly hinted at using yuan depreciation as a retaliatory tool, by allowing the currency to post its biggest monthly loss on record in June.Though capital outflows are a risk. Upcoming data will provide a crucial insight into China’s economy — the weekend brings the latest FX reserves picture; consumer and factory inflation figures emerge on July 10; trade data due July 13 will show if trade angst had already hit exports and imports in June. All that will set markets up for Q2 GDP due the following week.Tensions with Washington may already have slowed economic growth, Reuters polls predict.(4) Teresa May and Brexit make headlinesBritain’s markets are in for another bumpy ride next week. They will be digesting the outcome of a crunch Brexit showdown at the government’s country retreat on Friday.Resignations, rebellions and coup plots have all been rumored if Prime Minister Theresa May doesn’t back a clean break from the EU. At the same time, British industrial giants are sounding shrill warnings of mass exodus if EU trade ties are lost.May will then get a visit from Germany’s Angela Merkel on Tuesday — assuming she hasn’t been ousted by then. Merkel’s visit is part of a Western Balkans summit where, ironically, the main agenda is EU integration. But she will make time for a Brexit powwow with May.And it’s not just politics. On Tuesday, Britain publishes monthly growth estimates for the first time, a move intended to give policymakers more timely information about the economy. The numbers will be released alongside output data for the services, industrial and construction sectors, and trade figures.(5) WTI crude oil pricesComing days may bring more volatility to oil markets too.They have already been on a rollercoaster, rising almost to $80 per barrel after output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies.OPEC has agreed to ease output curbs but prices are receiving fresh impetus from Washington’s new sanctions against Tehran. Those, in turn, have led Iran’s Revolutionary Guards to threaten a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil artery through which a fifth of the world’s oil consumption passes. Tensions are running high, with the U.S. Navy standing ready to ensure free navigation through the channel.High oil prices are wiping out any benefits the U.S. economy might enjoy from Trump’s tax cuts. But while he has lashed out at the cartel and urged it to raise production, he is also pressuring governments to stop Iranian purchases. Such rhetoric may push oil prices higher still. As will any outbreak of hostilities in Hormuz.???Top Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stocks—Glencore (GLNCY  -  Free Report): This is a $62B market cap mining stock. Oil and natural resource stocks like this are popping up in the top Zacks Rank these days. At $8.65 a share, this one may be cheap too. The long-term Zacks VGM score of A is attractive.Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report): This is a $22B semiconductor (analog and mixed) company. Where do the chip companies go with the U.S.-China trade war on?

536,MCHP,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) has been temporarily banned from selling chips in China. This dealt a severe blow to the stock price of the chipmaker, with other chip stocks following suit.But, the red-hot chip stock is, undoubtedly, ready to make a comeback. Micron, the world’s leading provider of innovative memory solutions, has had a mind-boggling run so far this year. The stock has gained 25%, compared with a 3.6% rise of the PHLX Semiconductor Index and 1.5% of the S&P 500.The chip industry, in itself, offers upside even after stellar years. From high-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) to automation demand for chips, all are skyrocketing. Meanwhile, supply is low which spells a grand period for chip stocks. Hence, it is the ideal time to capitalize on the current slump by betting on chip stocks that are poised to grow in the near term.Micron Stock Dives as China Blocks SalesChina’s Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court has issued an authoritative warning against Micron’s Chinese holdings blocking sales of PRC 26 DRAM and NAND-linked items. This included solid-state hard drives and memory sticks. The Boise, ID-based company’s subsidiaries like the Micron Semiconductor (Xi’an) Co were earlier charged for patent infringement by Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. (Jinhua) and Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. was slapped with the same charges.Micron is already embroiled in a trade war between the United States and China, when the Chinese regulators launched an investigation into memory-chip pricing. Nonetheless, shares of the chipmaker tanked 5.5% to close at $51.48 on Jul 3 after hitting an intra-day low of $50.10. Markets remained closed on Jul 4 as the nation observed Independence Day.Shares of other semiconductor stocks did suffer due to the tussle between the Asian nation and Micron. China is fighting for advanced chip technology and knowhow, while the Trump administration intends to block additional technology exports to Beijing. Chipmakers, including Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), saw their shares decline 1.5%, 2.2% and 1.5% on Jul 3, respectively. The PHLX Semiconductor Index went down 1.8%, after the Chinese court ruling came out.  Micron Still Has Upside Potential, But Why?But, it isn’t doomsday for Micron or the semiconductor industry. Micron does generate half of its revenues from China, per Fact Set. However, semiconductors are components of products that are sold elsewhere added Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Thus, the adverse effect of high revenue exposure to China “is not as meaningful” as it can be for other industries. Micron’s chief financial officer Dave Zinsner forecasts fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.23 to $3.37 a share on revenues of $8 billion to $8.4 billion, better than analysts’ projection of $3.16 on sales of $8.02 billion. In fact, the chipmaker’s fiscal third-quarter 2018 profits more than doubled from the year-ago levels, while sales surged 40%. The chipmakers net income of $3.82 billion, or $3.10 per share, on sales of $7.8 billion, was up from $5.57 billion a year ago.And luckily for investors, top analysts are optimistic about further growth ahead. Top benchmark analyst Mike Burton said that “MU has progressed from a ‘cash burn’ to a ‘cash return’ story in only two years, and we expect the stock to remain a cyclical growth name, generating increasing profits and cash flow on each respective high and low of the memory cycle.” He has raised his price target to $80 per share (55% upside potential from the current price).Micron bear UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri has upgraded the stock from “Sell” to “Hold” and raised his price target from $42 to $60 (16.5% upside potential from the current price).Semiconductor Industry in the PinkBut, why just buy Micron? Semiconductor chips are much in demand, largely due to gaming, emergence of IoT and automation.E-sports, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, needs thousands of semiconductor chips for production, while chips are an essential part of crypto mining as these provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms.5 Solid Chipmakers for Your Portfolio Banking on the strengths, chipmakers are positioned to make a comeback in the near term. Since the long term bodes well for stocks after the initial dip, it will be wise to invest in such stocks. Furthermore, by purchasing stocks right after a dip, investors are essentially buying shares at a discount. We have, thus, short-listed five stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Micron Technology provides semiconductor systems. The stock currently has a Zacks Rank 1.

540,MCHP,"The Q1 earnings season will see releases from a number of semiconductor companies over the next few days. The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.According to the latest Earnings Preview, technology is one of the six sectors predicted to report double-digit earnings growth this quarter. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 28.5% on 12.6% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.We believe the aforementioned trends have provided some much-needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to counter loss of business due to the declining PC market, which still consumes the bulk of the chips. Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017.The semiconductor industry is anticipated to continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017 but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, representing growth of 7.7%.The industry is poised to benefit from rising demand for new technologies, deployment of 5G broadband technology globally and President Trump’s pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let’s see what’s in store for the following semiconductor stocks, all of which are slated to release quarterly figures on May 8.Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2018 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.35 per share while the same for revenues stands at $984.5 Million.

This will provide customers with accurate information about the product that they are looking to buy with enhanced picture of it on their mobile. This is likely to boost the customer base of the company.Further, the company’s strong focus on enhancing the portfolio of blockchain securities bodes well with the emerging trend of blockchain across the world. DeSoto, Bitt and tZERO are expected to perform well and drive results in the quarter under review.Moreover, Overstock’s decision of selling off its home e-commerce business will benefit the company in focusing more on its core retail as well as blockchain business.Additionally, its FinTech investments portfolio which is comprised of investments in those companies which are leveraging blockchain technology remain positive for the company’s gaining momentum in the market.Overstock’s tZERO platform is likely to drive the top-line in the going-to-be reported quarter, courtesy given to its initial coin offering. Recently, tZERO unveiled a prototype for its soon-to-be-launched token trading platform, which remains positive.We believe these endeavors will continue to benefit the company’s results in the quarter under review. However, intensifying competition in the retail sector poses a serious threat to the company’s market position.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Overstock will beat earnings this quarter.

Price and EPS Surprise Gogo Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gogo Inc. Quote  Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayNotably, Gogo shares have lost 15.8% year to date, compared with the industry’s decline of 11.7%. The underperformance can be attributed to Gogo’s inability to deliver profits. Moreover, lack of visibility around the business model is a concern.However, Gogo operates in a sector (in-flight connectivity) that presents significant growth opportunities, which bodes well for the company.Gogo’s 2Ku service has been the chief growth driver. Increasing bandwidth through installation of more 2Ku aircraft online is expected to boost take rates, driving top-line growth and improves profitability.Moreover, launch of products like GOGO TV and Gogo Vision Touch in 2017 are also anticipated to gain traction.With the introduction of AVANCE L5 and L3, Gogo anticipates to expand its market share in the Business Aviation segment. Notably, the company has already installed 100 AVANCE L5 systems, within six months of availability.During the quarter, Gogo announced that Aeromexico will install 2Ku on an additional nine Boeing 737-800NG's, bringing the total to 29 aircraft.However, higher operating expenses due to increase in investment in engineering, design and development as well as sales and marketing pose concerns.Moreover, de-installation of American Airlines aircraft will impact the CA-NA segment. The company plans to replace these ATG aircrafts with satellite based ones. The newly installed aircrafts will have lower ARPUs compared with the de-installed ones, which is a headwind.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

The bottom line for the sector is projected to increase 27.9% on 12.5% higher revenues, which would follow the previous quarter’s earnings and revenue growth of 24.2% and 11.1%, respectively.The encouraging growth projections can be mainly attributed to the rising demand for cloud-based platforms, rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT)-related software and hardware.Moreover, a stabilizing PC-market coupled with improved IT spending outlook bodes well for the tech sector.Therefore, now it is wise to invest in such stocks, in order to catch the post-earnings rally.

546,MCHP,"Zynga  is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2.The company’s earnings have lagged the Zack Consensus Estimate in one of the trailing four quarters, recording an average negative surprise of 25%.In the last reported quarter, the company reported earnings of 2 cents per share, which were in line with the consensus estimate.Revenues increased 22.4% year over year to $233.3 million. The top-line performance was strongest since first-quarter 2013, primarily driven by the successful launch of Words With Friends 2, growing live services and robust performance from CSR Racing 2 (CSR2) and Zynga Poker. Zynga Inc.

Moreover, adjusted EBITDA is projected at $20 million, while net loss is anticipated to be $5 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderZynga benefits from the surge in mobile gaming audience. In the fourth quarter, mobile revenues surged 32% year over year to $203.6 million. Mobile Daily Active (DAU) base increased 24% year over year to 20 million, driven primarily by Solitaire and Zynga Poker.The company’s increasing payer conversion rate driven by games like CSR2 and Zynga Poker is a key catalyst. Further, Zynga anticipates advertising revenues to grow year over year.The company’s continuing investments on new emerging gaming platforms like chat and AR is positive. Moreover, the acquisition of Peak Games strengthened the company’s casual card game portfolio with the addition of popular mobile card games such as Spades Plus and Gin Rummy Plus.Moreover, operating expenses are projected to increase year over year, primarily driven by higher marketing spend on the company’s live services and higher G&A expenses, offset by R&D cost. This is expected to hurt margins in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

547,MCHP,"Fortinet Inc. (FFIV  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3.In the last-reported quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 10.3%. Notably, Fortinet has a strong earnings surprise history. The company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 20.1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Fortinet is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses the two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Fortinet carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.70%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter earnings is pegged at 24 cents, which indicates a massive 41.2% year-over-year jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged, over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $390.8 million, up 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.Fortinet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fortinet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fortinet, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayWe expect Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to a subscription-based service provider to have driven the company’s bottom-line results in Q1. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generated more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 50-basis-point gross-margin expansion in 2017. We believe this strategy will continue to improve the company’s top and bottom-line performances.Nonetheless, the company’s sluggish revenue growth rate makes us cautious about its to-be-reported quarter top-line performance. Notably, over the last six quarters, the company’s revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than the previous rates of more than 30%. Additionally, Fortinet’s first-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 13.6-15.4%.The company observed that organizations have been breaking the cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time instead of making a single large investment. Therefore, the above-mentioned factor is likely to have affected the first-quarter revenues, the negative impact of which might have trickled down the bottom as well.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

549,MCHP,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 9% over the past month. MLNX hit a new 52-week high of $80.55 in the previous session. Mellanox Technologies has gained 22.7% since the start of the year compared to the 2.7% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 13.9% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 17, 2018, Mellanox Technologies reported EPS of $0.98 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.83 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.67%.For the current fiscal year, Mellanox Technologies is expected to post earnings of $4.07 per share on $1.04 billion in revenues. This represents a 78.51% change in EPS on a 20.72% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.53 per share on $1.12 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.28% and 7.84%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMellanox Technologies may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for MLNX? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Mellanox Technologies has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 19.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 26.7X versus its peer group's average of 12.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.3. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. Price and Consensus  Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. Price and Consensus | Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Mellanox Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Mellanox Technologies fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though MLNX shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does Mellanox Technologies Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Mellanox Technologies have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including SMART Global Holdings (SGH  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report), and Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Mellanox Technologies. Still, the fundamentals for MLNX are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week-high.

552,MCHP,"The semiconductor industry is very well poised to benefit from all the major technology trends such as cloud computing, IoT, self-driving cars, drones, industrial and other automation, smart cities, 5G Internet, you name it. That’s because none of these things can be operational without these little integrated circuits serving to store, process, transport, transmit or receive information. As we move towards a more connected world where humans not only talk to each other, but also to their machines and machines also increasingly talk to each other, the need for semiconductor devices can only increase hereafter.So it’s not hard to imagine that there would be investment opportunities in the segment and that’s what this article is about. To make the investment decision easier, I’ve picked on companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can also see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. They also have a VGM score A.As many Zacks.com readers already know, the VGM score essentially captures the investment style (and therefore also the risk appetite) and breaks down as the value-growth-momentum score. So if a stock has a Value score A, value investors should be interested in that stock, if it has a Growth Score A, it would be ideal for growth investors and so on. So a VGM score of A indicates that no matter what your investment style, you should take a look at these stocks:   Ichor Holdings Ltd. (ICHR  -  Free Report)Fremont-based Ichor Holdings is engaged in the design, engineering and manufacturing of critical gas and chemical delivery subsystems used in the etch, deposition, electroplating and cleaning processes of semiconductor manufacturing. It operates in the U.S., UK, Singapore and Malaysia. The company had its IPO at the end of 2016, so supporting numbers are limited. But it’s encouraging to note that:2017 earnings estimate up 48.5% from Jan 2017 to $2.422018 earnings estimate up 54.1% from Jan 2017 to $2.85In the December 2016 quarter, it missed estimates, following that up with a beat in the March quarter and a match in the June quarter, so not a great track record just yet.However, given the capital intensive nature of the business, it’s encouraging to note that the debt-to-total capital ratio is just 17.9% and that the company has a current ratio of 1.79X, a quick ratio of 0.96X and a book value per share of 7.0X.As far as valuation is concerned, the P/E based on forward 12 months earnings shows a median value of 11.2X for ICHR compared to 12.4X for the industry and 17.9X for the S&P 500.MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation (MX  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chungbuk, South Korea, MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation operates as a designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products for high-volume consumer applications. It operates through the Display Solutions, Power Solutions and Semiconductor Manufacturing Services segments. So in addition to consumer markets like LCD, LED and 3D televisions and displays, mobile PCs, and mobile communications and entertainment devices, it also offers specialty analog and mixed-signal foundry services for fabless semiconductor companies.While MagnaChip’s 2017 earnings estimate continues to trend down, the estimate for 2018 is up 32.8% since March. This isn’t surprising since management has more or less completed a big headcount reduction plan, most of the severance and other cost related to which has already been charged to profit and from which it’s currently expected that there will be annualized cost savings in the $23-27 million range. The gross margin is also trending up although not much of this is falling to the bottom line yet because of necessary investments in opex.The valuation is also encouraging with the P/E based on forward 12 months earnings showing a median value of 12.5X for MX compared to 18.4X for the industry and 17.9X for the S&P 500.Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, Microchip Technology develops and manufactures specialized semiconductor products including microcontrollers, application-specific standard products (ASSPs) and related mixed-signal and memory products for embedded control applications. The company markets its products to the consumer, automotive, office automation, communications and industrial markets. There’s an upward trend in its estimate revisions:2017 earnings estimate up 29.6% from Jan 2017 to $5.262018 earnings estimate up 22.2% from Jan 2017 to $5.67The surprise history shows that MCHP has consistently topped earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 10.2%.Also, revenues have grown consistently over the last five years with both revenue and gross margin picking up momentum over the last few quarters. The company has been building operating leverage that could help it sustain the current rate of EBIT margin expansion. The per-share book value consequently jumped up in 2016 and appears to be stabilizing now. Encouragingly, this hasn’t had a negative impact on the asset turnover, which continues to rise. Additionally, while debt levels jumped up in 2015 and in the first quarter or 2016, they have stabilized since. As a result, the debt to total capital ratio, which increased through 2015 and stabilized in 2016, is now coming down.On the valuation side, the stock is attractive because its P/E based on forward 12 months earnings shows a median value of 17.9X compared to 18.4X for the industry and 17.9X for the S&P 500.    Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology of Malvern, Pennsylvania is a leading manufacturer and supplier of discrete passive and active electronic components, particularly resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes and transistors. It offers one of the most comprehensive electronic component lines of any manufacturer in the U.S. or Europe. Its estimate revisions are trending up:2017 earnings estimate up 28.8% from Apr 2017 to $1.342018 earnings estimate up 65.8% from Apr 2017 to $1.41The company topped estimates in two of the last four quarters while doubling quarterly earnings over the last two years.Other encouraging numbers include a debt to total capital ratio of just 20.3%, a constantly improving return on assets of 5.2, a relatively steady book value per share of 11.8X and a growing per-share net cash of 4.8X.From the valuation perspective, Vishay is worth looking at because its P/E based on forward 12 months earnings shows a median value of 14.4X compared to 25.8X for the industry and 17.9X for the S&P 500.Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report)Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology has established itself as one of the leading providers of semiconductor memory solutions in the world, serving the computer and computer-peripheral manufacturing, consumer electronics, CAD/CAM, telecommunications, office automation, network and data processing, and graphics display markets.2017 earnings estimate up 108.1% from Jan 2017 to $4.622018 earnings estimate up 141.9% from Jan 2017 to $6.00The company topped estimates in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 23.1%.Micron is seeing very strong demand, leading to solid revenue growth and even stronger gross profit growth. Opex is also stabilizing, leading to very strong growth in EBIT over the last few quarters. The company does have considerable debt, but the debt cap at a little over 40% is manageable.From the valuation perspective, Micron is attractive because its trailing twelve months P/S shows a median value of 2.0X compared to 2.1X for the industry and 3.0X for the S&P 500.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

553,MCHP,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT.

The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

557,MCHP,"Dividend growth stocks lead to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.

558,MCHP,"Investors have been on the edge since Trump hinted at possibilities of missile attacks on Syria. As tensions gradually eased with the U.S. President clarifying that attacks (if at all) were not imminent, the market took a breather with bank stocks leading the rebound on solid earnings expectations.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that rake in higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screen:Microchip Technology Incorporated (MCHP  -  Free Report): Incorporated in Delaware in 1989, Microchip develops and manufacturers microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks.

559,MCHP,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

561,MCHP,"Dividend is a major source of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk.Dividend paying stocks are primarily mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market. Their market leading position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity allow them to offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and more scope for capital appreciation as opposed to those that pay high yields.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a future hike is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broad stock market or any other dividend paying stocks, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.Here are the screening parameters that could result in a winning dividend growth portfolio:5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for a better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Zacks Rank Less than 2: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.

565,MCHP,"The third-quarter 2017 reporting cycle is showing positive trends with impressive revenue growth and favorable estimate revisions.Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings of the 327 S&P 500 members who have already reported are up 7.8% on a year-over-year basis (74.9% of the companies beat EPS estimates). Total revenues are up 6.5% (65.7% of the companies beat top-line estimates).Third-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 5.5%. However, considering the double-digit earnings growth in the last two quarters and an anticipated growth rate of 7.3% in the fourth quarter, the third-quarter earnings growth rate is the lowest.Notably, the Industrial Products, Technology, Construction and Medical sectors are turning out to be better performers. However, the Finance sector’s performance is below average in the quarter.Technology Earnings So FarNotably, the sector is benefiting from increasing demand for data centers and cloud-based platforms.

567,MCHP,"The semiconductor space remained largely unaffected by the broad market sell-off seen in early February. This is because the semiconductor industry is clearly leading the broad technology space this year on encouraging fundamentals, solid corporate earnings, strong outlook and investors’ continued appreciation of value-centric traditional stocks. The rally has strengthened courtesy of a series of consolidation, which pushed several chip stocks and ETFs to new highs.Below we discuss some strong reasons for investing in semiconductor ETFs.Hot TrendsSemiconductors  are the most important driver of overall technology growth as these are used in cars, electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies are fueling huge growth in the space (read: How to Invest in the Hottest Technologies With ETFs).Additionally, the deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) technology – the next wireless revolution - will likely create further growth opportunities.Encouraging FundamentalsThe twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are also pushing chip stocks higher. This is because companies like Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. Additionally, most of the chipmakers are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase shareholder payouts. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically performs well in a maturing economic cycle.ConsolidationThe semiconductor space has been witnessing an increase in mergers and acquisitions talks. The latest development is that Intel might launch an offer to acquire Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), which was running after Qualcomm for months and now Trump has blocked its $117 billion bid due to national security concerns. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is trying to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NXPI, which was announced in October 2016 (read: Broadcom Launches Bid for Qualcomm: Semiconductor ETFs Surge).Marvell Technology Group (MRVL  -  Free Report) is also in the process of acquiring smaller rival Cavium Inc. CAVM.O for about $6 billion. The transaction is expected to be completed by mid-2018. Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report) also announced to buy Microsemi Corp  for $8.35 billion early this month. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.Strong OutlookAfter generating record annual sales in 2017, the global semiconductor industry  begun 2018 on a strong note, posting its highest-ever January sales and 18th consecutive month of year-over-year sales increase, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS). The agency expects global semiconductor revenues to rise 7% year over year in 2018.Per Gartner, worldwide semiconductor revenues are expected to grow 7.5% to $451 billion this year buoyed by higher prices for both DRAM and NAND flash memory.Impressive EarningsPer the latest Earnings Trends report, earnings growth for the broad technology sector turned out to be very strong, with total Q4 earnings up 23.7% on 11.1% higher revenues. Semiconductors have contributed the most with 68.8% earnings growth, followed by 51.1% growth in miscellaneous technology (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Cheap ValuationPer a MarketWatch article, semiconductors, as a group, are still cheaper than the S&P 500. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is now trading at 16.1 times the consensus earnings estimates for the next 12 months, while the S&P 500 is trading at 17 times the estimates.ETFs to TapIn view of the reasons discussed above, we strongly believe that investors should consider semiconductor ETFs. Below, we have highlighted them. All these have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy):iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 30 firms with heavy concentration on the top five firms accounting for a combined 38.3% share.

Management expects to achieve normal lead times by June 2018.Quarter DetailsIn terms of product line, microcontroller business (66.5% of net sales) increased 18.9% year over driven by robust demand for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.Microchip unveiled a single-wire, Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) device, which will help in remote identification of electronic components.The company also launched Crypto Authentication device, which will allow developers to integrate hardware-based security to their designs. Additionally, it announced a third-party security design partner program.In the quarter, Microchip announced that it has improved response time for critical system events to help designers create CAN-based applications, without any added complexity.Additionally, the company expanded collaboration with Amazon Web services (AWS) to support AWS offerings as well as develop secure cloud systems.However, analog sales (23.3% of net sales) were down 3.2% on a sequential basis. Revenues were hurt by capacity constraint at Atmel. Moreover, the company’s intent to offer total system solutions that combines microcontroller cores with analog products and connectivity firmware negatively impacted sales. Revenue recognition for these products was shifted from analog business to the microcontroller business.Still management believes that the higher margin total system solutions will help Microchip retain customers and win new designs in the long haul. According to the company, improving capacity constraints along with design wins will enable the analog business to expand at a higher rate than Microchip.Memory sales (4.8% of net sales) were down 7.6% on a quarter-over-quarter basis.Licensing (2.8% of net sales) sales increased 6.8% sequentially and 15.5% on a year-over-year basis.In the reported quarter, MMO revenues came in at $26 million and accounted for 2.6% of net sales.Geographically, Asia remained Microchip’s largest market with 60% of net sales coming from the region. Europe and Americas contributed 23% and 17%, respectively.Operating DetailsMicrochip posted non-GAAP gross margin of 61.4%, which expanded 360 bps on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, were down 300 bps year over year and 50 bps sequentially to 22%. The decline was primarily due to lower research & development (R&D) expenses and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses, which decreased 170 bps and 130 bps, respectively.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 660 bps from the year-ago quarter and 80 bps sequentially to 39.4%.Balance SheetCash generated in the reported quarter was $365 million compared with $350.1 million in the previous quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, cash and total investment position was $1.985 billion compared with $1.84 billion in the previous quarter.Management noted that inventory on Dec 31, 2017, was at 115 days, up by 10 days from the September quarter level.The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 36.30 cents per share, which is payable on Mar 6, 2018.GuidanceMicrochip forecasts fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 net sales in the range of $964.4-$1,004.1 million.Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated in the range of 61.3-61.7%, which is based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of sales, are projected in the 22-22.4% band and operating margin is expected at 38.9-39.7%.For the fourth quarter, earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.30-$1.39 per share.Microchip's inventory days in the impending quarter is expected to between 115 and 120 days. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $50-$60 million.For fiscal 2018, capital expenditures are now projected in the range of $200-$210 million, down from $200-$220 million guided previously.  This reflects aggressive investment to strengthen and expand production capabilities.Furthermore, the company plans to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced, which will ultimately improve gross margin.The heightened capital expenditures also reflect three new buildings that Microchip is constructing in Arizona, India and Germany. These, in turn, will help in reducing cost in the long-haul.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter.Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and Consensus  Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and Consensus | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, MCHP has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D.

570,MCHP,"The Semiconductor industry is undergoing a massive consolidation wave. A huge number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worth hundreds of billion dollars have taken place over the last few years.Consolidation is natural in a mature industry like semiconductor which is now more than 60 years old. This industry is currently plagued with two huge challenges, which include escalating costs of producing chips for devices and a sluggish growth rate.With continued innovation over the decades, the size of chips has shrunk to that of a few atoms, while the costs of producing these have flared up. Moreover, escalating costs for designing, packaging and testing are becoming unaffordable for most companies, especially for the smaller firms.Additionally, the industry has been countering a sluggish growth-rate challenge despite  big trends like Internet of Things (IoT) which is believed to add an extraordinary volume in sales of electronic devices. Over the last 15-20 years, the semiconductor industry has recorded growth at an annualized rate of less than 5%.M&A is the RescueIn such a turbulent environment, semiconductor companies need to be huge in order to compete effectively. Therefore, these companies have resorted to M&A in an effort to grab more market share, cut costs, boost productivity and improve investment returns through scale economies.Over the last 24 months, the industry has witnessed more than 10 major mergers and acquisitions which have a combined worth of more than $100 billion, such as the buyout of Altera by Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and purchase of Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) by Avago, which retained the name of the acquired company.The acquisition of Altera has helped Intel get a chip technology which the latter, otherwise, did not have i.e. field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This technology has strengthened its server offerings which enjoy huge demand from data-center operators. Also, FPGAs are very useful in IoT implementation which is a big trend in the technology sector, at the moment.Similarly, the Avago-Broadcom merger has made the current Broadcom the leading diversified communications semiconductor company in the world. This alliance has also resulted in annualized cost synergies of approximately $750 million — a perfect example of enhancing market share and improving economies of scale through M&A activity.Industry Signaling a New Consolidation WaveThe last few months have been eventful for the industry in terms of M&A activities like buyout of Cavium by Marvell Technology and Microchip (MCHP  -  Free Report) taking over Microsemi . The most interesting is Broadcom’s aggressive approach of buying QUALCOMM (QCOM) which, looking at the current scenario, seems to be turning out as a hostile takeover.All the recent M&A events are hinting toward a new wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry in the near future.Grab this Emerging OpportunityM&A announcements generally result in a massive surge of the targeted company’s share prices, thereby providing investors an opportunity to make huge money overnight. As the consolidation cycle for the semiconductor industry does not seem to end any time soon, it is wise to stay focused on stocks that can be a potential takeover target.We, at Zacks, have searched four semiconductor stocks which might get an acquisition offer in few months’ time.The first stock in our list is Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report) which is a specialist in making audio-chips. However, for the past few quarters this company has not been performing well due to its overdependence on a single customer — Apple Inc. — which accounts for more than 75% of its total revenues.Apple’s latest iPhone X sales have remained below expectations, in turn hurting Cirrus Logic’s overall financial performance. Due to this, the company’s shares have plummeted in a year’s time. The stock is currently trading near its 52-week low and has lost 17.8% of its value over the past year. Also, the company is highly undervalued as it trades at a forward P/E multiple of 10.1x, which is a significant discount to the industry average of 14x.We believe there is no such problem in the company’s business model. It is a good takeover target for companies which are specialized in providing hardware to smartphone makers like Qualcomm. Moreover, the cheap valuation makes it an attractive buyout opportunity.Smart Global Holdings Inc. (SGH  -  Free Report), which is a leading provider of DRAM memory to the Brazil market, is another semiconductor company which looks like a potential takeover target. Although the company was founded 25 years back, it got listed in May 2017. The company’s last three quarterly results have been stellar, thanks to elevated demand as well as prices of DRAMs. According to various research reports, the prospects of DRAM memory chip makers will remain bright this year due to supply shortage.Furthermore, although the stock has soared a whopping 182% in the last year, it is still undervalued given the fact that it currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of just 7.6x, significantly lower than the industry average of 14x. Moreover, the company has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 15%, much higher than the industry average of 10.2%.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) may also be another acquisition target as the company is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market. Over the coming years, we expect an increasing number of PCs/servers to use the flash-based solid state technology for storage. The storage market has been witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume, especially the exponential growth in unstructured data.Various research firms suggest NAND (non-volatile storage technology) demand will remain very strong in 2018 as well. This demand will also rise further and might even surpass the manufacturing capacity, leading to periodic shortage and higher pricing in the near term. Marvell has been benefiting from this growing demand for SSD products.Further, although the stock has appreciated 47.9% in a year’s time, it is still undervalued given the fact that it currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of just 17.8x, significantly lower than its industry average of 24.9x. Moreover, the company has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 16.3%, way higher than the industry average of 9.1%.Another potential pick is MaxLinear, Inc. (MXL  -  Free Report), which is a provider of radio-frequency analog and mixed signal semiconductor SoC solutions for broadband communication applications offering small silicon die-size, and low power consumption. The company recorded a 31% increase in its last quarter revenues which indicates that its increased investment toward sales and marketing are paying off. We believe although elevated expenses are hurting its near-term profitability, these will have long-term benefits.The stock currently trades near to its 52-week low and has lost 9.8% of its value over the past year. Also, the company has a forward P/E multiple of 14.2x, which is almost in line with the industry average of 14x.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

575,MCHP,"The U.S. equity markets welcomed 2018 on a strong note as the Dow broke the historic milestone of 25,000 for the first time, while other leading benchmark indices scaled record highs on solid economic data across the globe. The stock market euphoria is likely to extend further on the corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.   As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 15 stocks that qualified the screen:Waste Management, Inc. (WM  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Houston, TX, Waste Management is the largest provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America. The company provides collection, transfer, recycling and resource recovery, as well as disposal services to nearly 20 million residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers. It is also a leading developer, operator and owner of waste-to-energy and landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the United States.

576,MCHP,"Semiconductor stocks have been the subject of unpredictable volatility so far this year, but the underlying business of this industry is growing—and should continue that trend in 2018 and beyond. Throughout the chip-making space, companies have successfully adapted to the changing needs of the consumer, including an increased demand for small, high-powered chips that enable “Internet of Things” (IoT) devices.For those that don’t know, the Internet of Things is the growing world of interconnected household and industrial devices. Everyday products and machines can now be embedded with sensor technology to process data or interact with other electronic devices.For example, consumer-level IoT products include things like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Echo “smart speaker,” wearable motion and activity tracking products, and advanced in-car technology. On the commercial side of the IoT market, industrial manufacturers have begun implementing sensors into machines to track performance and efficiency.(Also Read: How to Invest in the ""Internet of Things"") As demand for the microchips that power these IoT devices continues to grow, semiconductor manufacturers with a focus on IoT products will continue to benefit. And 2018 promises to be another marquee year for these suppliers, with the number of connected devices worldwide set to continue its rapid growth.With that said, we’ve found three already-strong stocks that are looking to benefit even more from further IoT growth in 2018:1. Vishay Intertechnology (VSH  -  Free Report)Vishay Intertechnology is a global manufacturer and supplier of discrete semiconductors. The company has a broad portfolio of unique passive and active solutions that are tailored to the “things” being controlled in the IoT. Vishay markets its portfolio to manufacturers of everything from biometric monitoring systems to fitbands and smart appliances.VSH is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is solid growth option, with earnings and revenue expected to improve by 24.5% and 15.5%, respectively this year. But VSH is also reasonably priced, and the stock’s P/E of 13.7 and PEG of 2.3 show that investors are getting a great bargain on its current outlook. Shares have moved about 14% higher within the past month and could also be an interesting momentum play. 2. Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report)Cypress Semiconductor is a leader provider of high-performance digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Recently, the company shelled out $550 million to acquire Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things business and now its “WICED” Platform is one of the largest IoT portfolios in the industry.Cypress is sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its P/E of 17.3 and PEG of 1.1 are currently trading at noticeable discounts to their respective industry averages. Meanwhile, the company is expected to see a long-term earnings growth rate of more than 16%. Income investors will also note that Cypress offers a 2.5% dividend right now. 3. Cree, Inc. (CREE  -  Free Report)Cree is a manufacturer of semiconductors that enhance the value of solid-state lighting, power and communications products. The company’s “SmartCast” platform enables Power over Ethernet technology and is geared toward IoT products and Smart Building platforms.Cree is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is a hot momentum play, with shares adding more than 10% in the past four weeks to test new 52-week highs. Analysts have also become more bullish on the company’s earnings outlook, with full-year EPS estimates improving nearly 36% in the trailing quarter. Bottom LineThe Internet of Things is one of the most exciting emerging tech markets in the world.  And while these specific products are interesting, the real moneymakers in these situations are the companies that are building the tech that powers these products.The best way for investors to cash in on this growing trend is to identify companies that are not only investing in the Internet of Things, but are also displaying solid fundamentals and impressive Zacks metrics.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

578,MCHP,"Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Aug 3. We note that on average the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, including an impressive beat of 11.11% in the last quarter.Moreover, adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) advanced 65.7% year over year and 10.5% sequentially to $1.16 per share in the quarter. The strong growth was driven by higher net sales, which surged 58.8% from the year-ago quarter to $902.7 million. On a sequential basis, net sales increased almost 2.4%.Meanwhile, the company revised sales and earnings guidance for the going-to-be-reported quarter in early June. The company now forecasts non-GAAP net sales to be in the range of 4.5–6% (mid-point at 5.25%) as compared with earlier guidance range of 2–7% (mid-point at 4.5%), up on a sequential basis.Further, non-GAAP earnings are now expected to be in the range of $1.22–$1.26 per share, as compared with previous guided range of $1.17–$1.27. Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Microchip Technology Incorporated QuoteMicrochip’s stock has gained 24.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 15.6% rally of the industry it belongs to. The outperformance is driven by consistent results as well as the revised guidance that reflects product portfolio strength. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayMicrochip’s microcontroller business (64.3% of fourth-quarter revenues) continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share. Moreover, the company’s microcontroller business is evidently benefiting from the addition of Atmel’s product portfolio (5 cents incremental benefit in the last quarter), which it acquired in Apr 2016.We believe that newly launched products like PIC32MX1/2 XLP and MOST-based Intelligent Network Interface controllers will continue to expand customer base. Moreover, improving operating efficiency and leverage will boost gross margin in the going-to-be reported quarter.Earnings WhispersHowever, our proven model does not conclusively show that Microchip is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Microchip’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.14 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.57% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NetEase (NTES  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.25% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.83% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

579,MCHP,"The Republican-led U.S. Senate managed to pass the tax bill, a big step in the direction of Trump’s promise to dramatically alter U.S. tax law. With corporate taxes likely to come down from 35% to 20%, expectations of higher corporate earnings and dividend payouts are likely to drive stocks.However, stock markets fell on the news with apprehensions over its probable effect on years of monetary policy stimulus and interest rates. As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screen:Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Accenture is one of the world’s leading providers of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services. The company has a modest trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise of 2.6% and long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.3%. Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2.Applied Materials, Inc.

580,MCHP,"A successful investor understands the importance of adding well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Notably, indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. The company’s shares have returned 42.2% year to date, substantially outperforming the 27.3% rally of the industry.Let’s delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the performance.Upbeat Q2 ResultsThe company reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.41 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents. The figure improved 50% year over year and 7.6% sequentially.The upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 15.8% from the year-ago quarter and 4.1% sequentially to $1.01 billion. This marked the first quarter in which the company recorded more than $1 billion in sales.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryMicrochiphas an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 9.3%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 12.2%.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microchip’s current quarter and current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.35 per share, up from earnings of $1.31 per share earlier. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is currently pegged at $5.45 per share compared with $5.29 projected 60 days ago.Other Driving FactorsMicrochip stated that microcontroller revenues (almost 66% of total revenues) have increased more than $500 million in the last five quarters on the back of strong demand. The company’s major product lines — 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit — were up significantly in the last quarter. We believe that Microchip's expanding product portfolio driven by new launches will continue to expand customer base.Moreover, the company is winning market share as reflected by SIA numbers. It had a market share of 15.84% in the third quarter, which expanded 138 basis points from the year-ago quarter.Management noted that design win funnel continues to be and will increase organic growth. Moreover, acquisitions like SMSC, ISSC, Micrel and Atmel have expanded product portfolio, which is positive for top-line growth.Bottom LineLooking at these positives, we believe that Microchip is one technology stock that deserves a place in investors’ portfolio.Microchip is currently trading at a lower price/earnings (P/E) multiple than the industry average. Therefore, we believe that Microchip with its lower forward P/E valuation of 16.3x compared with the industry average of 27.5x may be a great bet.Thus, investing in this stock can yield returns in the short term.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksMicrochip carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) are some other top-ranked stocks in the same sector. All the three companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

582,MCHP,"The word FANG essentially means a large sharp tooth associated with dogs or wolves. No wonder it conjures frightening images of werewolves or Dracula in the general populace, who are steeped in myths and legends. But don’t you worry, this article isn’t meant to spook you with such stories.FANG here represents the most well-liked and high performing tech stocks in the market that have generated impressive returns for the investors. The term was popularized by CNBC's Mad Money host Jim Cramer.The word is an acronym where ""F"" stands for Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), ""A"" stands for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), then there is the ""N,"" which stands for Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), finally the ""G"" which is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), commonly referred to as Google.These four technology powerhouses have performed phenomenally this year. Facebook, Amazon and Netflix have all posted gains of at least 50%, while Alphabet gained more than 30% on a year-to-date basis. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 posted rallies of 28.8% and 17.4%, respectively so far this year.FANG – The RulersFacebook and Alphabet dominate the U.S digital ad market. Per the latest report from eMarketer, both these companies are expected to hold 63.1% share of the total domestic digital ad market, up from the earlier expected number of 60.4% in 2017.Their target advertising capabilities draw advertisers to these platforms, adds eMarketer. A giant user base is another major draw. Facebook has over 2 billion users while its subsidiary, Instagram has over 800 million users.Alphabet's strong advertising revenues and improving paid click growth remain the primary catalysts. Its focus on innovation, AI, cloud, home automation space, strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows. Alphabet has shown good execution to date, more or less maintaining dominant share in a competitive, fast-growing search market.Amazon rules e-commerce and cloud services with its Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) business. The company is benefiting from strong growth across all its businesses and especially the retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. On a global basis, AWS is now accessible across 46 Availability Zones (AZs) through 17 technology infrastructure regions worldwide. These AZs enable businesses to save costs, accelerate innovation, expedite the time to market as well as expand geographic presence within minutes.Netflix is one of the leading video streaming platforms driven by expanding content portfolio and subscriber base. Its growing subscriber base is the primary factor that helps it generate significant revenues. The company remains confident of adding more subscribers as the trend of binge viewing is catching up fast. Netflix now has over 109 million subscribers globally. We believe continuing subscriber addition and expanding content portfolio are the key catalysts that will help Netflix to sustain growth going forward.Despite remarkable growth of the FANG stocks, these aren't the largest standout in the tech sector this year. A small number of companies have posted gains that have crushed the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google this year. Notably, all four of these tech companies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Our ChoicesHere are some notable tech companies that have outperformed the FANG bigwigs, in order of performance.Moreover, these stocks either have a  Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).NVIDIA Corp.

584,MCHP,"The Senate Republicans followed the footsteps of the House of Representatives and managed to pass the tax bill, inching closer to a legislative tax overhaul centered on President Trump’s electoral promise. With corporate taxes likely to come down from 35% to 20%, expectations of higher corporate earnings and dividend payouts are likely to drive stocks. However, the houses need to reconcile to craft a joint bill for it to become a law.While Dow scaled a record high on the news, other markets closed relatively lower on tech sector woes. As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry – the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 13 stocks that qualified the screen:Monsanto Company : Missouri-based Monsanto is a leading global provider of agricultural products.

586,MCHP,"Thanksgiving is coming up and it’s time to stuff dividend stocks with strong growth prospects in your portfolio for market-beating returns. This is especially true as stocks with a history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields.  Inside Dividend Growth StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that pays high yields form a healthy portfolio with more scope for capital appreciation. This is because these stocks act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. Simultaneously, these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Here are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:PetMed Express Inc.
