1,EVRG,"The utility sector is at the crossroads after the release of the new emission standards by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last August. The finalized version of the Clean Power Plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels. An EPA report also indicates that nearly $600 billion will be required to be invested in the water sector over the next two decades to get uninterrupted water and wastewater services of high quality.Evidently, larger utilities with more financial strength and better access to capital are favorably placed to achieve regulatory compliance. This is also likely to trigger more consolidation in the utility landscape, be it the water or the electric utilities. For the latter, the focus is definitely on generating electricity from natural gas and renewable sources. As a result, we expect to see higher solar installations across the U.S. The extension of investment tax credits and production tax credits will further support solar and wind installations in the next few years.The combination of steady electricity price gains and stable-to-improving demand will drive the utility sector. A decline in the unemployment rate, increase in hourly earnings of average workers and higher demand in residential and other customer classes are tailwinds for the utilities.Rising up to the environmental challenge, utility companies are steadily improving their operations by investing in more environment-friendly power generation facilities. A recent release from the U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects renewables used in the electric power sector to increase by 11.3% in 2016 and by 4.4% in 2017.The report also forecast hydropower generation in the electric power sector to increase by 9.1% in 2016 and then decline by 0.6% in 2017. Generation from renewables other than hydropower is forecast to grow by 13.3% in 2016 and by 8.6% in 2017.The report indicates U.S. coal consumption in electric generation will decline by 58 million short tons (MMst) or 8% year over year in 2016. The decline will largely be due to higher demand for clean burning, low-priced natural gas and unseasonably warm temperatures during winter that reduced overall electricity generation.We believe a constructive utility rate environment, increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables and investments in infrastructure upgrade projects will enable the utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base.In the segment below, we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector.Regular Dividend & Share BuybacksUtility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations. The regulated nature of operations provides stability and removes volatility from future earnings. These operators in turn reward their shareholders through the payment of sustainable dividends and share buybacks. This was evident during the economic crisis of 2008–2009 when utilities continued to pay dividends without fail.We have a long list of companies who are sharing profits consistently with their shareholders. Notable among them are companies like CenterPoint Energy (CNP  -  Free Report), Connecticut Water Service Inc.  and Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) who have raised dividend rates annually for more than 10 years now.In Jan 2016, CenterPoint Energy and Duke Energy increased their quarterly dividend rates by 4% and 3.8% to 25.75 cents and 82.5 cents, respectively, while in Jan 2016, Connecticut Water Service raised its payout by 5.6% to 28.25 cents.Stable & Growing DemandThe biggest positive as well as the most fundamental strength of the utility sector is that there is basically no viable substitute for their services. The endless need for electricity and utility services is a prime driver. This gives revenues and cash flows a high level of certainty and visibility.Due to the planned reduction in coal-powered units, the EIA forecasts total U.S. electricity generation in 2016 to average 11.2 terawatt hours per day, marginally below 2015 generation. The EIA expects total electricity generation to grow by 1.6% in 2017.Focused on R&D & Extension of ITC/PTC In their pursuit of improving the standard of services, utility operators have steadily invested in research and development (R&D). They have brought new smart meters, and transmission and distribution lines, into operation without compromising on energy efficiency.Utility operators are also benefiting from ongoing research in the solar photovoltaic (PV) sector. Solar energy is a growing alternate energy source and the new solar cells with higher conversion rates allow operators to generate more power from fewer solar panels. This enables the operators to lower the cost of generating power from alternate sources as these are generally more expensive than fossil fuel sources.In addition, the utility friendly move of the U.S. administration through the extension of the validity period of Solar Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Wind Energy Production Tax Credit (PTC) will help the utilities. We will see more utility scale solar and wind projects coming up, which will boost green power generation.Mergers and AcquisitionsUtility sector operators don’t shy away from M&A activities to supplement their organic growth. In addition to giving their operations greater scale and scope, such measures also lead to cost synergies and better utilization of resources. The larger the companies, the more access they have to funds essential for vital infrastructure upgrades.We believe that in a mature energy market like the U.S., mergers and acquisitions represent a sure way of enhancing market share. This expands market reach through the usage of transmission and distribution lines, diversifies the generation portfolio and also lowers operating costs through the usage of common back office space.In Mar 2016, Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) completed the much-awaited acquisition of Pepco Holdings and has plans to invest $23 billion in regulated assets during the 2016–2018 time frame, which will help in earnings growth of 7% to 9%.In May 2016, Great Plains Energy Inc.  announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Westar Energy Inc. WR.The transaction has an estimated value of $12.2 billion, including $3.6 billion of Westar Energy.On Feb 1, 2016, Dominion Resources Inc. (D  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Questar Corp. STR. Dominion will require to shell out nearly $4.4 billion and assume Questar's outstanding debt. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2016 subject to regulatory approvals.We are also likely to see major acquisition activities in the water utility space. During the first quarter of 2016, American Water Works Company (AWK  -  Free Report) closed seven acquisitions adding 6,868 customers to its existing customer base. The seven pending acquisitions will add another 33,752 customers. Another player in the water utility space, Aqua America Inc. (WTR  -  Free Report) has also completed several acquisitions in its service territories, adding 5,250 customers (as of May 3, 2016) to its existing customer base.To Sum UpWe can have different fuel types like coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power and renewable sources to produce electricity, but we do not have any alternative to electricity. Similarly, clean water and wastewater services do not have any viable substitute. This is perhaps the most vital driving factor for the industry.Stable operations, highly visible revenues and cash flows, combined with the sector’s income/yield attributes are some of its key defining features.Without a doubt, the increase in interest rates in Dec 2015 has raised the borrowing costs for the utilities. With all eyes set to the next move of the Fed, it appears that the Fed chair has abandoned all plans of a rate hike in June citing weakness in international markets and lower-than-excepted job additions in May. Though Fed officials are seriously considering a hike in July or September, low interest rates for now will definitely benefit the utilities.Volatility in the markets has also driven investors to seek protection in the utility space. These regular dividend payers are often regarded as a “bond substitute“ and consistent performing utilities continue to be a safe investment option for jittery investors.
"
2,EVRG,"Stocks of utility sector companies are among the safest investment bets in the market, but they are not without issues. A growing regulatory burden and increased debt loads remain a concern. But an even bigger issue is the interest rate backdrop, particularly with the Federal Reserve getting ready to start tightening monetary policy in the not-too-distant future.
"
3,EVRG,"As high-yielding equity investments, utility stocks remain exposed to rising interest rates, as do fixed income investments. Higher interest rates mean increased cost of capital, a basic need of these operators given their ongoing need for investments. Just as their low-risk and high-yielding attributes make them a preferred choice during an economic down-cycle, a bullish economic environment makes utilities look a little wan and lusterless.
"
4,EVRG,"Below, we point out some factors which investors should take into consideration before investing their money in this space.New Regulation on the Horizon
"
5,EVRG,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a new plan to curb carbon pollution from domestic power plants. The objective is to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 from 2005 levels. If the plan goes into effect, electric utilities relying primarily on coal and without adequate retrofit to scale down the carbon footprint will be the worst affected.
"
6,EVRG,"The DTE Energy Co. (DTE  -  Free Report) management believes that nearly $15 billion needs to be invested in the state of Michigan to upgrade energy infrastructure to match the required environmental standards prescribed by the EPA. The company will have to invest in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion to meet the standards of the energy policy.
"
7,EVRG,"So, going by the above example, upgrading all the old coal-fired power plants across the country to meet environmental compliance will need huge capital outlay and put immense stress on the finances of these utilities.Debt Levels
"
8,EVRG,"Utilities are capital intensive and need to have a continuous inflow of funds to carry on their organic growth and infrastructure upgrade projects. This is essential in maintaining the uninterrupted supply of basic amenities like electricity, fresh water and gas. Utilities generate funds from operations which are to some extent used to meet their capital requirements. But these funds are mostly used for dividend payouts. They take recourse to external sources of financing to meet their capital requirements.
"
9,EVRG,"The Federal Reserve in its recent meeting did not alter the interest rates. However, market experts believe that the Fed might increase the borrowing costs sooner than later given the current pace of U.S. economic recovery.
"
10,EVRG,"Higher interest rates and an increase in the debt level -- for that matter a steep debt/equity ratio -- impact the credit ratings of these utility operators. If the credit ratings go down, a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates, leading to a rise in cost of operations.
"
11,EVRG,"We believe a rising interest rate environment could add to the troubles of the utility operators, as raising funds from the market becomes costlier. So, while investing in a utility, one must take a note of its outstanding debts.Buyers’ Market
"
12,EVRG,"The utility service markets are gradually transforming into buyers’ markets. Many states allow consumers to migrate from one utility operator to another. Consumers thus have the option of choosing the best and/or the cheapest operator in the region. Higher-cost producers are gradually pushed out of the market unless they can scale down their costs.
"
13,EVRG,"Long-term power purchase agreements between operators and customers could also impact profitability. In situations when there is an increase in the cost of generation, the operators still have to abide by the pre-existing agreement and sell power at pre-determined rates, thereby stretching margins.Competition with Bonds
"
14,EVRG,"Additionally, these reliable dividend payers are in competition with bonds as an investment option. The looming threat of an increase in interest rates from the present level will definitely make bonds more attractive than utilities.Bottom Line
"
15,EVRG,"Despite the drawbacks of the utility industry, it is still undoubtedly one of the most stable industries to invest in. Undoubtedly the focus on clean energy is going to be the top most agenda in the coming years. We expect the utilities to take advantage of the shale boom in the U.S. and develop more power plants based on natural gas, which in a way will lower emission.
"
16,EVRG,"We recommend investors to stay away from Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWN  -  Free Report), MDU Resources Group Inc. (MDU  -  Free Report) and Westar Energy, Inc. (WR) as these stocks currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). These companies registered average negative earnings surprises of 15.79%, 13.42%, and 9.97%, respectively, over the last four quarters.

18,EVRG,"The successful stock-for-stock merger between Westar Energy Inc and Great Plains Energy Incorporated has formed Evergy Inc. (EVRG  -  Free Report), with equity value of $15 billion. The new entity commenced trade in the exchange from Jun 5, 2018, and became a member of the elite S&P 500 group on the same day by replacing Navient Corporation (NAVI  -  Free Report).Evergy will serve more than 1.6 million utility customers in Kansas and Missouri. Nearly 50% of the electricity supplied to its customers will come from clean sources. The company will operate through its subsidiaries — Westar Energy and Kansas City Power and Light Company.Benefits of Merger to CustomersCustomers of Westar Energy and Great Plains Energy will enjoy the benefits of customer bill credits over the first five years, post the closure of the merger. Customers in Missouri will receive $29-million bill credit and in Kansas, they will get bill credit worth $75 million.Benefits for ShareholdersEvergy is planning a 60-million share repurchase of its common stock for the next two years, which is likely to stabilize the capital structure. Shareholders will benefit from solid returns and attractive dividend growth.Focus on RenewablesThe new utility will focus on renewable energy sources to meet household and businesses requirements. The company, which will be among the largest wind power operators in the United States, plans to add more renewable sources in its generation fleet in the long run.Zacks RankEvergy carries a Zacks Rank #3(Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks  #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Acquisition & Merger in Utility SpaceIn a bid to increase scope of operation and utilize resources, Utility players are resorting to mergers and acquisitions. Larger companies are frequently resorting to this trend, courtesy of funds that are essential for vital infrastructure upgrades.In early 2018, SCANA Corporation (SCG  -  Free Report) entered into a merger agreement with Dominion Energy (D  -  Free Report). Per the deal, stockholders of SCANA will get 0.669 shares of Dominion. Considering the assumption of $6.7-billion debt of SCANA by Dominion, the transaction is worth about $14.6 billion.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

19,EVRG,"The global market is far from being stable, thanks to possibilities of a Fed rate hike, uncertainties surrounding the Presidential Election in the U.S., the volatility in oil prices and sluggish growth in China. To counter the overall uncertainty, an investor should opt for defensive plays like utilities that known for their stability even amid global turmoil.The utility sector is at a crucial juncture after the release of new emission standards by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last August. The finalized version of the Clean Power Plan calls for CO2 reduction of 28% by 2025 and 32% by 2030, from 2005 levels.

A recent release from the U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects other renewables used in the electric power sector to increase from 2.6 quadrillion Btu per year in 2015 to 8.8 quadrillion Btu per year in 2040, reflecting growth of 5%.The report also forecasts hydropower generation in the electric power sector to increase from 2.3 quadrillion Btu per year in 2015 to 2.8 quadrillion Btu per year in 2040, reflecting growth of 0.8%.Moreover, the report indicates U.S. coal based generation to drop from 17.2 quadrillion Btu per year in 2015 to 13.1 quadrillion Btu per year in 2040, reflecting a decline of 1.1%.We believe a constructive utility rate environment, increase in electricity production from natural gas and renewables and investments in infrastructure upgrade projects will enable the utilities to efficiently serve a larger customer base.In the segment below, we discuss the basic strengths of the utility sector.Regular Dividend & Share BuybacksUtility operators generate more or less stable earnings unless there are severe factors disrupting their operations.
