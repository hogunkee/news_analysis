0,PNW,"Coca-Cola (KO) is hoping its third breakout since July will prove to be the winner. The stock broke out of a 15-month base in July and then essentially moved sideways.  A flat pattern followed, and again gains were puny. On Tuesday, Coca-Cola broke out of a shallow pattern. The stock rose 0.71 to 47.43, scoring a new high and clearing…

2,PNW,"Pinnacle West Capital (PNW) had its Relative Strength (RS) Rating upgraded from 70 to 73 Friday -- a welcome improvement, but still short of the 80 or better score you look for. X IBD's proprietary RS Rating tracks technical performance by showing how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks compares to that of the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research reveals that the best stocks often have an RS Rating of over 80 as they begin their biggest price moves. See if Pinnacle West Capital can continue to rebound and hit that benchmark. Pinnacle West Capital broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 89.66 entry from a flat base. In the scenario where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new pattern to take shape. Also keep in mind that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. Earnings growth dropped last quarter from 425% to 38%, but sales rose from 0% to 3%. Pinnacle West Capital holds the No. 8 rank among its peers in the Utility-Electric Power industry group. Edenor (EDN), Pampa Energia (PAM) and PNM Resources (PNM) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:IBD Stock Rating Upgrades: Rising Relative StrengthWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

6,PNW,"The stock market today showed resilience following big gains on Tuesday and Wednesday as the major indexes gave little back in early-afternoon trading Wednesday. Meanwhile, utility stocks rebounded fiercely, a good sign that U.S. interest rates aren't likely to rise swiftly amid the dull economic recovery.However, a few leading utility names, including Pinnacle West Capital (PNW), Duke Energy (DUK) and Consolidated Edison (ED), are showing some deep fissures in their latest rallies. Further sell-offs could raise the odds that some of these stocks threaten to do a round-trip of their year-to-date gains.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were roughly break-even, while the Dow Jones industrial average, a price-weighted index, eased 0.1%. Volume was running uniformly lower on both exchanges vs. the same time on Wednesday.The Dow utility average, which got smacked with a 0.4% decline on Wednesday as the Nasdaq and the 500 posted solid gains, rallied 0.9%. Yet the defensive index is still down more than 2% in the second quarter so far.While numerous top-rated electric and gas utilities tracked by IBD's Income Investor feature have shown mild pullbacks, others have undercut their 50-day moving averages and are failing to rebound quickly. Stocks that show healthy action tend to ride on the north side of this support line, not the south side.Pinnacle West Capital rallied more than 1% to 72.74, but volume was running more than 30% below its 50-day average. The stock, nevertheless, has done a good job of recouping much of its more than 5% losses during a May 17-18 sell-off. That decline sent the Phoenix-based power producer sharply below its 50-day line near 73; the 50-day line has been rising sharply since late January.On Feb. 1, Pinnacle West raced past a 67.12 flat-base buy point in heavy trading. That breakout ignited what has become a 13% gain in just two months -- a remarkable rally for a utility stock. Pinnacle boasts a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 3 on a scale of zero (steady) to 99 (wild) from IBD.Duke Energy rallied 1% to 77.79, still below its 50-day moving average. The Charlotte, N.C., firm inked its second deal in 2016 to convert methane gas captured from swine waste into electricity. Consolidated Edison of New York gained 1% to 72.62 in very slow turnover. Trade has been choppy ever since the stock first undercut its 50-day line in heavy trading on April 20.Notice how on April 21, Edison tumbled another 3% as volume ballooned 90% higher than its 50-day average of 2 million shares. Elsewhere, online streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) continued to rebound, rising more than 2% to 102.60 in volume running more than 50% above its usual pace. Watch to see if the former huge market winner can cross back above the key 200-day moving average. Such action would be bullish for the large-cap name, which currently has a $44 billion market cap and 428 million shares outstanding.Netflix's revenue climbed 21%, 26% and 23% vs. year-ago levels from 2013 to 2015. IBD Stock Checkup shows that Netflix's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+ now indicates net accumulation of shares by mutual funds, banks, insurers and the like. Netflix was highlighted by IBD earlier this week after showing more signs it could finish a new base pattern.

This means that in Europe, Mexico and Brazil, phones will have the PayPal-powered mobile wallet already installed in them. Through these partnerships, PayPal can offer merchants and consumers more flexibility and choices in how they want to pay and get paid.

It's up nearly 3% this year, while the S&P 500 is off more than 9%. Furthermore, the company's annual dividend of $2.17 a share yields 4.4%, nearly double the S&P 500 average of 2.3%.The Atlanta-based company reported Feb. 3 that Q4 profit rose 16% to 44 cents a share, accelerating for the third straight quarter and beating Wall Street estimates. However, revenue dipped 10% to $3.6 billion as warmer weather reduced demand.Pinnacle West Capital (PNW) provides electricity to 1.2 million customers in Arizona. It's up almost 5% this year as it hovers below a 70.10 saucer-with-handle buy point. Its annualized dividend of $2.50 a share yields 3.6%.The Phoenix-based company will report Q4 results Feb. 19. Profit is expected to soar 420% to 26 cents a share, rebounding from a 77% drop in the same period a year ago. Revenue is seen rising 5% to $763 million.

The Ohio-based electricity producer, which serves over 5 million customers in 11 states, is nearly 4% below a 63.73 buy point.

14,PNW,"The AES Corporation (AES  -  Free Report) is set to release fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 27.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 17.24%. Moreover, it failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average earnings miss being 3.99%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOn Oct 2, 2017, AES Corp. transferred 100% of its shares in Shulbinsk HPP and Ust-Kamenogorsk HPP to the Republic of Kazakhstan in accordance with the termination of the concession agreement. As a result, the company anticipates a loss on disposal of at least $37 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.In December 2017, AES Corp. had hiked its quarterly common stock dividend by 3%. This indicates improved cash inflow from operating activities which we believe will duly get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 32 cents per share projects a decline of 8.6%, while the same for revenues of $3.67 billion shows a rise of 3.6% on a year-over-year basis.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for AES Corp. this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, AES Corp lacks these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +8.25%.

15,PNW,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Pinnacle West Capital is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PNW in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 12 cents per share for PNW, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PNW, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +12.20% heading into earnings season.Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle West Capital Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that PNW has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

Our model conclusively shows that Pinnacle West is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses both components.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is +12.20%.

17,PNW,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.31%. Moreover, Entergy Corp. outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 85.43%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayMost of the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal winters during the quarter under review. This has lowered demand for electricity in these regions, which in turn, is expected to weigh on the company’s fourth-quarter sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Entergy Corp.’s fourth-quarter sales of $2.33 billion marks a year-over-year decline of 12.2%.In October 2017, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the recovery of nuclear dry fuel storage costs incurred by Entergy Corp. earlier. The move is expected to boost the company’s fourth-quarter earnings. Our consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share reflects an annual growth of 35.5%.Moreover, during the fourth quarter, Entergy Corp. raised its quarterly dividend by 2.3% to 89 cents per share. This indicates improved cash inflow from operating activities for the company which we believe will drive its fourth-quarter results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Entergy Corp. is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

18,PNW,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 23, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the utility’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.38%. However, Public Service Enterprise outperformed the same in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Public Service Enterprise is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Public Service Enterprise has both these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.92%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Public Service Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayIn June 2017, Public Service Enterprise submitted the planned update to its Energy Strong cost recovery petition, to include Energy Strong investments in service as of May 31, 2017. This filing requested estimated annual increases in electric and gas revenues of $16 million and $2 million, respectively. Last August, the BPU approved these raised rates effective Sep 1, 2017.Moreover, in June 2017, the company made its annual Basic Gas Supply Services (BGSS) filing with the Board of Public Utility (BPU) requesting an increase in the BGSS rate from approximately 34 cents to 37 cents per therm, effective Oct 1, 2017. Therefore, we may expect these to duly get reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter results in the form of improved sales as well as earnings growth.In line with this, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 56 cents per share reflects year-over-year growth of 3.7%. Meanwhile, the same for revenues is pegged at $2.36 billion, depicting an increase of 12.8%.On the flip side, the unemployment rate in Public Service Enterprise’s service territories is worse than the national average. A deteriorating economy is likely to lower the utility demand in the state, which in turn may weigh on the company’s quarterly performance.Nevertheless, earlier-than-expected snowfall in December 2017 in New Jersey drove demand for electricity substantially in the city.

19,PNW,"Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Feb 22. In the third quarter, the utility company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 14.77%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderAlliant Energy’s earnings are expected to gain from its robust capital expenditure plans and constructive regulatory decisions.

The new rate of electricity, which became effective from 2017, has helped the company increase earnings.Earnings WhisperOur proven model shows that Alliant Energy is unlikely to beat estimates because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients.

20,PNW,"CenterPoint Energy Corp (CNP  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 22.Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.88%. However, CenterPoint Energy outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.42%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCenterPoint Energy witnessed increased customer count during third-quarter 2017, primarily driven by the acquisition of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM). The AEM acquisition has been accretive to the company’s results as of Sep 30, 2017, which in turn bolstered its Energy Services segment’s growth. We expect the company’s fourth-quarter results to also benefit from the same.Per management, customer growth, rate relief, energy services and midstream segments are likely to drive CenterPoint Energy’s fourth-quarter performance.Major regions of CenterPoint Energy’s service territory witnessed warmer-than-normal winter during the fourth quarter. This led to lower expenditure for consumers which are likely to dent the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents for fourth-quarter earnings marks a 15.4% increase year over year, while revenue estimate of $2.15 billion hints at an improvement of almost 3.4%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that CenterPoint Energy is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CenterPoint Energy has an Earnings ESP of -7.29%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CenterPoint Energy carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

It has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 9.08%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Edison International is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

This in turn is likely to have an adverse impact on the fourth-quarter results.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edison International’s fourth-quarter earnings reflects 7.9% decline year over year, on 0.2% lower revenues worth $2.88 billion.On a bright note, the company hiked quarterly dividend rate by 11.5%, for shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec 29, 2017. This represents the strong cash generation capacity that Edison International boasts. We anticipate its soon-to-be-reported quarter’s result to duly reflect the company’s efficiency in terms of reporting a stable cash inflow through operating activities.Edison International Price and EPS Surprise Edison International Price and EPS Surprise | Edison International QuoteOther Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other utility stocks which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter results on Feb 23.

29,PNW,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report), primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution of power, is scheduled to report its financial results on Oct 24, before the market opens.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Entergy is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +3.94%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $2.25, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $2.16. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Entergy carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Now, the factors influencing Entergy's quarterly results are elaborated below.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayDuring the second-quarter earnings call, Entergy had said that there were non-recurring items in 2016 that will lead to a decline of 5 cents in its third-quarter earnings.The company also expects to continue witnessing higher nuclear spending that will increase staffing levels to be consistent with industry norms and execute on projects resultantly improving the reliability. This, in turn, is expected to decrease earnings about 20 cents in the second half of the year, about two thirds of which will be in the third quarter.Apart from this, other non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses are expected to deteriorate third-quarter earnings by 10 cents. Overall, the performance in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to be poor compared with the year-ago quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be reported quarter’s earnings moved down 6.5%.On the brighter note, this New Orleans, LA-based company’s service territories witnessed above-average temperatures during the quarter. This should in fact lead to increased electric sales in these regions, which in turn, is expected to boost the top line. May be that’s why our Consensus Estimate called for revenues of $3.13 billion in the third quarter, implying a year-over-year increase of 0.1%, for Entergy.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other operators in the electric utility space worth considering, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc. (NI  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter results on Nov 1. The company has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #2.

34,PNW,"First Solar Inc. (FSLR  -  Free Report) announced that it is partnering with Arizona Public Service (“APS”), subsidiary of Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW  -  Free Report), to develop a 50-megawatt (MW) solar-fueled battery project in Arizona. First Solar will also build and operate a 65-MW solar field to charge the battery.Arizona Public Service has signed a 15-year power-purchase agreement with First Solar. This agreement will enable APS to supply energy stored in the battery. The battery will store power when the sun is high and help APS to deliver it to customers between 3 and 8 p.m. when the sun is on its way down, but energy use is peaking.Rising Renewable Usage Per a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, renewable sources accounted for nearly 50% of the 25 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale electric generating capacity to have been added to the power grid during 2017.EIA expects solar projects in the United States to grow by 127 GW and utility-scale storage capacity to improve by 34 GW within 2020 to 2050 time period.The rising renewable projects will pave the way for battery projects, as it helps to stabilize and store the excess power produced from the projects to be used, when demand peaks.Battery Storage in the United StatesBattery Storage projects are gradually being installed across the United States.  Per the EIA release, more than 700 megawatt (MW) of battery storage projects were installed in the United States.The projects not only help in the storage of renewable power but also improve the grid reliability and efficiency. We expect more battery projects to come up, as it helps to neutralize the variability of electricity generation from the utility-scale solar projects. A decline in the cost of storage projects will also promote growth in battery storage projects.Southern California Edison, a subsidiary of Edison International (EIX  -  Free Report), is also involved in various projects that promote the usage of battery storage systems.Price MovementIn the last six months, First Solar has returned 27.9% compared with industry’s rally of 3.4%.  Zacks RankFirst Solar carries a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy). Another top-ranked stock in the same industry, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is Sunrun Inc. (SUN  -  Free Report).

Its 2017 and 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up 48.4% and 50%, respectively, over the last 60 days.Our ViewThe primary drawback of the solar projects is their inability to produce electricity when the sun is down. However, the ongoing improvement in advanced battery technology will address this issue by storing power and help utilities serve customers with clean electricity, even when the sun is down.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

35,PNW,"Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd) has received necessary approval from The Illinois Commerce Commission (“ICC”) to pass on the tax savings resulting from the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).The new act became effective Jan 1, 2018 and has lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This led to reduction in the amount of federal income tax ComEd will pay to the government. ComEd sought approval from ICC to pass its tax savings of nearly $200 million to its residential customers in Illinois which will result in average savings of $2-$3 per month from February. Without ICC’s approval customers would not realize savings from the tax cut until 2020.Tax Cuts – A Boon for UtilitiesUtilities in some states are trying to use the tax cut to lower the bill of their customers.  Utilities are passing on the benefits to their customer base either through reduction in existing electric rates or by adjusting the planned rate increases.Passing on tax savings does not look significant when we consider a single user or a single utility, however, it is significant when we consider the nation as a whole. Already decisions have been taken to pass on more than billions of dollars in tax savings to customers and we expect this amount to increase.Utilities like AVANGRID, Inc. (AGR  -  Free Report) and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) among others, have also expressed intention to pass on the tax savings benefits to customers. NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), on the other hand, has decided to use the tax savings of nearly $1.3 billion to recoup the storm recovery expenses, without increasing the bills of its users in Florida.Quality Service at Low PricesThe savings due to tax cuts will allow the residential customers of ComEd to enjoy safe and reliable services at a very competitive price.Since 2001, ComEd has invested in excess of $5 billion to strengthen its electrical transmission and distributions system and has also nearly completed the installation of nearly 4 million smart meters. ComEd rates are low compared with the average electric rates in 10 largest American cities.Thanks to the tax cuts, the user will enjoy the benefits from strengthening infrastructure of its service provider, at lower rates.Price MovementExelon’s shares have returned 7.9% last year, outperforming the rally of 2.3% from the industry it belongs to. Zacks Rank Exelon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

36,PNW,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation’s (PNW  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, Arizona Public Service Company (“APS”), announced that the company has requested the Arizona Corporation Commission to approve a $119 million bill reduction for customers.Notably, this request for reduction in customer bills is a result of federal corporate tax cuts, to be effective Feb 1, 2018. Further the subsidiary anticipates additional tax cut savings to be available at a later date once the full impact of the new law has been realized.What Led to the Request?The unit’s decision to request for bill reduction is a result of the company anticipation of federal tax savings in future. As such federal tax savings can be attributed to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, a law that was passed on Dec 22, 2017. The law came into effect on Jan 1, 2018. A cut in federal income tax means that the company will be able to realize considerable tax savings.The company’s decision to share tax reduction benefit will allow customers to enjoy reliable services at a reduced price. Apart from Pinnacle West Capital other utilities like AVANGRID, Inc. (AGR  -  Free Report) and WGL Holdings, Inc. , have shown their intention to pass on the tax savings benefits to their customers.Outcome ExpectedIf the rate request is approved, it will result in a decrease of $119 million in customers’ bill. This is expected to offset the $95 million revenue increase witnessed in APS’s last rate review.Once approved, an amount equal to $0.004258/kWh will be passed directly to customers through a new adjustor mechanism called the Tax Expense Adjustor Mechanism (“TEAM”). However, the amount of savings per customer will vary as per actual energy usage and each of the customers would receive the credit on their monthly bill.How Will APS Gain?Pinnacle West derives majority of revenues from its APS unit. Notably, the company’s APS unit has benefited greatly from increase in retail customers by 1.4% in 2016. Further, it expects annual customers’ to grow in the range of 2-3% over the 2017-2019 time period.Further, the company's steady emphasis in the diversification and expansion of asset base and other modernization initiatives are expected to bolster performance going ahead. Pinnacle West Capitalprojects capital expenditure of $1,181 million and $1,009 million in 2018 and 2019 respectively.

Also, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 2.98%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Ameren is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +4.35%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 72 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 69 cents. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Ameren currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Ameren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ameren Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayFor 2017, Ameren plans to invest $2.2 billion, including $785 million for Ameren Missouri, $480 million for Ameren Illinois Electric distribution, $255 million for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, $375 million for Ameren Illinois Transmission, and $325 million for Ameren Transmission company of Illinois. Hence, we expect the second-quarter’s results to reflect a fraction of this investment.Additionally, the unemployment rate in Ameren’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is also likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Moreover, the company’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the to-be-reported quarter. This, in turn, will result in higher household expenditures on cooling, which is expected to drive revenues.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few operators in the electric utility space that you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P.

46,PNW,"Sempra Energy (SRE  -  Free Report) will report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Aug 4.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 9.43%. Moreover, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 0.16%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Sempra Energy is likely to beat estimates this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates, and Huntington Ingalls has the right mix.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is +11.25%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 89 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Sempra Energy holds a Zacks Rank #2, which, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Sempra Energy Price and EPS Surprise Sempra Energy Price and EPS Surprise | Sempra Energy QuoteFactors at PlayAt the onset of the second quarter, Sempra Energy issued its long-term outlook, wherein apart from reiterating its 2017 EPS guidance, the company announced plans to invest $14.2 billion over the next five years. The announcement also included a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for EPS in the range of 10–11% and completion of 100 megawatts renewable projects, over the same period. Although the overall impact of these plans will be realized over the long term, the company most likely has started taking initiatives toward achieving them, which is expected to get reflected in the upcoming second-quarter results as well.During its first-quarter earnings call, Sempra Energy announced that its IEnova unit projects will complete three natural gas pipelines, worth $900 million by the end of the second quarter. Further updates on this project can be expected once Sempra Energy releases its second-quarter results. If completed, it will successfully boost the company’s growth.On the flip side, the Aliso Canyon gas leak event caused the company to incur estimated cost of $799 million in the first quarter, higher than the prior-quarter figure. Although, the company has resolved a number of key issues related to this event, there still remain a few that might continue to weigh down on the second-quarter results.Moreover, Sempra Energy faces foreign exchange exposure in Mexcio and South America, wherein it does not hedge the additional costs. These may hurt the company’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 80 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.77%. Meanwhile, the estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.52 billion, displaying a 16.75% upside.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few other Utility stocks worth considering on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat.Ameren Corp.

47,PNW,"The Q2 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark. As of Jul 28, 286 S&P 500 members came up with quarterly earnings. Total earnings are up 11.3% from the same period last year on 6.1% higher revenues. 74.5% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 69.2% topped revenue estimates.Nearly 1000 companies – including 130 S&P 500 members – are expected to come up with results this week. Combining the results of the reported index members (286 members till Jul 28) with the remaining 214 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 9.2% on 5.0% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the Utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Initially, when the season started, we expected earnings to drop 2.9%. However, as the season gradually unfolds, we expect utility earnings to drop 1.8%.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Four out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

48,PNW,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial results before the market opens on Aug 3.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 2.78%. However, CenterPoint underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 2.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCenterPoint witnessed increased customer count and throughput during first-quarter 2017, primarily due to acquisitions of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM) and the Energy Services business. Going ahead, similar solid performance from Energy Services is expected in second quarter and beyond, buoyed by increased operating income. Also, the AEM acquisition is likely to be modestly accretive this year, even after accounting for integration expenses. We expect to receive further updates on these once the company releases its second-quarter results.The company's service territories witnessed more or less warmer-than-normal temperatures during the second quarter. This will result in higher household expenditure on cooling, which might boost its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.However, in the second quarter, a handful of tornados and thunderstorms hit Texas. With the state being the primary service region for CenterPoint, it exposed the company’s utility plants to damage and consequent expenditures. Any damage to these plants by these storms might weigh down on the company’s profitability in the second quarter.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings projects an improvement of 15.6%, while the consensus for revenues hints at an improvement of almost 13.75% on a year-over-year basis.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CenterPoint is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CenterPoint has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 20 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CenterPoint carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CenterPoint Energy, Inc.

50,PNW,"Duke Energy Corp. (DUK  -  Free Report), an electric and natural gas utility based in Charlotte, NC, is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company saw a negative earnings surprise of 1.89%. However, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.94%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayBeing a premier utility service provider, Duke Energy continues to invest in electric and gas infrastructure, along with retail and wholesale customer growth. Management believes that in 2017 the company will perform favorably in the electric business driven by base rate increases in Duke Energy Progress South Carolina and the generation base rate adjustment mechanism in Florida.Meanwhile, Duke Energy maintains its commitment to reduce its operations and maintenance costs. Hence, we expect the company’s second-quarter results to reflect these scores.On the flip side, the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the quarter. This will result in lower household expenditure on heating and, in turn, might adversely impact revenues for the energy provider.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decrease of 5.14% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is $5.54 billion, implying 1.05% year-over-year growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Duke Energy this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Duke Energy has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.01.

Also, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 3.97%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayConsolidated Edison continues to follow a systematic capital investment plan for infrastructure development and the expansion of renewable assets. To this end, the company plans to invest $450 million in renewable electric production projects in 2017. Hence, we expect the upcoming second-quarter’s results to reflect a fraction of this investment.However, the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the quarter. This will result in lower household expenditure on heating and, in turn, might adversely impact revenues for this energy provider.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 21.30% year over year, whereas sales are anticipated to drop 0.01% to $2.79 billion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Consolidated Edison this quarter.

52,PNW,"We expect Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 3. Last quarter, this independent utility company reported a positive earnings surprise of 40.00%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?    Our proven model shows that Pinnacle West Capital is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates and Pinnacle West Capital has the right mix.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.21 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.16 per share resulting in an Earnings ESP of +4.31%. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pinnacle West Capital carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Pinnacle West Capital’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderPinnacle West has experienced a modest expansion rate in retail customer growth and is targeting growth rate in the range of 1.5–2.5% in 2017. This is likely to have a positive impact the second quarter as well. This effect is likely to be witnessed in the quarter with improvement in Arizona’s economy and ongoing improvement in U.S. economic conditions.Growth in employment continues to have a positive effect on the Metro Phoenix area's commercial and residential real estate markets. This above-average job growth is likely to reflect positively in the results by increasing demand for utility services.The results of the company are also likely to improve since the first quarter backed by normalized weather conditions that are likely to lead to more customer conservation steps, energy efficiency programs and other distributed renewable generation initiatives throughout its service territory.Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise   Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle West Capital Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderPinnacle West Capital is not the only company in the industry looking up this earnings season.

53,PNW,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 2, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 6.60%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Entergy is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +0.83%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.21, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged slightly lower at $1.20. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Entergy currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayDuring the first-quarter earnings call, Entergy had said that it expects continued growth in industrial sales in 2017 driven by new and expansion projects. Consequently, it is expected that industrial sales will witness growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Again, the company's service territories witnessed above-average temperatures during the quarter. This should in fact lead to increased electric sales in these regions, which in turn, is expected to boost the top line.On the flip side, Entergy had earlier said that in the first half of 2017 sales at the existing petroleum refiners are projected to decline year over year due to anticipated customer outages. This, in turn, will negatively impact the company’s second-quarter results.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 61.3%, on revenues of $2.44 billion, implying a year-over-year decrease of 0.8%.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other operators in the electric utility space worth considering, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NiSource, Inc.

54,PNW,"The third-quarter earnings season has crossed the half way mark. Total earnings for the 327 S&P members that have already released results are up 7.8% year over year on 6.5% higher revenues, with 74.9% beating earnings and 65.7% topping revenue estimates.Combining the results of the 372 S&P 500 members with the index’s members yet to report, we expect total third-quarter earnings to be up 5.6% year over year on 5.5% higher revenues.Amid this backdrop, let us focus on Zacks Utilities sector this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space were expected to drop 3.8% on 1.1% lower revenues as of November 1. Notably, 10 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline. Read more details in the weekly Earnings Outlook.Notably, capital intensive utilities were impacted by increased interest rates in March and June, this year. In addition, the utilities operating in Texas and Florida were severely hurt by the hurricanes (Harvey and Irma).With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, consequently making them a more attractive option for investors.Therefore, to maintain their performance level, these utilities are resorting to cost savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing more on renewable energy to generate electricity with lower emission.  Let us take a sneak peek at the four utility stocks scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3.Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 0.98% in the previous quarter.Last month, Hurricane Irma led to catastrophic losses in Florida. As a result, Duke Energy’s electrical system suffered significant damages in Hardee and Highlands County. The company took several initiatives to address these issues and initiated repair work, which included rebuilding this system. These must have increased the third-quarter expenses of Duke Energy, which we believe might weigh down on its bottom-line.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 7.8% year over year. The same for sales are anticipated to drop 1.1% to $6.75 billion.According to our proven model, stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our proven model does not show that Duke Energy is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.78% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.55, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56. Moreover, it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Again, owing to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois, the bottom line will decrease by approximately 23 cents per share.In this regard, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s third-quarter earnings reflects 9.9% decline.Our proven model does not show that Ameren is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.31. Moreover, it carries a Zacks Rank #4.

Though the company didn’t announce any significant damage caused to its power plants, it is expected that the effect of the storm might weigh down on its profitability in the quarter.On the brighter note, the unemployment rate in CenterPoint Energy’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents for third-quarter earnings projects a decline of 1%. Meanwhile, the same for revenues of $2.02 billion hints at an improvement of almost 6.7% on a year-over-year basis.Our proven model does not show that CenterPoint Energy is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

This decision is likely to act as a strong catalyst for the company’s growth, since it will boost Pinnacle West’s Arizona Public Service unit’s revenues by an estimated 3.3%. Notably the new rates, effective from Aug 19, will increase the residential bill by approximately 4.5% or about $6 per month. We may expect the rate increase to get reflected in improved revenues of APS in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company projects to witness extended outages at its Four Corners power plant, in the second half of this year for the installation of pollution control equipment. This is expected to push up its operating and maintenance cost for third and fourth quarters of 2017, which in turn may dent the bottom line for coming quarters.Our proven model does not show that Pinnacle West is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayFirstEnergy expects its third quarter earnings in the range of 75 -90 cents per share, while Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 85 cents, reflecting an increase of 11.8% year-over-year.The company’s modernization drive and its “Energizing the Future” plan will help in upgrading and expanding its transmission capabilities.FirstEnergy’s competitive business customers at the end of the second quarter were 850,000, much lower than 1.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The drop can be attributed due to the company’s transition from its Competitive Generation to a fully transition to a regulated company. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FirstEnergy’s revenue is pegged at $3,571 million much lower than $3,828 million in the year-ago period.While the ongoing transition has adversely affected FirstEnergy’s customer count, we expect the company’s constant upgradation and modernization efforts to provide some cushion and maintain load growth for the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that FirstEnergy is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Moreover, Public Service Enterprise outperformed the same in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.50%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the first-quarter earnings call, Public Service Enterprise said that in the second quarter its key subsidiary, Power, will be impacted by incremental depreciation expenses related to the early retirement of the Hudson and Mercer coal-fired generating stations on Jun 1.However, the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the to-be-reported quarter. This, in turn, will result in higher household expenditures on heating, which is expected to drive revenues.Additionally, the unemployment rate in Public Service Enterprise’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects year-over-year growth of 0.35%, while revenues are pegged at $2.33 billion depicting an increase of 22.49%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Public Service Enterprise will beat earnings this quarter.

58,PNW,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly results as of Apr 27. Going by the positive trends, the first quarter is poised to record the strongest earnings and revenue growth in seven years. Earnings for the S&P 500 members that have already reported are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10.0% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating EPS estimates and 73.8% surpassing revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview report, overall earnings in the first quarter for all the S&P 500 members are expected to be up 22.6% on 8.4% growth in revenues.Amid the positive earnings outlook for the first quarter, let’s concentrate on the domestic-focused matured Zacks Utility sector. This sector, along with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is likely to come up with improved year-over-year earnings. Currently, only the Autos sector is likely to register an earnings decline.The Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13.9% year over year on 1.4% growth in revenues, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. The need for heating, stemming from cold weather conditions, and increased demand for electricity aided the utilities. Additionally, tax reforms also helped the utilities in lowering their tax burden substantially.Utilities, apart from investing in generating plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amount of emissions, are also focused on improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and guiding investors for efficient usage of electricity.  However, the rate-sensitive capital-intensive utility stocks are also accommodating the rate hikes. Notably, the Fed rate has now been raised for the sixth time (latest in March 2018) since the first hike in December 2015.Let’s take a look at the Utility stocks, scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 2and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Pinnacle West Capital Corporation (PNW  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 90% in the last reported quarter.
