28,BBT,"Congress is set to give a bunch of banks more of what they want — which is to say, fewer regulators in their lives — with legislation making its way through the Senate this week.X The Senate on Tuesday voted to begin debate on a bill that would free some banks from taking stress tests, drafting plans to show how they'd wind down in a crisis, and being ""too big to fail.""The legislation has the backing of the GOP and some Democrats, and could pass the chamber this week. But how will it actually affect the biggest banks, like Dow Jones industrial average components JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and others?""In a very limited way,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Gardner said. ""The bill is geared toward smaller banks — banks under $250 billion in assets.""He later added: ""You'll see this rhetoric that this going back to the bad old days, and this is, say, a giveaway to the big banks. Not to the biggest banks it's not.""Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

29,BBT,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowAs the bill stands now — and its language could change if the big banks' lobbying efforts are successful — the largest banks would still be subject to the Federal Reserve's stress tests. The dividend and buyback bonanza that comes after the banks typically pass those tests is unlikely to be affected. The rules would make it easier for big banks to buy municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal noted. But Gardner said that's ""not a needle mover.""However, analysts say that smaller banks — who may have been reluctant to expand out of fear of regulatory costs — could be encouraged to get bigger through mergers and acquisitions if the bill were passed.The Fed's annual evaluation of the financial system would no longer apply to banks with less than $100 billion in assets. After 18 months, those requirements would no longer apply to banks with assets ranging from $100 billion to $250 billion.The bill would also raise to $250 billion the amount of assets a bank has to have to be deemed systemically important to the financial system — a huge hike from the current $50 billion.""Let's say you and I are a regional bank, and we have a $100-$125 billion of assets,"" CFRA analyst Ken Leon said. ""Now all of a sudden I can look tactically at acquisitions of banks for $10 to $50 billion.""He added: ""There's been a five-year delay on M&A in the banking industry.""Smaller banks like BB&T (BBT), SunTrust (STI), People's United (PBCT), Signature Bank (SBNY) and East-West Bank (EWBC) are among those could benefit, Gardner said.The Senate debate comes as Wall Street awaits the next big boost for bank stocks, following the tax legislation President Trump signed into law in December. Those stocks have been trying to find support at their 50-day lines.Republicans have argued that the capital restraints on banks are unnecessary. Democrats have raised concerns that any easing of those restraints would encourage the behavior that landed the country in the financial crisis that occurred a decade ago.And JPMorgan and Citigroup have sought to squeeze other benefits from the bill that could meet resistance in Washington.In its current form, the bill appears to relax what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio for custodian banks — or a financial institution that protects assets like stocks and bonds for another financial firm and doesn't do retail banking. The supplementary leverage ratio gauges how big a bank's capital cushion needs to be in relation to its assets.Under the bill being debated by the Senate, banks would not have to factor in the deposits they hold at a central bank when calculating that ratio. Custodian banks, like Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), State Street (STT) and Northern Trust (NTRS) would be the likeliest to benefit.But JPMorgan and Citi, which also handle similar deposits, argue that provision should apply to them as well. Lobbyists for those banks have pressed legislators to modify the law accordingly. The Congressional Budget Office on Monday said the odds the banks would get their way stood at 50%, according to reports.The rule would also relieve many banks of the responsibility of putting together so-called ""living wills,"" or the plans that detail how a bank would dissolve, if it needed to, without dragging the economy down with it.Shares of JPMorgan closed up 0.1% in the stock market today.

37,BBT,"President Trump's hint this month of a breakup of big Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hit their stocks hard — for maybe 30 minutes. Then the stocks recovered and finished higher for the day.Little wonder. Financial deregulation looks like it's one of the few Trumponomics planks that investors can count on. Despite all the headlines, chaining off commercial banks from investment banking is probably a nonstarter now in Congress. But Trump has the will — and the political wherewithal — to bust up heavy regulations clamped on banks after the financial crisis.Capital requirements, stress-test thresholds, fee limits and trading curbs are some of the weights that Trump likely will lighten. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also likely will lose much of its budget and authority. These changes could boost bank profits, shareholder returns and M&A activity, as well as boost lending to businesses and consumers that accelerates economic growth.Hope for such deregulation is the reason shares of JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo and other banks large and small shot higher after Donald Trump's election.The stakes are huge: The excess capital that banks hold to comply with stress tests is estimated at well over $100 billion. They could return much of that money to shareholders via buybacks and dividends with the right reforms, such as reducing how many banks face Federal Reserve stress tests. If capital requirements are cut, excess capital could rise as high as $218 billion, Goldman Sachs analysts say.Regional banks also seek regulatory relief. Current rules imposed in the last eight years may discourage them from expanding beyond $10 billion in assets, where they'd face an additional regulator in the CFPB, more compliance and training requirements, and stress tests. Even small community banks face significant burdens, and they appear to have Trump's ear. Complaints include new mortgage-disclosure rules, caps on fees and heightened loan standards.Many local banks say they face unnecessary limits on whom they lend to and the products they offer. Their concerns are reflected in the declining number of banks. Only a few banks have been created since the financial crisis, suggesting that compliance costs and other red tape are too high and stifling new competition.""If I were the CEO of a small or community bank, an asset manager or an insurance company, I would be ecstatic"" over prospects for deregulation, said Douglas Elliott, a partner in Oliver Wyman's financial services consulting practice. ""There's virtually no downside.""For the largest banks, the regulatory outlook is ""more mixed,"" amid some high-level GOP support for Glass-Steagall and raising capital standards, but ""still overall a positive,"" Elliott said.Aligning oneself with big banks is still politically risky. The Republican Party platform molded by the populist Trump campaign endorsed reviving Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that split commercial and investment banking until its repeal in the late 1990s.But Trump's support for the idea was never strong or clear.In a Bloomberg News interview on May 1, Trump was asked if he wanted to break up the big banks. He made no commitment. Some people ""want to go back to the old system, right?"" he said. ""So we're going to look at that.""Those are hardly fighting words. And the reality is that even a tough fight would have a slim chance of winning in Congress, says KBW Washington analyst Brian Gardner. He figures Republicans opposed to Glass-Steagall would demand big concessions, such as killing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Democrats would reject that.By contrast, Trump clearly is serious about rolling back some Dodd-Frank provisions. The law is ""going to be very, very seriously changed so the banks can go back to loaning money,"" he told Bloomberg. Speaking to community bankers that same day, he blasted the law as being ""out of control,"" and ""not only for community banks — for banks, period.""Trump's diagnosis sounds a lot like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's. In an April letter to shareholders, Dimon argued that big U.S. banks should be freed from post-crisis capital requirements that exceed Basel international rules. That would unlock $15 billion of equity capital at JPMorgan and support nearly $190 billion of loans, he wrote.Eliminating the capital surcharge for the eight biggest U.S. banks could boost earnings by 4.6%, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods have estimated.Part of the bank rally after Trump's surprise election was relief that more onerous regulations wouldn't come into being. Not only has the Federal Reserve's regulatory regime been fairly strict for the eight globally systemically important banks, constraining their dividends and buybacks, but it was set to get even tougher if Hillary Clinton had become president, notes Elliott.On tap was ""a significant increase in capital requirements"" for megabanks under a policy outlined in September by Daniel Tarullo, who headed the Fed's committee on bank supervision and regulation. Tarullo turned in his resignation in February in the wake of Trump's victory.""People are policy,"" said RBC Capital banking analyst Gerard Cassidy, and Trump's election is bringing ""an incredible amount of turnover.""Trump's people, Cassidy told IBD, are likely to be ""pro-bank people, pro-business people, which would inevitably lead to more sound, common-sensical"" regulations. ""We do expect to see more returns of excess capital this year and next year, even if the legislation is not changed,"" he said.A House panel on Thursday voted on party lines for legislation that would roll back much of Dodd-Frank. The legislation could clear the full House, but the Senate would be a much higher hurdle.Policy analysts see two legislative ideas with enough support to get to Trump's desk. Elliott expects Republicans to ax the CFPB's budget. Supporters say the CFPB is a long-needed watchdog, citing September's $100 million fine on Wells Fargo for employees illegally opening 2 million deposit and credit-card accounts for unknowing customers. But its crackdown on payday lending has reduced access to small, short-term loans, while its 1,659-page rules on prepaid debit cards could choke off a popular product.As the CFPB shrinks and loses authority in the Trump era, ""restrictions on banking fees will slacken for all banks, which should help boost earnings,"" Oppenheimer Funds portfolio manager Benjamin Ram and research analyst Christopher Mashia wrote in a March analysis.Meanwhile, solid bipartisan support exists for raising the asset threshold by which banks become subject to the Fed's annual stress test, Elliott says. The level could rise from $50 billion to ""between $150 billion and $500 billion,"" he says.In his outgoing speech April 4, Tarullo agreed that the $50 billion threshold was ""set too low,"" adding that Dodd-Frank's risk-based capital requirements are ""unduly complicated"" for small banks.While Tarullo is gone, his endorsement could help pave the way for freeing community banks from Dodd-Frank's additional safety and soundness provisions for ensuring that their risk controls and financial conditions are adequate. There also is broad support for raising the $10 billion asset floor that triggers additional compliance and oversight, including a requirement for banks to conduct their own stress tests.Many superregional banks would be happy to do their own stress tests. In the Fed's stress tests, the agency provides little transparency about how it determines whether capital is sufficient, spurring banks to be ultraconservative in setting dividends to avoid surprises. No bank wants to be in the position of Zions Bancorp (ZION), when it was the only one to fail the Fed's stress test in 2014.Raising the Fed stress-test asset threshold likely would spark consolidation, creating cost-saving opportunities without triggering a special regulatory headache.If Congress raised the Fed stress-test threshold to $250 billion, 21 more financial institutions would be exempt. They include KeyCorp (KEY), American Express (AXP), BB&T (BBT) and SunTrust Banks (STI). Some 13 banks would still face strict scrutiny, with a few superregionals such PNC Financial (PNC) and US Bancorp (USB) still grouped with the globally systemically important banking giants.Prospects for regulatory relief and higher net-interest margins helped vault superregional and regional banks to the top of IBD's 197 industry-group rankings after the election. They held five of the top 10 positions in mid-February. The money-center bank group, including seven of the eight ""systemically important"" U.S. banks, got as high as No. 15. Since then, most bank stocks have fallen below their 50-day moving averages as interest rates have fallen and doubts have grown about Trumponomics, including tax cuts and infrastructure spending.The big question facing Trump's financial regulators will be whether the pendulum has swung too far toward safety and soundness at the expense of access to credit and economic growth.Under the Fed's stress test, which assumes a severe recession comparable to the crisis that began in 2007, systemically important banks are seen losing a combined $195 billion. But that's less than 10% of their capital of $2.2 trillion.""It's clear that banks can use more of their capital to finance the economy without sacrificing safety and soundness,"" Dimon wrote. ""Had they been less afraid of potential CCAR stress losses (the Fed's capital review process), banks probably would have been more aggressive in making some small business loans, lower rated middle market loans and near-prime mortgages.""Dimon says JPMorgan has turned away $200 billion in deposits from large clients because of new rules requiring that ""capital in many cases must be held on these short-term, virtually riskless activities.""While the biggest banks may not get regulatory relief as quickly as smaller banks, KBW estimates that the giants' earnings could rise 13.5% if ultrasafe assets such as Treasuries and deposits at the Fed are excluded from the leverage ratio, or capital as a percentage of assets.Tarullo's final speech also targeted Dodd-Frank's much-criticized Volcker Rule aimed at barring banks from trading for their own accounts, while still allowing them to act as market makers. He called the rule ""too complicated."" He said it was affecting market making, ""particularly for some less liquid issues.""An outright legislative Volcker Rule repeal could lift big-bank earnings by 4.2%, Goldman has estimated. The chances of that appear negligible, though Trump regulators likely will try to ease compliance.RELATED:Markets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanBreakout Watch: Top Financial Stock Jumps Back Into Buy ZoneMorgan Stanley Beats Estimates As Fixed-Income Revenue DoublesGoldman Sacked: Wall Street Giant Blames Politics For Trading Woes

38,BBT,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 fell slightly in Sunday evening trading. Dow futures edged down 0.1% while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.2%.The major averages all rose slightly in the past week, with the Nasdaq composite briefly setting an all-time high on Friday.But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), both Dow industrials components, retreated last week, along with Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and a slew of other banks. Several bank stocks, notably Goldman and Morgan Stanley, are testing their 50-day moving averages.The Federal Reserve's decision not to signal faster interest rate hikes after Wednesday's expected quarter-point increase buoyed most stocks. But banks sold off as Treasury yields fell, especially at the high end. Lower yields and a flatter curve between short- and long-term maturities hurts banks' borrow short, lend long profit model.IBD'S TAKE: Financial stocks often are sensitive to interest rates swings, but not all: Here's a big-cap financial stock that in buy range now.JPMorgan, which gapped up at the beginning of March as investors priced in the March 15 Fed hike, fell about 1% in Friday stock market trading, essentially at its lowest levels of the month, but still not too close to its rising 50-day line.Fellow Dow stock Goldman Sachs sank 1.7% to 243.92 on Friday, closing just above its 50-day line. So did the other big pure-play investment bank Morgan Stanley, which retreated 2.8% Friday.Bank of America sank 1.4% on Friday, but is comfortably above its 50-day line. BofA tested its 50-day in early February, then had a solid advance through March 1.Citigroup, which was one of the few big banks to trade below its 50-day line earlier this year, fell 1.3% to 60.37 on Friday. Citigroup crossed a 61.73 buy point several times this month, but never closed above that level.PNC Financial (PNC) is approaching its 50-day line, Regions Financial (RF) briefly undercut that level on Friday, while BB&T Corp. (BBT), Keycorp (KEY) and Suntrust Financial (STI) all closed the week below that support area.Keep in mind that in most of these cases, the stock are not far multi-year highs.In Asian Monday intraday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose to its best levels since 2015. Stocks also edged higher in China, while falling in Australia and South Korea.

39,BBT,"The rally in regional banks has moderated, but two ETFs that track the industry are using that pause to refresh their charts.The charts of SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and iShares U.S. Regional Banks (IAT) look like twins, the way they've behaved so similarly. Both have pulled back from highs reached at the start of March and are testing the 50-day moving average.With a bit more of a bounce, both exchange traded funds will be in buy areas. At the moment, the support at the 50-day line is not convincing enough. Watch for shares of both to climb at least one more point, and preferably in above-average volume.No chart reader would dispute that both ETFs were in need of a break. They shot up starting in mid-November on a combination of rising interest rates and President Trump's election. Trump and Republicans are trying to ease banking regulations, and higher rates are widening interest margins for banks.While SPDR Regional Banking has 100 stocks, iShares Regional Banks has about half as many.Still, the two portfolios are similar in terms of the largest holdings. PNC Financial Services (PNC), SunTrust Bank (STI), M&T Bank (MTB), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), Regions Financial (RF), Citizens Financial (CFG) and BB&T (BBT) are top-10 holdings in both funds.The two differ in that iShares Regional Banks has a big stake in U.S. Bancorp (USB) (more than 16% of the portfolio) while the superregional bank doesn't even make the SPDR Regional Banking portfolio.The holdings of SPDR Regional Banking are more spread out, with no single stock accounting for more than 4% of the total weighting.With the Federal Reserve expected to increase interest rates by a quarter-point two more times this year, the fundamental backdrop for regional banks is generally favorable. Higher rates tend to widen the margin between interest earned on loans vs. interest paid on deposits.LPL Financial, for example, had this to say: ""Steepening yield curve, deregulation, expanded credit access, strong fourth quarter 2016 earnings, and positive revisions are all supportive.""But Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research, saw an economic warning sign in the banking sector. ""In the U.S., bank loan growth has slowed significantly since Q4 and the Atlanta Fed's GDP nowcast is only indicating 1.2% U.S. growth for the current quarter, compared to over 2.5% as recently as early February."" The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

59,BBT,"_informq.push(['embed']);In San Francisco, an Indian software engineer on a work permit canceled plans to bid on a $900,000 home. In Washington, a Brazilian nonprofit executive passed on a fixer-upper near her office. And, in Mesa, Ariz., a 24-year-old son of undocumented Mexican immigrants won the trust of a bank — a green light for a mortgage — but now fears deportation.President Trump's immigration policies threaten to crack a foundation of the American economy: the residential real estate market. Legal and otherwise, immigrants, long a pillar of growth in homebuying, are no longer feeling the warm welcome and optimism necessary for their biggest purchase.""I feel like with one stroke of Trump's signature everything can be taken away, even all my hard work,"" said Juan Rodriguez, the 24-year-old whose parents moved from Mexico when he was 7. He now works full time while earning his college degree.President Obama had protected immigrants like Rodriquez, often called ""dreamers,"" or undocumented Americans who arrived as young children and are often fully integrated into American society.On Tuesday, the Trump administration detailed plans for a sweeping crackdown on undocumented immigrants, saying the authorities would deport many more people without court hearings. Under Obama, the government focused on those convicted of violent crimes; Trump would lower the bar to include fraud and, in some cases, a belief the residents threatened public safety.Even workers with green cards and work visas under the H-1B program for skilled foreign workers are worried about possible restrictions under Trump. The housing markets most at risk include Miami, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, which have the biggest concentrations of foreign-born buyers.While the Trump administration indicated it would exempt dreamers, stepped-up immigration raids and the travel ban on seven majority-Muslim countries — blocked in court — are creating panic in many who believed that their American dream was within sight.""If Trump gets the immigration plan he wants, the housing market will get hit harder than any other,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, a policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute. If ""millions of people get deported and more people don't come in to take their place, then you'll have downward pressure on home prices, especially in urban areas.""The immigrant housing market is often underappreciated, in part, because undocumented workers and the companies that cater to them sometimes like to fly below the radar.Some smaller firms will make loans to the undocumented, with higher interest rates. A few larger lenders such as Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based BB&T (BBT) market to dreamers, who can qualify for conventional Fannie Mae (FNMA), Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Federal Housing Administration mortgages.A third of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. live in a home that they or a family member or friend own, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.Now, some lenders are starting to get nervous. Las Vegas-based Alterra Home Loans focuses on mortgages for immigrants, including dreamers and the undocumented. At the early stages of government loans, lenders can be on the hook in defaults. ""We're proceeding cautiously,"" said Jason Madiedo, the company's president and chief executive officer.If financing dries up and borrowers lose faith, it will mark a major reversal in the market. New arrivals are expected to account for more than a third of growth of homeowners this decade, according to University of Southern California demographer Dowell Myers.While the U.S. homeownership rate in 2015 was the same as it was in 1994 — 66% — it has risen 2.4 percentage points for the foreign-born population, to more than half, according to real estate website Trulia.Fueling housing demand, immigrants replace baby boomers retiring from the labor force, according to University of Washington economist Jacob Vigdor.By his reckoning, the country's 40 million immigrants add $3.7 trillion to total housing wealth. In Houston's home county, the newcomers boosted the value of the typical home by $25,000 during the decade ended in 2010. Between 2015 and 2065, according to a Pew Research projection, future immigrants and their descendants will account for 88% of the U.S. population increase, or 103 million people.Other foreign buyers could step in. Trump's friendly stance toward Russian President Vladimir Putin is heartening buyers from that country. They had held back after his 2014 Crimean takeover prompted Obama to impose sanctions, according to Edward Mermelstein, a New York-based real estate lawyer who represents wealthy foreigners. His Russian clients negotiating home purchases in New York and Miami more than doubled since Trump took office.But, among groups targeted by Trump, conversations around kitchen tables are now less about payments and more about politics.Even immigrants with high-paying jobs and valid visas are getting skittish. Two of them asked not to be identified because of fears of recrimination.The 32-year-old Silicon Valley software engineer from India gave up on buying because Trump had so rattled him and his wife. He moved to the U.S. seven years ago and decided to become a homeowner after marrying a biomedical engineer from his home country a few months ago.The newlyweds have H-1B visas, a program that technology and other companies rely on to hire 85,000 people each year.""We were about to make some offers,"" he said. ""But we don't know what news will come out and how that will affect our jobs.""Their real estate agent, Nomita Shahani, said a colleague in her office just had a customer with an H-1B visa pull out of a purchase contract in Fremont, Calif., because of similar concerns.""All morning clients have been calling me,"" Shahani said. ""We don't know which way it will go, but if Trump keeps making it hard to hire people from overseas, the housing market will take a hit.""Even immigrants who marry U.S. citizens are losing faith. The 36-year-old Brazilian nonprofit executive, whose husband is an American, is six months away from a permanent green card, one step behind citizenship. After the travel ban and the ensuing chaos, she abandoned plans to bid on a Maryland home only a 15-minute drive from her office.""I just don't want to take my life savings and commit to a house because even if things go my way with the green card, what if the climate here continues to get more and more aggressive toward immigrants?"" said the executive, who is working with real estate brokerage Redfin.Others are even factoring deportation into their homebuying plans. Yadira Hernandez, a 24-year-old dreamer who was 5 years old when she arrived in Phoenix with her mother, isn't giving up her search.While scouting property in the $175,000 range, she's also planning for the worst. If she gets deported, she'll rely on a family member to take over mortgage payments.Hernandez, who has two children and is working full time as a credit counselor, has a goal in her sights: ""I would be the first person in my family to own a house.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Are These The Hottest-Selling Suburbs In U.S.?U.S. Homebuyers' Break-Even Point Just Got A Little More DistantSurvey Finds That The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In AmericaTrending Home Improvement Projects For 2017's Housing Market

""The market had two distinct parts,"" said Mark Travis, lead manager of $399 million Intrepid Capital Fund (ICMBX). ""A lot of investors struggled until Halloween. After that, the market shifted into inflows in the next six, seven weeks.""That inflow — starting shortly before the election — helped the S&P 500 finish the year up 12%. U.S. diversified stock funds closed 2016 with a 10.81% gain on average after advancing 4.06% in the fourth quarter, according to Lipper Inc.Small-cap value funds led the way, gaining 26.78% for the year on top of a 12.33% Q4 leap.Click Here To See All Articles And Tables In IBD's Best Mutual Funds Performance ReportMutual Fund Precious metals funds, driven by volatility, paced sectors with a 54.78% surge despite losing 21.43% in Q4.

""First, the Federal Reserve meeting on Dec. 14, when they raised rates. The real news that investors reacted to was that they would raise rates three more times in 2017. That took the market by surprise. All of a sudden, some euphoria of the postelection rally dissipated in the face of the headwind in the form of monetary policy.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceInvestors' realization that the U.S. dollar was rising and could hurt exports by U.S. large-cap multinationals also tapped the market's brakes, Joy says. ""Investors decided to slow things down,"" he said. But he added that in the new year's first week of trading, amid renewed market gains, ""investors seem to have decided that maybe the optimism is warranted.""That investor optimism is fueled by expectations of strengthening economic growth in the U.S. and elsewhere. It's also driven by anticipation of U.S. corporate and personal tax cuts, says Brian Nick, TIAA Global Asset Management chief investment strategist.At the sector level, Joy expects financial services stocks to benefit from rising rates, faster economic growth and a lighter regulatory burden — ""especially in the banking sector,"" he said.He expects the recent OPEC deal to cut production to fuel ""earnings throughout the energy complex, including in the U.S., where rig counts are rising and capital expenditures and drilling are up,"" he said.And faster economic growth should help drive the technology sector, especially innovative companies in cybersecurity, cloud computing and data storage, Joy says. Still, he cautions that a rising dollar could temper growth in tech, ""which gets more of its revenue from overseas than any other sector,"" Joy added.Banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is the largest U.S. financial stock held by the Ameriprise-owned Columbia mutual fund complex, according to Morningstar Inc. Exxon Mobil (XOM) is the group's largest U.S. energy stake.IBD'S TAKE: JPMorgan Chase is No. 3 in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its very strong 96 IBD Composite Rating and four quarters of earnings per share (EPS) acceleration stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.And tech titans Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB) are the complex's three largest U.S. stock holdings in any sector.Jay Wong, head of equity strategy of Payden & Rygel and co-manager of its $884.5 million Equity Income Fund (PYVAX), says that dividend-paying stocks generally do fine in rising rate environments. Dividends also tend to provide a buffer against slow share-price gains or price setbacks.One dividend stock he likes is regional bank BB&T (BBT), which has a strong Composite Rating of 92 from IBD. ""Its profit margins should increase as interest rates rise,"" Wong said. ""Relative to some bigger banks, it has higher sensitivity to rate increases. It's got a dividend yield of 2.6%, with a double-digit dividend growth rate in the past five years.""Tech is his fund's second-largest sector. Microsoft is a favorite. ""They're making the transition from being a PC-based business to a cloud-based one,"" Wong said. ""They have an excellent cash position, a 2.5% dividend yield, which is above the market average, and its dividend grew in excess of 15% annually over the past five years. That's a nice income generator that will continue to do well.""Verizon (VZ) is a dividend stock liked by Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of $271 million Goodhaven Fund (GOODX). ""They're in a business that's down to only a few competitors,"" he said. ""Their main earnings are from their wireless subsidiary. That's a product or service that people can't seem to live without. They have the best spectrum footprint (national signal-availability area). (Data transmission) speeds are getting faster. Over time, it has modest but consistent growth. And it's very shareholder friendly, with a substantial dividend yield in excess of 4%. Where can you get a 4% yield without the risk of the high-yield space or emerging markets debt?""Risks in the new year include geopolitical conflict and threats to eurozone stability, Nick says.On the domestic front, prospects for all of the Trump-promised goodies that investors are expecting should become clear within the first half of the year. ""My outlook is constructive for the first third of the year,"" Joy said. ""After that, there's potential for the markets to shift. By April or so, we should have a good sense of how the new administration's policy initiatives are faring.""Since markets tend to buy on the anticipation of new developments and sell on any actual news, around April is when investors may reassess their current bullishness. Joy added: ""Once we get to that point, markets may look around and say, 'You know, the high hopes are already incorporated in prices.' Then we could start to see some profit-taking.""RELATED:Click Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual FundsWhere Vanguard CEO McNabb Sees Fund Giant, Industry Headed In 2017Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20176 Steps To Take With Your Financial Action Plan Now

65,BBT,"Big banks JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) got through the second and final round of the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests unscathed, resulting in a shareholder-returns bonanza shortly after the test results were announced late Wednesday.But Morgan Stanley's (MS) capital plan only got conditional approval, and U.S. segments of Deutsche Bank (DB) and Santander (SAN) failed once againStill, Morgan Stanley said it will move forward with a 33% quarterly dividend hike to 20 cents and a $3.5 billion buyback. JPMorgan OK'd a $10.6 billion buyback but kept its dividend the same. Bank of America announced a $5 billion repurchase program and a 50% payout increase to 7.5 cents. Citigroup will buy back $8.6 billion in stock and raised its payout to 16 cents from 5 cents.Goldman Sachs (GS) didn't give specifics but said its plan included buybacks and a dividend hike. Wells Fargo (WFC)  kept its capital plans unchanged.Morgan Stanley stock were little changed in pre-market trading on the stock market today after rising late Wednesday JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup climbed 2.4%, Wells Fargo rose and Goldman Sachs all rose fractionally. Deutsche Bank, which the IMF said ""poses the greatest risk to the global financial system,"" sank nearly 4% while Santander fell 2%.Other banks also announced bigger returns to shareholders.The Fed only gave conditional approval to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, in which it projected how it would perform under difficult economic conditions for this year's stress tests. As a result, Morgan must resubmit its capital plan and address broader concerns from the Fed by Dec. 29. If Morgan can't deliver on those promises, the Fed said, its governors ""would expect to object"" to the resubmitted plan, potentially hindering Morgan's shareholder returns.While the Fed did not technically object to Morgan Stanley's capital plan, the central bank said the company ""exhibited material weaknesses in its capital planning process,"" including in governance, modeling and other safeguards.""These weaknesses warrant further near-term attention but do not undermine the quantitative results of the stress tests for the firm,"" the Fed said, referring to the portion of the tests that quantifies what banks' capital levels would look like under financial turmoil.The Fed said Deutsche Bank and Santander, both of which also had their plans rejected last year, had tightened up some aspects of their capital planning methodology but still struggled with ""material unresolved supervisory issues that critically undermine (the) capital planning process.""The results follow a pattern of stress-test one-upmanship between the banks, which have been shoring up capital since the financial crisis, and the Fed, which has tried harder each year to catch the banks off-guard in the scenarios posed in the tests.While the banks that passed can move forward with their dividend and buyback hikes, tougher standards on the horizon could keep payouts restrained this year. Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo warned this month that banks in future tests might have to make a ""significant increase"" in the assets they set aside to cushion against a potential economic crisis.The final round of results from the stress tests -- known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR -- came after all 33 tested banks last week passed the first round of the evaluation, which quantifies how banks' finances would be affected against a barrage of market shocks.The Fed outlined the economic scenarios for both tests at the beginning of the year. In the weeks that followed, the banks submitted their capital plans, which this year forecast how they would do amid 10% unemployment, negative interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasuries -- among the conditions in the Fed's worst-case scenario.The first round of test results can serve as a preview of sorts to the second, in which the Fed actually indicates whether it accepted, rejected or had any reservations with the banks' capital plans. If it does have an issue, banks could have to temper plans to issue buybacks and boost dividends in order to pass.The second round of tests contains both a quantitative element and qualitative element. The quantitative element measures banks post-stress-test capital levels and whether they could sustain any new dividend and buyback plans. The qualitative element evaluates the soundness of the banks' capital plans and how they were developed.Analysts largely had not anticipated major problems with the banks' stress-test results.

82,BBT,"While CCAR has become the key test of banks' health since the Great Recession, Patrikis said he'd like to see the day when a bank's board — not the Fed — again has the power to return money to owners. ""Banks should be allowed to have more freedom to raise dividends,"" he said.

83,BBT,"In addition to the banks listed above, the Federal Reserve had no objections to the plans of Ally Financial (ALLY), American Express (AXP), Bank of New York Mellon (BK), BB&T (BBT), BBVA Compass (BBVA), Bank of Montreal Quebec (BMO), Capital One Financial (COF), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Discover Financial Services (DFS), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings (MTU), Northern Trust (NTRS), PNC Financial Services (PNC), Regions Financial (RF), State Street (STT), SunTrust Banks (STI) and U.S. Bancorp (USB).All but three of the 31 big banks examined by the Federal Reserve won approval of any plans to return capital to investors in the second round of annual stress tests. In other words: more payouts for shareholders.The U.S. units of Spain's Banco Santander (SAN) and Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB) failed round 2 of the Fed's stress tests, while the Fed ordered Bank of America  (BAC) to resubmit its capital plan by the end of the third quarter.It's the second straight year Santander failed the test. And the Fed cited ""numerous and significant deficiencies"" in Deutsche Bank's capital planning.Meanwhile, Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) boosted their dividends and Morgan approved a new buyback plan, joining other banks that received the Fed's OK of their capital plans.Shares of BofA fell 1% late, while Morgan Stanley rose 2% and Wells Fargo edged up 0.1%.The second round of the exams — the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) — is more stringent than round one, the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST), because it examines banks' abilities to pay dividends, buy back shares and still serve borrowers during times of severe economic distress.This year, the Fed examined 31 banks, each with assets exceeding $50 billion. All 31 banks passed DFAST last week, which means they met the Fed's minimum capital requirements. It was the first time they all passed since the test's 2009 inception.A More Likely Place To TripRound 2 is where banks are more likely to stumble. Michael Corbat, the CEO of Citigroup (C), should be breathing easier, since the New York-based lender passed this year's tests after failing two out of the last three years. Last year's failure resulted in Citi's selling overseas branches as well as selling its consumer finance unit, OneMain Financial, for $4.25 billion.This is the first year Citigroup will be able to boost its dividend since the financial crisis. Corbat and Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach's jobs reportedly were on the line during this year's stress tests. Citi's passage comes as a big win for them. Citi shares rose 3.7% in after-hours trading.HSBC (HSBC) and Zions Bancorp (ZION) failed last year's CCAR but passed this year's exam.Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley met minimum capital requirements on a post-test basis after submitting adjustments.""This is becoming less and less an adversarial process between the organizations,"" said Ernest Patrikis, a former New York Fed official now with the White & Case law firm. ""I think for the banking system as a whole, we should feel a bit better.""Musing Over Board ControlWhile CCAR has become the key test of banks' health since the Great Recession, Patrikis said he'd like to see the day when a bank's board — not the Fed — again has the power to return money to owners.

125,BBT,"The Fed will be announcing the results of bank stress tests on Jun 21 and results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis Review (""CCAR"") on Jun 28. The tests, which are an annual affair and a must for banks since the 2008 financial meltdown, are designed to ensure that they are in a healthy position to handle crisis during an economic downturn. Looking back, President Donald Trump in May signed the biggest rollback of bank regulations since the global economic downturn into law.The law has been designed to relax rules for all but the largest banks. The move is likely to significantly benefit community banks. And apart from suburban and rural banks, the new law is also expected to benefit regional and medium-sized institutions. Bank stocks have been performing well ever since Trump came to power and with Fed having already made two rate hikes this year, banks are likely to finally get benefited.New Stress Test to Benefit BanksStress tests have been in place since 2008 and are considered one of the most important measures to assess the ability of banks to withstand an economic crisis. However, in May, Trump signed the biggest rollback of financial regulations since the Dodd-Frank Act came to effect in 2010. The new law has raised the assets threshold for banks that are considered too important to fail from $50 billion to $250 billion. In doing so, it excluded all banks except the largest from stringent regulatory supervision.This certainly has freed small banks from the burden of being considered too big to fail. Thus the likes of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) will no longer need to submit themselves to periodic stress tests or submit plans known as living wills. Moreover, the new law cuts down mortgage loan data reporting requirements for most banks.The largest banks on the other hand will have to pass a stricter stress test. However, increasing the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion could provide the Federal Reserve with the “political cover” to further ease regulations governing such stress tests.Moreover, six foreign banks, namely Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DB  -  Free Report), BNP Paribas SA (BNPQY  -  Free Report), Credit Suisse Group AG (CS  -  Free Report), Barclays PLC (BCS  -  Free Report), Royal Bank of Canada (RY  -  Free Report) and UBS Group AG, have been included this year for the first time that will have to undergo the stress test.Banks to Pay Record DividendsDespite a tougher stress test, the largest U.S. banks are expected to pay out more than what they earn for the first time since the economic crisis. According to a Financial Times report, shareholders of 22 of the largest lenders in the United States are estimated to receive around $170 billion in dividends and stock buyout in 2018, almost 25% more than last year.Among these, JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc (C  -  Free Report) are leading the race. Per a Bloomberg report, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America is expected to pay out more than 100% of their profits over the next four quarters. These banks are likely to be followed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). JP Morgan has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.This implies that the largest commercial banks are most likely to pass the Fed’s stress test. Moreover, the Fed too thinks that the banking sector has successfully entered the next stage of its recovery since the financial crisis. Moreover, the Fed has already raised interest rates twice this year, which has resulted banks in charging their customers more, thus making their financial position even better.Summing UpThe new law certainly has made things easier for small commercial banks. On the other hand, the large banks are likely to announce record payouts to their shareholders for the first time since the economic crisis, which proves that they are in a position to comfortably pass the stress test.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

126,BBT,"Regional banks ETFs are rising this week. There are many reasons behind this trend.The economy is gaining momentum and most of the recent economic reports, including the jobs report, have been better than expected. Regional banks benefit from an improving economy as loan growth picks up.And rates are rising. The 10-year note yield, which was around 2.4% at the beginning of the year had surged to over 3.1% last month. It has since come down to around 2.95%, mainly due to geopolitical concerns.Rates have been inching higher again after the jobs report and the Fed appears all set to raise rates at its meeting next week.Last month, the congress approved the biggest roll-back of Dodd-Frank reforms that were enacted in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Small and regional banks are set to benefit from easing of these regulations.A strong economy and higher interest rates benefit all banks but regional banks stand to benefit more since interest rate spread is their main source of earnings.The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE  -  Free Report) is the most popular ETF in the space with $5.2 B in AUM. It’s an equal-weighted ETF with 120 holdings.The iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT  -  Free Report) has 53 holdings and top three holdings—U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report), PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) and BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report)--account for more than one-third of assets.The PowerShares KBW Regional Banking Portfolio (KBWR) also follows equal-weighing methodology.

Later, Ryan is joined by Dave Bartosiak to discuss Dodd-Frank reform.Want more video content from Zacks? Subscribe to Zacks Investment News now!Investors returned from the Memorial Day holiday to the news that Italy’s two anti-establishment parties—the progressive 5 Star and far-right The League—had stalled in their efforts to form a new government. This will likely trigger a revote and create more uncertainty about the country’s future in the European Union.Meanwhile, new reports suggested that the U.S. is on track to export a record amount of oil to Asia in the coming months, snagging more market share from Russia and OPEC. This comes on the back of news that Russia and OPEC might be forced to increase production to counteract a huge decline in Venezuelan output.On the first half of today’s Free Lunch, Ryan touches on both of these stories, so be sure to tune in and catch up with what you need to know this morning!Later in the episode, Ryan speaks to Zacks Strategist Dave Bartosiak about Wall Street regulation and the first major rollback of Dodd-Frank rules which sought to keep control of America’s financial institutions. Dodd-Frank was enacted in response to the Great Recession, but many felt the law went too far. Now, some aspects of the bill are being overturned, giving more leeway to all but the largest banks in the country.The new “deregulation” will have the most impact on companies operating between unique thresholds in terms of assets, including American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), PNC (PNC  -  Free Report), and BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report).Interested in hearing about both sides of the Dodd-Frank argument?

128,BBT,"Late on May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a bill loosening Obama-era regulations on the banking industry. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act not only eases rules for banks, it sets the stage for further deregulation by multiple agencies. President Trump is widely expected to sign the bill into law before Memorial Day. According to House Speaker Paul Ryan, the new bill is likely to significantly benefit community banks. However, apart from suburban and rural banks, the bill is also expected to benefit regional and medium-sized institutions. With additional rate hikes also around the corner, investing in select bank stocks looks like a smart option.   House Approves Bill Easing Bank RulesOn Tuesday, the House voted 258 to 159 to approve the bipartisan Senate-drafted legislation which significantly deregulates the banking industry. The bill raised the assets threshold for banks which are considered too important to fail from $50 billion to $250 billion. In doing so, it excluded all banks except the largest from stringent regulatory supervision.As a result, the likes of SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) will no longer have to submit themselves to periodic stress tests or submit plans known as living wills. These plans outline how a bank proposes to be wound up in case it faces bankruptcy.The bill also cuts down mortgage loan data reporting requirements for most banks. New measures have been introduced for those taking student loans. Additionally, credit reporting agencies will now be required to offer credit monitoring services at no charge. Further Deregulation on the AnvilThe new legislation also gives regulators greater discretion to decide at what point banks holding $100 billion to $250 billion in assets would have to undergo stress tests for capital adequacy. Such a need would, of course, only arise in case another financial crisis takes place.This doesn’t exclude the largest banks from stress tests altogether. But, increasing the threshold from $50 billion to $250 billion could provide the Federal Reserve with the “political cover” to further ease regulations governing such stress tests. These tests are collectively termed Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR.Further, multiple agencies, including the SEC and the Fed, have powers to amend the manner in which the Volcker Rule is implemented. Congressional approval would not be required in such an event. For instance, regulators plan to remove an assumption that defines positions held by banks for a period led than 60 days as speculative. Our ChoicesIn keeping with Trump’s electoral promises, the new bill passed by the House has greatly eased banking regulations. Further, it has set the stage for further deregulation which will likely be undertaken by multiple financial agencies.Investing in banking stocks looks like a smart option at this point.

129,BBT,"Muted trading business is unlikely to support Goldman Sachs’ (GS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2018 earnings, to be reported on Jul 17. However, benefits of higher rates and relatively better performance of other segments — mainly investing and lending — are anticipated to aid earnings.Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Volatility-driven growth in trading revenues, which supported the top line during the January-March quarter, is likely to have remained muted in the second quarter. Though uncertainty, mainly related to the U.S.-China trade war and some other geo-political tensions, induced volatility, client activity returned to normalized levels in the April-June quarter. Therefore, not much support is expected from this source of revenues as fixed income business is likely to have slowed down during the period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Institutional Client Services division, of which the major portion comprises fixed income revenues, reflects a decline of 18.2% sequentially.Additionally, the investment management unit of Goldman is projected to have supported earnings. Prior investments in fixed income, alternatives and low-cost index funds are expected to continue to reap benefits to some extent. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this division projects a rise of 6.7% year over year.Here are the other factors that might influence Goldman’s Q2 results:Investment Banking Fees to Report Modest Results: The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance is unlikely to have remained in the second quarter, as rising rates will have limited corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this might have adversely impacted Goldman’s revenues.However, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As will likely help banks partially offset the lost revenues. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are predicted to increase. Thus, Goldman is also likely to report a decent quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the investment banking segment is pegged at $1.8 billion, up 5.9% year over year.Investing & Lending to Get a Boost: Improved corporate performance and rising rates are expected to have driven revenues from this source. In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, and consumer — is anticipated to have perked up revenues. Nonetheless, lower asset values recorded during the quarter might have partially offset this rise. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investing and lending segment is projected at $1.7 billion, up 6.3% year over year.Strong Expense Management: Goldman is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will unlikely be a major support. Furthermore, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might have impacted Goldman’s earnings unusually.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Goldman does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Goldman carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

The figure recorded 31.1% surge from the year-ago quarter.Results reflected a slight rise in revenues and lower operating expenses. However, higher credit costs and a decline in loan balance were the undermining factors.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $745 million or 94 cents per share, up from $378 million or 46 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Grow Slightly, Expenses DeclineTotal revenues (taxable-equivalent) came in at $2.84 billion, up marginally year over year.

Net interest margin fell 2 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.44%.Non-interest income increased nearly 1% year over year to $1.18 billion. Higher investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, and bankcard fees and merchant discounts were partly offset by decline in insurance income and mortgage banking income.Non-interest expenses of $1.69 billion fell 19.8% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower outside IT services costs and net merger-related and restructuring charges, as well as absence of loss on early extinguishment of debt.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.3%, down from 58.0% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates rise in profitability.As of Mar 31, 2018, total deposits were nearly $158.2 billion, up marginally from the prior quarter. Total loans and leases of $144.2 billion were down slightly on a sequential basis.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $669 million, down 16.5% year over year.

However, allowance for loan and lease losses came in at 1.05% of total loans and leases held for investment, up 1 bp from the prior-year quarter.Also, provision for credit losses was $150 million at the end of the quarter, reflecting a 1.4% increase on a year-over-year basis.Strong Profitability & Capital RatiosAt the end of the reported quarter, return on average assets was 1.45%, up from 0.79% in the prior-year quarter. Return on average common equity improved to 11.43% from 5.72% as of Mar 31, 2017.As of Mar 31, 2018, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12%, on par with the year-ago quarter. BB&T's estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III was approximately 10.2% as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 10.3% as of Mar 31, 2017.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, BB&T repurchased $320 million worth shares through open-market purchases.OutlookSecond-Quarter 2018On a sequential basis, management projects GAAP NIM to be stable year over year while core margins are expected to increase.Fee income is anticipated to be up 2% to 4% year over year. On an annualized basis, total loans are expected to be up 1-3% sequentially.Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, and other one-time items, management expects expenses to decline 1-3% year over year.Management expects the effective tax rate to be 21%.Management projects NCOs to increase sequentially and be in the range of 30-45 bps on the assumption that there is no deterioration in the economy. Also, loan loss provisions are expected to match NCOs in addition to providing for loan growth.2018Also, total average loans are projected to rise in the range of 1-3%.Management expects revenues (tax-equivalent basis) to grow in 2-4% range year over year in 2018.

131,BBT,"BankUnited, Inc.’s (BKU  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 77 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. Moreover, the bottom line compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 57 cents per share.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and lower provisions. Moreover, the company’s overall loans and deposit balances remained strong. However, higher expenses and lower non-interest income were the undermining factors.Net income for the quarter was $85.2 million, up from $62.3 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Income Improves, Costs EscalateNet revenues for the quarter were $275.8 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $265.3 million. Further, the reported figure increased 6.6% year over year.Net interest income for the quarter came in at $247.8 million, increasing 7.5% year over year, led by higher interest income, partially offset by rise in interest expenses.Net interest margin contracted 14 basis points year over year to 3.56%.Non-interest income was $28 million, edging down nearly 1% from the year-ago quarter. The fall was primarily due to lower net income from resolution of covered assets.Non-interest expenses increased 3.4% from the year-ago quarter to $161.8 million, primarily due to rise in employee compensation and benefit costs, depreciation of equipment under operating lease and other non-interest expenses.Credit Quality: Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.20%, decreasing from 0.38% as of Dec 31, 2017.

Also, return on average stockholders’ equity was 11.28%, up from 10.08% at the end of the prior-year quarter.Our TakeSupported by consistent growth in loans and deposits, BankUnited remains on track for top-line improvement in the future. Also, given a solid liquidity and balance sheet position, the bank is well poised to grow through acquisitions.However, persistently increasing expenses and continued margin pressure (despite increase in interest rates) remain major near-term concerns.BankUnited, Inc.

135,BBT,"The long-time demand of banks to scale back stringent regulations is finally a reality. The House passed a crucial bill easing some provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that were put in place as safeguard against repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.The House passed the bill on Tuesday backed by majority voting of 258 to 159, promising it to be beneficial for small and mid-sized banks. It would now be presented to President Donald Trump for signing, with the Senate already having passed the legislation in March.Highlights of the BillPerhaps the most significant relief from the bill is the reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill will eventually raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.Banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later. This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 38.Therefore, banks including SunTrust (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief. These banks will not be required to undergo annual stress tests or submit so-called ‘living wills,’ both necessitated as measures to plan for financial disaster. So, this will eventually lower regulatory compliance costs.Further, the move will likely lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Other than this, the bill will lower the amount of capital required to be held by the custodian banks. The bill will allow these companies to set aside the money they received from clients and immediately send it to the Fed or some other central bank for safety. Thus, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) custodian banks — State Street (STT  -  Free Report), BNY Mellon and Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report) — will be the major gainers.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, banks with less than $10 billion in assets will be exempted from complying with the Volker Rule, which prohibits proprietary trading. The bill also eases mortgage loan data reporting requirements for several banks and credit unions as well as relaxes rules on what type of real estate loans smaller community banks can make.Additionally, the legislation will add new safeguards for student loan borrowers and necessitate credit reporting companies like Equifax and TransUnion to provide free credit monitoring services.Is Dodd-Frank Hurting Banks’ Financials?The Dodd-Frank Act has been criticized by small and medium banks for tougher rules that have made it difficult of them to do business and remain profitable. But in reality, did the law actually hurt their profitability?Well, if we go by the figures, banks have continued to earn significant profits. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported record earnings of $56 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 27.5% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 92% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $6.1 billion, 17.7% above the prior-year quarter level.While one can say that improving economy and higher interest rates have supported banks, strict rules have also played their part to some extent in aiding the financials.Monitoring by regulatory bodies has helped banks to keep a check on their operations and maintain sufficient capital cushion to avoid another financial crisis. By establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to oversee credit cards, mortgages and other financial products as well as other regulatory bodies to check for signs of instability, the Dodd-Frank Act provided stability to the banking industry.Road AheadThe bill is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations. Still, it is the most important step to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth (as seen by many) and lending activities.But the legislation is of little help to some of the nation’s biggest banks (in term of assets) like JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), PNC Financial, Goldman and Wells Fargo. Notably, further discussions seem to be going on about lowering capital requirements and easing other restrictions on these banks.Later this month, the banking regulators are expected to release a proposal to weaken the Volker Rule for big banks. Further, the CFPB interim head has significantly scaled back the agency’s activities and stopped probes into finance companies.Thus, in the coming days, more regulatory easing is expected. These will definitely help the banks to further improve profitability. Also, shareholders might expect more returns in the form of buybacks and dividends.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

137,BBT,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 16, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, no provisions and a significant rise in total client assets, and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained headwinds.Moreover, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history as its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive surprise of nearly 3.8%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteHowever, activities of Schwab during the first quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained unchanged at 53 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 35.9%.Notably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 35.7% in the past year, outperforming 31.2% growth recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, it is quite likely that Schwab will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +0.31%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsOverall trading activities remained strong during the quarter, driven by significant market volatility, specifically in the months of February and March. Notably, Schwab opened 165,000 and 138,000 new brokerage accounts in January and February, respectively, indicating that investors were interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the first quarter is 10,936, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 6%.Thus, with growth in brokerage accounts, Schwab’s trading revenues might have witnessed improvement in the quarter.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in January and February on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the entire quarter.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the quarter is $3.5 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 18.8%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $233 billion, which is expected to grow 7.4% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues should support overall revenue growth in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the to-be-reported quarter is $2.34 billion, which reflects growth of 12.7% year over year.However, Schwab’s operating expenses have remained elevated for the past few quarters. Moreover, because of higher compensation and benefits cost, overall expenses are expected to remain high in the first quarter.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

138,BBT,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 13, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial. The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence, which led to loan growth. Also, the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank.Moreover, PNC Financial’s bottom line is expected to benefit from lower tax rates as it is likely to have retained a remarkable part of its revenues. Also, improved M&A and equity underwriting activities during the quarter are likely to drive fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $4.15 billion indicates a 6.8% year-over-year improvement.Before we discuss the factors that might impact PNC Financial’s first-quarter results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s fourth-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income. These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses.Notably, the company delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 4.1%.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the past year, shares of PNC Financial have gained 32.7%, outperforming the 21.8% growth recorded by the industry.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: PNC Financial might report higher interest income as the quarter continued to witness rise in interest rates and improvement in lending scenario. The U.S. consumer sentiment reached its highest level since 2004 during the quarter along with the unemployment rate remaining at record low levels. Such factors are likely to have led to upbeat lending activities.Also, the company’s net interest margin (NIM) is likely to expand with support from two rate hikes since December 2017. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, NIM is expected to expand 15 basis points to 2.92%, year over year.Notably, the consensus estimate for net interest income is projected to be $2.34 billion, up 8.4% year over year.Controlled Expenses: The company has a cost-saving program in place for the year to keep expenses under control. Also, management expects non-interest expenses to be down by low-single digits on a sequential basis.Lower Mortgage Banking Revenues: The company is likely to continue witnessing lower revenues from this division owing to slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates. Per the consensus estimate, residential mortgage revenues are likely to decline 9.7% to $102 million in the first quarter, on a year-over-year basis.Non-Interest Income Might Rise: As the first quarter was decent in terms of investment banking and equity underwriting business due to higher volumes of M&As, the related fees are expected to increase marginally.However, debt underwriting activities during the quarter were not encouraging, so the related fees are likely to remain muted.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that PNC Financial will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. Note that a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has significantly higher chances of beating estimates.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Nevertheless, with earnings estimates for the first quarter been revised slightly upward over the last 30 days, the company is expected to witness 23.5% year-over-year earnings growth.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

139,BBT,"Considering how many game-changing headlines we’ve seen so far in 2018 — from inflation/interest rate fears to geopolitical hornets nests to Washington DC soap operas — this has been a welcome week for the stock markets. Just think if we’d have had some seasonably appropriate weather — we’d be on Cloud 9 right now! And this relative calm in a sea of turbulence continues ahead of the opening bell this morning, with Initial Jobless Claims and new Q1 earnings results hitting the tape.Initial Jobless Claims remained steady at 232K last week, 1000 claims fewer than the previous week and remaining solidly within the long-term range of 225K-250K which is illustrative of a very strong (and continually tightening) labor market. Aside from dips below even these very robust figures a month or so ago, and spikes into higher jobless claims territory for a short time following last summer’s massive hurricanes, we have enjoyed an historically strong and steady U.S. employment situation for several years now. Continuing claims reached 1.863 million in the week, another very healthy sign.Q1 earnings results continue strong and steady, as well. While we’re not seeing any of the biggest companies on Wall Street reporting today, such as the FANG stocks (most of which start next week; Netflix posted positive surprises Monday), we do have a number of companies that have registered new figures, and almost all better than expected:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated W.W. Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report) posted a heft earnings beat, reporting $4.18 per share vs. $3.41 expected. Revenues also surpassed expectations, $2.77 billion vs. $2.71 billion in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised sales guidance for full-year 2018 from 3-7% previously to 5-8% today, to $14.30-15.30 per share. Shares, as a result, are trading up 7% in today’s pre-market. For more on GWW’s earnings, click here.Two Wall Street banks have also brought forth Q1 results: BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report) and Bank of New York-Mellon (BK  -  Free Report). Both Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated firms beat on both top and bottom lines, with BK posting the wider positive margins: $1.10 per share on $4.18 billion, ahead of the 97 cents and $4.05 billion anticipated, up 33% and 9% year over year, respectively. BBT beat by 5 cents on the bottom line to 97 cents per share on revenues that eked out expectations of $2.83 billion.For more on BBT’s earnings, click here.For more on BK’s earnings, click here.Among still others, tobacco major Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by posting an even $1.00 per share in the quarter, above the 88 cents expected and representing growth of 2% year over year. Yet revenues of $6,896 million fell beneath the Zacks consensus of $7,024 million, although year over year was still up 13.7%. Guidance is for full-year growth of 8-11%, higher.
"
140,BBT,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. The figure recorded 31.1% surge from the year-ago quarter.Results reflected a slight rise in revenues and lower operating expenses. However, higher credit costs and a decline in loan balance were the undermining factors.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $745 million or 94 cents per share, up from $378 million or 46 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Grow Slightly, Expenses DeclineTotal revenues (taxable-equivalent) came in at $2.84 billion, up marginally year over year. The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.83 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income increased slightly from the prior-year quarter to $1.66 billion. Net interest margin fell 2 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.44%.Non-interest income increased nearly 1% year over year to $1.18 billion. Higher investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, and bankcard fees and merchant discounts were partly offset by decline in insurance income and mortgage banking income.Non-interest expenses of $1.69 billion fell 19.8% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower outside IT services costs and net merger-related and restructuring charges as well as absence of loss on early extinguishment of debt.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.3%, down from 58.0% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates rise in profitability.As of Mar 31, 2018, total deposits were nearly $158.2 billion, up marginally from the prior quarter. Total loans and leases of $144.2 billion were down slightly on a sequential basis.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Mar 31, 2018, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $669 million, down 16.5% year over year. As a percentage of total assets, NPAs came in at 0.30%, down 6 bps.Further, net charge-offs were 0.41% of average loans and leases, down 1 bp year over year. However, allowance for loan and lease losses came in at 1.05% of total loans and leases held for investment, up 1 bp from the prior-year quarter.Also, provision for credit losses was $150 million at the end of the quarter, reflecting a 1.4% increase on a year-over-year basis.Strong Profitability & Capital RatiosAt the end of the reported quarter, return on average assets was 1.45%, up from 0.79% in the prior-year quarter. Return on average common equity improved to 11.43% from 5.72% as of Mar 31, 2017.As of Mar 31, 2018, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12%, on par with the year-ago quarter. BB&T's estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III was approximately 10.2% as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 10.3% as of Mar 31, 2017.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, BB&T repurchased $320 million worth shares through open-market purchases.Our TakeBB&T remains well positioned for revenue growth through strategic acquisitions. Also, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, is likely to propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead. However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability to some extent.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteBB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

142,BBT,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from improvement in revenues, stable adjusted expenses and lower provisions. However, a decline in loan and deposit balances was the undermining factor.SunTrust has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and matched in one, over the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.1%.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteHowever, the company’s activities in the first quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.11 remained unchanged over the last seveb days. Nevertheless, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 27.6%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.27 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects an improvement of 2.8% from the prior-year quarter.However, the company’s price performance has not been very impressive. Its shares have lost 3.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 8.9%.Will the price performance improve post first-quarter earnings release? Let’s check which factors are expected to impact SunTrust’s Q1 earnings.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings assets of $184.6 billion for the first quarter reflects an improvement of nearly 1% year over year. Moreover, the quarter witnessed a modest improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, to which the company has a high degree of exposure. Thus, given the loan growth and rising interest rates, NII is expected to improve in the quarter.Also, management expects first-quarter net interest margin to be up 0-2 basis points (bps).Relatively Stable Non-Interest Income: While overall mortgage servicing fees remained decent in the first quarter, production volumes slowed down. Thus, mortgage production income is expected to remain weak. Moreover, with the refinance boom nearing its end, this segment is not going to be much of a help and hence, SunTrust’s overall mortgage revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Coming to investment banking activities, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings, thereby having a positive impact on the related fees. However, the trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt issuance may reverse to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter, as rising rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in these activities. Thus, investment banking income is expected to remain muted in the quarter.Nevertheless, given the significantly high volatility experienced in the first quarter, particularly in the months of February and March, trading activities remained strong. This is expected to boost trading income for the company.Expenses to Decline Slightly: Driven by branch consolidation efforts, SunTrust’s expenses have been declining for the past few years. While the company expects core personnel expenses to increase approximately $75 million in the quarter due to the seasonal increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses, overall costs are expected to remain low.Now, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is -0.27%.Zacks Rank: SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Also, the figure represents a year-over-year jump of 30.8%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.01 billion for the quarter, reflecting 8.3% year-over-year growth.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayHigher fee revenues to lend support: Driven by the benefits of the acquired GE Asset Management business, State Street’s management fees are likely to improve. Further, management fees as well as servicing fees are anticipated to witness modest increase, driven by decent equity markets performance, new business wins and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar during the first quarter.Also, significant market volatility is expected support trading revenues. Specifically, foreign exchange trading revenues are likely to improve, given the higher foreign exchange trading volumes and increased volatility.Additionally, with the expansion in the spread between three-month LIBOR and the Fed funds rate, along with an increase in trading volumes, securities lending revenues are expected to trend higher during the quarter. Thus, State Street’s fee revenues are expected to rise in the to-be-reported quarter.Stable net interest income (NII): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $190.3 billion for the quarter represents a decline of 13.2% year over year. Nonetheless, overall lending activities were decent during the first quarter. This, along with higher interest rates will likely boost State Street’s NII. However, lower interest earning assets are likely to offset this gain to some extent.Modest rise in operating expenses: State Street expects operating expenses to rise slightly as compensation benefit expenses will be seasonally higher in the quarter owing to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation from retirement eligible employees as well as payroll taxes.Moreover, the expense level will also be dependent on the revenue backdrop in the quarter and the onboarding of new clients. Nonetheless, State Street Beacon expense savings will offset the rise to some extent during the first quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:State Street does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is -0.37%.Zacks Rank: State Street has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

144,BBT,"People's United Financial, Inc. (PBCT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the market opens. Both revenues and earnings are anticipated to improve year over year.Before we discuss the factors that could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.Driven by higher revenues and lower provisions, People's United reported a positive earnings surprise of 11.1% in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, elevated loans and deposits balances were tailwinds. However, escalating expenses was the undermining factor.Notably, People's United delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 4.87%. People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise People's United Financial, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | People's United Financial, Inc. QuoteRegarding the stock’s performance, shares of the company declined slightly for the three-month period ended Mar 31, 2018. Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to People's United stock? This depends largely on whether or not the firm is able to post a beat in the first quarter. Notably, our quantitative model does not conclusively predict likely earnings beat this time. Here’s why:Our proven model indicates that People's United does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for People's United is -0.27%.Zacks Rank: People's United carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged over the last seven days and is expected to move up 36.4% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $394 million, up 18.2% year over year.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsLoan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the quarter to be reported. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.In addition, management’s expectations of loan and deposit growth in 2018 will likely be reflected in this quarter. Management projects loan portfolio to grow in the range of 4-6%, while deposits are projected to be up 3-5%.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the influence of rise in interest rates, People's United is anticipated to have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of 2018 NII’s growth in the range of 10-12% is likely to show impact in the quarter to be reported as well. This is based on the expectation of net interest margin (NIM) in the range of 3.05-3.15%, on assumption of a 25-basis-point rate hike during the year.Fee Income to Escalate: On strong retail banking, fee income might escalate for the bank. Additionally, the company projects non-interest income to rise in the range of 3-5% in 2018, the impact of which is likely to be reflected in the first quarter.Increase in Expenses: Despite undertaking a number of expense-saving initiatives, People’s United’s operating expenses have witnessed an elevated level. Though the company is focused on optimizing its branch network and has initiated installation of technology to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, escalating expense levels are likely to curb bottom-line expansion.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is +0.21% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

Both revenues and earnings are estimated to rise year over year, with a likely earnings beat in the cards.Before we discuss why an earnings beat is likely and what could influence the results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last reported quarter.    This Birmingham, AL-based company’s fourth-quarter 2017 earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings as well. Easing margin pressure and higher revenues were the positive factors. Moreover, credit quality recorded significant improvement.

For the three-month period ended Mar 31, 2018, the stock gained around 7.5%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged at 31 cents over the last 60 days, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of nearly 34.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.44 billion indicates around 5% growth from the prior-year quarter.In addition, Regions is expected to record marginal rise, on a sequential basis, in average interest-earning assets as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $109.5 billion.Regions has an impressive earnings surprise history, as evident from the chart below: Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Regions Financial Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Regions Financial Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to Regions’ stock?

The bank projects average loans to be up in low-single digits on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impact of the third-party indirect-vehicle portfolio.Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Given the effect of rise in interest rates, Regions is expected to have recorded an increase in NII. Notably, management’s projections of the 2018 NII and other financing income to rise in the range of 3-5% are likely to show impact in the first quarter.Non Interest Income Might Escalate: The persistent decline in non-interest income has weighed on the top line for the last few years. Moreover, seasonally lower fee income might be experienced during the quarter. Nevertheless, adjusted non-interest income is estimated to improve 3-6% in 2018.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for capital market revenues is estimated to decline 23.7% sequentially to $42.7 million, while commercial credit fee income is projected to increase slightly to $18.3 million.Expenses Might Rise Slightly: Regions’ efficient expense management might decently support the bottom line during the quarter. Notably, the company is on track for a $400-million expense reduction by 2019. While investing in revenue-generating areas, the company intends to keep expenses stable. Notably, in the first quarter, seasonally higher personnel expenses are expected.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Earnings ESP for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is +0.21% and the stock carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

147,BBT,"After three consecutive quarters of witnessing muted activities, volatility is back in the market. This is expected to result in improvement in Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) trading revenues in first-quarter 2018. As trading revenues constitute an important part of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lead the company to report improved results on Apr 16.In the last two months of the first quarter, the markets experienced considerable volatility. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse. The trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility during the quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Markets segment (under which trading revenues are accounted for) revenues of $4.64 billion reflects a jump of 36.8% from the prior quarter.Here are the other factors that are likely influence BofA’s Q1 results:Steady improvement in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in an increase in net interest income (NII).Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $1.96 trillion for the first quarter indicates a marginal sequential improvement. This, along with decent lending activities and higher interest rates, is projected to further boost BofA’s NII in the quarter.Management expects NII, in the first quarter, to benefit from the rate hike in December 2017. This is expected to be partially offset by two less days in the quarter (lowering NII by $175 million) and seasonal decline in card loans. On an FTE basis, NII is anticipated to decline nearly $120 million owing to the tax act.Investment banking performance to be muted: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance may reverse to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter, as rising rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees account for a major portion of total investment banking fees for BofA, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.However, strong equity issuances globally are expected to have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for BofA. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely lead to a slight rise in advisory revenues for the company.For BofA, investment banking revenues are accounted in its Global Banking segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $5 billion reflects a marginal decline on a sequential basis.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this operation. Further, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter as mortgage rates continued to move upward. As BofA hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, the company is expected to witness muted growth in the same.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Consumer Banking segment (under which mortgage fees are accounted for) revenues of $8.91 billion shows a slight fall from the prior quarter.Reduced scope of cost control: Expense reduction, which has long been the main method to remain profitable, is not expected to be the primary support in the to-be reported quarter. Further, as BofA continues to digitize banking operations and upgrade technology, related costs are expected to rise.But given the success of BofA’s cost-saving efforts and other restructuring initiatives as well as absence of significant legal costs and provisions, overall operating expenses are likely to remain relatively stable.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:BofA does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BofA is -0.31%.Zacks Rank: BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Bank of America Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Bank of America Corporation QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 59 cents reflects 43.9% growth on a year-over-year basis.

148,BBT,"After three consecutive quarters of witnessing muted activities, volatility seems to be back in the market. The expected rise in JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) trading revenues in first-quarter 2018 indicates the same. As trading revenues constitute a major part of the bank’s top line, this is expected to lead the company to report improved results on Apr 13.In the last two months of the first quarter, the markets experienced significant volatility. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse. The trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation, tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited volatility during the quarter.At the annual Investors’ Day conference in late February, management projected first-quarter market revenues to rise mid to high single-digit rate on a year-over-year basis.Similar to the prior quarters, equity trading revenues are expected to render support to the total trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.85 billion reflects an increase of 15% from the year-ago quarter and 60.9% jump sequentially. Notably, per the consensus estimate, fixed income trading revenues will remain flat year over year but surge a whopping 91% from the prior quarter to $4.22 billion.Apart from this, here are the other factors that are anticipated to influence JPMorgan’s Q1 results:Steady increase in net interest income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — will likely result in higher net interest income (NII).Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $2.21 trillion for the first quarter indicates an increase of 2.3% year over year and 1% sequentially. This, along with decent lending activities and higher interest rates, is further projected to boost the company’s NII in the to-be-reported quarter.On a sequential basis, management expects NII to be slightly lower due to the impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and lower day count, partially offset by the benefits of higher rates and growth.Muted investment banking performance: The trend of pocketing solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance may reverse to some extent in the to-be-reported quarter, as rising rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees account for about half of total investment banking fees for JPMorgan, this is expected to have an adverse impact on investment banking revenues.However, strong equity issuances globally are expected to have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for JPMorgan. Also, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As in certain sectors will likely support the company in partially offsetting the lost revenues.Notably, the company expects investment banking income to remain stable or increase marginally year over year.Slowdown in mortgage banking: With the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment. Further, home equity loan portfolio is likely to decline in the to-be-reported quarter. As JPMorgan hasn’t bulked up its mortgage banking businesses since the last recession, the company is expected to witness muted growth in the same.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will not likely be a major support. Also, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact JPMorgan’s earnings unusually.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:JPMorgan does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for JPMorgan is -0.80%.Zacks Rank: JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

149,BBT,"Thursday, April 19, 2018Considering how many game-changing headlines we’ve seen so far in 2018 — from inflation/interest rate fears to geopolitical hornets nests to Washington DC soap operas — this has been a welcome week for the stock markets. Just think if we’d have had some seasonably appropriate weather — we’d be on Cloud 9 right now! And this relative calm in a sea of turbulence continues ahead of the opening bell this morning, with Initial Jobless Claims and new Q1 earnings results hitting the tape.Initial Jobless Claims remained steady at 232K last week, 1000 claims fewer than the previous week and remaining solidly within the long-term range of 225K-250K which is illustrative of a very strong (and continually tightening) labor market. Aside from dips below even these very robust figures a month or so ago, and spikes into higher jobless claims territory for a short time following last summer’s massive hurricanes, we have enjoyed an historically strong and steady U.S. employment situation for several years now. Continuing claims reached 1.863 million in the week, another very healthy sign.Q1 earnings results continue strong and steady, as well. While we’re not seeing any of the biggest companies on Wall Street reporting today, such as the FANG stocks (most of which start next week; Netflix posted positive surprises Monday), we do have a number of companies that have registered new figures, and almost all better than expected:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated W.W. Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report) posted a heft earnings beat, reporting $4.18 per share vs. $3.41 expected. Revenues also surpassed expectations, $2.77 billion vs. $2.71 billion in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised sales guidance for full-year 2018 from 3-7% previously to 5-8% today, to $14.30-15.30 per share. Shares, as a result, are trading up 7% in today’s pre-market. For more on GWW’s earnings, click here.Two Wall Street banks have also brought forth Q1 results: BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report) and Bank of New York-Mellon (BK  -  Free Report). Both Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-rated firms beat on both top and bottom lines, with BK posting the wider positive margins: $1.10 per share on $4.18 billion, ahead of the 97 cents and $4.05 billion anticipated, up 33% and 9% year over year, respectively. BBT beat by 5 cents on the bottom line to 97 cents per share on revenues that eked out expectations of $2.83 billion.For more on BBT’s earnings, click here.For more on BK’s earnings, click here.Among still others, tobacco major Philip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates by posting an even $1.00 per share in the quarter, above the 88 cents expected and representing growth of 2% year over year. Yet revenues of $6,896 million fell beneath the Zacks consensus of $7,024 million, although year over year was still up 13.7%. Guidance is for full-year growth of 8-11%, higher than previously expected. For more on PM’s earnings, click here.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

150,BBT,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Apr 13.The expected rebound in Citigroup’s trading revenues will likely have a positive impact on first-quarter 2018 earnings given the significant dependence of its top line on this source. Further, benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly consumer banking — are anticipated to offset the negatives.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter.Therefore, after three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues.Per John Gerspach, chief financial officer (CFO) of Citigroup, rising volatility at the very beginning of 2018 is expected to break the trading revenues’ slump. The bank expects first-quarter 2018 trading revenues to be up by a ""low-to-mid"" single digit on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, equities business is likely to record revenues of more than $1 billion in Q1, last recorded in 2015. However, management believes investment banking might go down as compared with the prior-year quarter.Other Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsConsumer Banking Revenues to Exhibit Growth: In consumer, management expects continued modest year-over-year revenue growth, and positive operating leverage in both North America and International Consumer in 2018. In total, sequential growth in pre-tax earnings in Global Consumer banking was recorded over the last three quarters and is anticipated to continue into the first quarter as well.Acceleration in growth for overall Latin America Consumer revenues is expected in 2018 on rising card revenues.Investment Banking Fees to Decline: The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could impact revenues of Citigroup.However, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As will likely help banks to partially offset the lost revenues. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase. Thus, Citigroup is also likely to report a decent quarter.On the institutional side, continued year-over-year revenue growth in accrual businesses, including TTS, the Private Bank, Corporate Lending and Securities Services are anticipated.Lesser scope of cost containment: As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction might not be a major support. Nonetheless, some legal settlements during the quarter might impact Citigroup’s earnings to an extent.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might perk up interest income.Credit Costs Might Impact Negatively: Cost of credit is likely to rise, quarter on quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in ICG, offset by lower reserve builds in consumer. Net credit-card losses are likely to worsen. Citigroup expects NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points (bps) for 2018 and up to 325 bps over the medium term. In retail services, NCL rate is projected in the range of 500 bps for 2018 and up to 525 bps over the medium term.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Citigroup does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Citigroup is -0.74%.

But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.62 reflects a 19.12% rise on a year-over-year basis.

151,BBT,"Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 20. The company has a woeful earnings history, with consecutive colossal earnings misses. Last quarter, the company missed estimates for the eighth consecutive quarter, recording a massive negative surprise of 450%. Ericsson witnessed an average negative surprise of 552.5% for the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether Ericsson is set to witness yet another earnings miss.Factors to ConsiderThe information and communications technology solutions provider is grappling with shrinking markets and stiff competition from other established players in the market. Moreover, slowdown in spending by wireless carriers severely hurt the company’s financials over the past few quarters and is likely to affect the upcoming results.Most of the company’s troubles have stemmed from the drying up of investments by major telecom equipment makers across the world. The company’s revenues and margins in the Networks and IT & Cloud segments continue to take a beating from adverse industry trends.Further, Ericsson foresees sustained weakness in the market for radio access networks. Network equipment sales, particularly in North America and Europe, continue to contract. Europe and Latin America — the markets with the biggest impact — are likely to have an increasingly challenging investment environment in the quarters to come.Soft mobile broadband demand and slowdown in emerging markets will continue to put a significant dent in Ericsson’s performance. These factors will likely manifest in the company’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite these challenges, Ericsson remains the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology, with significant market share and a large number of LTE networks worldwide. The company envisions healthy traction in its 4G portfolio and 5G readinesses. At the same time, Ericsson is continuing with steady investment in R&D, technology leadership and gross margin improvement. The company is trimming its workforce to reduce operating costs and improve bottom line.Ericsson is seeking to seize business opportunities as operators shift toward 4G deployments and prepare ground for the forthcoming 5G revolution. The company plans to focus more intently on software sales and recurring business that complements its thriving Professional Services business in terms of “targeted growth” investments. Ericsson expects to be better-equipped to address the varied needs of its customer segments and tap new markets to foster growth.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Ericsson is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% with both pegged at a loss of 3 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Ericsson Price and EPS Surprise  Ericsson Price and EPS Surprise | Ericsson QuoteZacks Rank: Ericcson has a Zacks Rank #3. Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to make us confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:American Airlines Group Inc.

152,BBT,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 18, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Benefits of higher rates, improved lending scenario and rebound in trading activities are anticipated to offset muted investment banking performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $5.5 billion reflects a rise of 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.U.S. Bancorp’s fourth-quarter 2017 results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. Also, a strong capital position and increasing loans were the positives. However, higher expenses and lower mortgage banking revenues were the key headwinds.Notably, the company displays a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 1.2%. U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp will likely beat on earnings in the first quarter. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for a possible earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for U.S. Bancorp is +0.96%.Zacks Rank: U.S. Bancorp carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Though estimates for the to-be-reported quarter have remained stable over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 94 cents reflects growth of 14.6% year over year.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsRise in net interest income (NII): Improvement in loan demand, particularly in commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer areas, along with and rising interest rates during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII. Also, income from interest earning assets (average balance) are projected to rise 4.5% to $417.2 billion.Non-Interest Income Likely to Improve:  Strong equity issuances along with a potential rise in fees from increasing M&A’s are likely to have supported U.S. Bancorp’s fee income. Per the consensus estimate, trust and investment management fees are likely to improve 8.1% to $398 million on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to boost the bank’s credit and debit card revenues by 4.8% from year-ago quarter to $306 million.Nevertheless, with the slowdown in refinancing activities caused by rising interest rates, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment. The consensus estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $197 billion, down 4.8% year over year.Expenses Might Trend Higher: Increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings and seasonally higher compensation expenses might escalate costs moderately.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BOK Financial Corporation (BOKF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.78% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

153,BBT,"Earnings season for banks has already begun and the results released so far by the big names reflect a decent performance. The results till now indicate higher revenues supported by improved loan balances, hike in interest rates and rebound in trading activities. However, lower mortgage income and dismal investment banking performance adversely impacted fee income to some extent.On the cost front, the chance of a significant rise in expenses is low, though a marginal increase in expenses is expected to occur owing to efforts to digitize operations and investment in franchise. Notably, lower tax rates are projected to boost earnings.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in the first quarter are projected to jump 19.2% year over year. This compares favorably with prior quarter’s earnings growth of 2.7%.Therefore, this seems to be the right time to add a few bank stocks in case they beat earnings estimates.Let’s check the factors that are likely to influence the following major banks slated to report first-quarter results on Apr 19, before the opening bell.KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) earnings and revenues are expected to improve in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 38 cents, reflecting year-over-year increase of 18.8%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.56 billion indicates 4.1% growth from the prior-year quarter.Driven by loan growth and higher interest rates, the bank’s interest income will likely increase. The consensus estimate for net interest income (NII) (tax equivalent basis) of $948 million for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 2% increase on a year-over-year basis.On the other hand, fee income growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is likely to be muted due to expectations of lower mortgage banking fees, trust and investment services income, and investment banking fees. (Read more: Will Loan Growth, Lower Costs Aid KeyCorp Q1 Earnings?)KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise  KeyCorp Price and EPS Surprise | KeyCorp QuoteAnother major bank, BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is expected to report a marginal decline in NII owing to lower net interest margin expectation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.62 billion for the to-be-reported quarter shows 1.6% decline on a sequential basis.Fee income performance is likely to be disappointing as well with rise in insurance fees providing some relief. Total non-interest income is projected to witness a 2.4% fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is $1.20 billion. (Read more: Can Loan Growth & Insurance Fees Aid BB&T Q1 Earnings?)Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 92 cents, which reflects year-over-year rise of 24.3%.

(Read more: Why is an Earnings Beat Likely for BNY Mellon in Q1?)For this Zacks Rank #3 stock, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 97 cents reflects year-over-year growth of 21.3%.

154,BBT,"Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, before the opening bell on Apr 13.This San Francisco-based banking giant has been in the news on a regular basis, following the sales scam that surfaced in September 2016. The revelation of the fake account scandal that marked the beginning of numerous problems for the bank was followed by the disclosure of issues in the bank’s auto insurance business and online bill pay services.Therefore, the bank has been subjected to severe political and public outrage, and faced several lawsuits and investigations as well.To add to the woes, during the first quarter, the Federal Reserve ordered the bank to replace four board directors and also not increase its assets position beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017). The Fed’s action demonstrates poor governance, compliance and risk management of Wells Fargo associated with the sales practices scandal, as well as mishandling of auto-insurance and mortgage fees.Notably, the firm is restricted from growth until governance and risk management improve. However, the bank is allowed to continue with current banking activities.Mortgage business, the primary source of revenue for Wells Fargo, is expected to witness a slowdown in the first quarter. With the interest rates moving higher, refinancing activities have been slowing down. Therefore, no major help is expected from this segment. Thus, growth in Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenues is expected to be low.Here are the other factors influencing Wells Fargo’s Q1 results:Loan Growth: Per the Fed’s latest data, loans are expected to improve slightly on a sequential basis during the to-be-reported quarter. Particularly, weakness in revolving home equity loans might offset growth in commercial and industrial (C&I), consumer and overall real estate loans to some extent.However, the auto portfolio run-off is likely to continue into the near term on tightening of underwriting standards by Wells Fargo. Also, the bank is cutting back its auto-lending business amid stressful markets and adherence of more centralized risk controls.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, management expects loan growth to be impacted by seasonally lower mortgage origination and credit card balances. Additionally, based on the current pricing trends and channel mix in held-for-sale pipeline, the gain on sale margin is expected to decline.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending might perk up interest income.Expenses May Trend Higher: Wells Fargo might record escalated costs given its franchise investments in areas, including mobile banking technology, digital lending and brokerage offerings. Moreover, high legal costs might be witnessed due to ongoing litigation hassles.Non-Interest Revenues to Grow Modestly: Outflows from the asset-management business will likely be recorded on market declines. However, driven by high volatility, trading activity is expected to improve marginally in the quarter and rise in trust income is anticipated on higher equity markets.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Wells Fargo beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate are high as it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +0.73%. This is a very significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of Wells Fargo’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings remained stable over the last seven days and is expected to be up 7% year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected at $21.7 billion, down 1.5% year over year. Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise Wells Fargo & Company Price and EPS Surprise | Wells Fargo & Company QuoteOther Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 18.

155,BBT,"KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), slated to announce first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, is expected to show improvement in net interest income (NII), driven by higher interest rates. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans recorded solid growth year over year, even though the quarter witnessed a modest improvement in lending activities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average total loans of $87.2 billion for the first quarter indicates year-over-year growth of 1.3%. Driven by loan growth, earning assets are also likely to rise. The consensus estimate for average interest earning assets of $123.4 billion for the to-be-reported quarter indicates an increase of 3.1%.Thus, KeyCorp’s NII, one of the main revenue sources, is expected to support earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (tax equivalent basis) of $948 million for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 2% increase on a year-over-year basis.Let’s check out other factors that are expected to influence KeyCorp’s Q1 performance:Muted non-interest income growth: KeyCorp’s first-quarter non-interest income will benefit from rise in service charge on deposits as deposit balance is expected to improve in the quarter.However, given lower debt placement activities, investment banking fees are expected to fall. Also, as equity market performance was dismal during the quarter, trust and investment services income is expected to witness a decline.Further, due to lower mortgage originations, growth in mortgage banking fees will likely be muted during the quarter. Therefore, non-interest income growth is expected to be disappointing.Notably, management expects fee income to decline sequentially, given the seasonality in loan fees and corporate-owned life insurance as well as normalized levels of investment banking and debt placement fees.Fall in expenses to lend support: KeyCorp has been diversifying products, reorganizing operations and exiting unprofitable/non-core businesses. Thus, the company’s overall non-interest expenses (excluding merger-related charges) are expected to be manageable.Also, management will be realizing the majority of remaining $50 million cost savings from the Fist Niagara deal in the first quarter. In fact, KeyCorp anticipates operating expenses to decline sequentially.Asset quality to aid results: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing asset of $402 million indicates a plunge of 35.5% year over year. Likewise, the consensus estimate for non-performing loans of $339 million, reflects a decrease of 40.8% from the year-ago quarter.As KeyCorp is likely to witness a rise in loans, a corresponding increase in provision for loan losses is expected. But overall, this is expected to be manageable.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of KeyCorp beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for KeyCorp is -0.95%.Zacks Rank: KeyCorp carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

156,BBT,"The rebound in trading business is likely to drive Goldman Sachs’ (GS  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings, to be reported on Apr 17. Moreover, benefits of higher rates and relatively better performance of other segments — mainly investing and lending — are anticipated to aid earnings.Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. After three straight quarters of muted activities, it appears that volatility is back in the markets, with extremity in February and March. This indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues.Notably, the quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, which pulled the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields down. This reversed the uptrend experienced by banks since last September. Moreover, Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector affected the stock market rally in the quarter.Reversing the trend of the last couple of quarters, higher trading revenues are expected in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Institutional Client Services division, of which the major portion comprises fixed income revenues, reflects a rise of 19.2% sequentially.In additionally, investment management unit of Goldman is projected to aid earnings as increase in investments in fixed income, alternatives and low-cost index funds are expected to escalate management and other fees. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the division projects a rise of 12.4% year over year.Here are the other factors that might influence Goldman’s Q1 results:Investment Banking Fees to Report Modest Results: The trend of earning solid advisory and underwriting fees for debt and equity issuance might reverse in the first quarter, as rising rates will limit corporates’ involvement in these activities. As debt origination fees typically account for about half of total investment banking fees, this could impact revenues of Goldman.However, a potential rise in fees from increasing M&As will likely help banks partially offset the lost revenues. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are predicted to increase. Thus, Goldman is also likely to report a decent quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment banking segment is projected at $1.8 billion, up 12.5% year over year.Investing & Lending to Get a Boost: Higher asset values, improved corporate performance and rising rates are expected to aid revenues from this source. In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer — might perk up revenues. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investing and lending segment is projected at $1.6 billion, up 23.1% year over year.Strong Expense Management: Goldman is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. As the majority of unnecessary expenses have already been cut by the bank, expense reduction will unlikely be a major support. Furthermore, there were no major outflows related to legal settlements during the quarter that might impact Goldman’s earnings unusually.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Goldman does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Goldman carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $5.67 reflects a 10.1% rise on a year-over-year basis. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $8.9 billion indicates 10.7% increase from the prior-year quarter. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

157,BBT,"The employees at the brokerage division of Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) are being investigated for any possible customer abuses made by them. Recently, William Galvin, the top securities regulator of Massachusetts announced that his office has started investigating the wealth management arm of Well Fargo to see if the division has been steering rollover money into managed accounts or if its employees have been making investment recommendations that are unsuitable for its clients’ needs.This investigation comes almost a week after Wells Fargo, in its 10K filing, revealed that it was conducting an internal review to assess whether there had been unjustified referrals or recommendations, with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank’s investment and fiduciary services business.Wells Fargo had agreed to do a detailed investigation, only after facing probes from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require.The bank did find that in some cases customers were overcharged in connection with certain assets and accounts. There have been issues with incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets.However, Wells Fargo has not yet determined the number of accounts that were affected, along with the reasons that led to the wrongdoings.Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for the bank’s brokerage division, recently stated that the bank has made ""significant progress in our work to identify and fix any issues, make things right and build a better, stronger company.""Thus, Galvin said that his office was seeking information about the scope of Wells Fargo’s investigation. They have asked the bank to give them information regarding “inappropriate referrals of brokerage customers to managed and advisory accounts, unsuitable recommendations of alternative investments, as well as unsuitable referrals and recommendations in connection with 401(k) rollovers.”Galvin mentioned, “Given the recent retirement savings crisis in America, referrals and recommendations involving 401(k) accounts should be closely scrutinized, in light of the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule.”Troubles started for Wells Fargo since September 2016 when its employees, seeking to hit sales targets, opened millions of unauthorized accounts for its customers without their prior permission. To settle the case, the bank had agreed to pay $190 million to the federal and state regulators.Galvin said in a statement, ""Wells Fargo's recent banking scandal, which involved opening bogus accounts for their customers, leads me to believe that where there is smoke, there's fire. I need to be assured that Massachusetts residents haven't been burned by corporate greed.""We believe that while these legal expenses are likely to hurt Wells Fargo’s bottom-line growth, its consistent growth in loans and deposits, lower tax rate and expansions will likely support its growth profile.Shares of the company gained 12% in the past six months, underperforming 20.6% growth of its industry.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc.

158,BBT,"Kelly Stuart King, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), received a total of $12.67 million as annual compensation for 2017. The payout amount, disclosed by the bank in a regulatory filing, reflects a 9.1% rise on a year-over-year basis.King’s base salary for the year remained unchanged at $1.075 million. Thus, the rise in his total compensation was through stock grants.This is because, in February 2017, the company’s board of directors made changes in executive compensation scheme, wherein it was decided that the base salary of the company’s top 4 executives will remain unchanged for 2017 and any increase in compensation will, hence, be given through stock awards.Thus, the 2017 base salary of Christopher L. Henson, BB&T’s president and chief operating officer (COO) also remained unchanged at $700,000. The stock awards granted to him for the year were increased to $1.5 million from $863,971 in 2016, raising his total compensation for 2017 by 24.6% to $7.19 million.Among other finance companies, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) also increased their CEO’s compensation.Notably, the compensation hikes for BB&T comes after the company delivered strong fourth-quarter as well as full-year 2017 results. Higher rates and loan growth drove the company’s revenues, which aided earnings growth to quite an extent.While higher expenses might hurt BB&T’s bottom-line growth to some extent, the company’s continuous expansion via acquisitions and lower tax rates are likely to aid profitability in the quarters ahead.In fact, with an aim to pass on the benefits from the tax reforms to the shareholders, BB&T also announced a 13.6% dividend hike and a one-time dividend of 4.5 cents per share. This, along with other capital deployment activities, is expected to continue boosting shareholder confidence in the stock.Shares of the company gained 5.8% in 2017, underperforming the 18.9% rally of the industry.BB&T currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

159,BBT,"Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) exhibits mixed prospects for revenue growth, but cost-saving initiatives are expected to support bottom-line growth. However, litigation issues remain a concern.Expense management and streamlining operations internationally aided the company to surge 23% over the past year compared with 15% growth registered by the industry.Moreover, the company’s earnings estimates have been revised slightly upward, for the current year, over the last 30 days. As a result, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Citigroup has been emphasizing on growth in core businesses. Further, the company continues to optimize its branch network, with focus on core urban markets, improving digital channels and reducing branches. It is also making investment in several areas to stoke growth. Additionally, the ongoing investments in branded cards support the company’s growth strategy.The company’s operating expenses witnessed a negative CAGR of 9.2% over four years (2014-2017). Expenses dropped as the impact of higher volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were more than offset by efficiency savings and wind-down of legacy assets. Though revenues remained volatile over the past few years, the company recorded 2% year-over-year improvement in 2017. We expect the bank to record significant growth in revenues in the near term, backed by continued economic recovery and focus on core operations with strategic actions. Notably, for 2018, management projects top-line growth at around 3%, with stronger growth in operating businesses being offset by the persistent wind down of legacy assets.Stocks to ConsiderComerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

160,BBT,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the market opens. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans recorded solid growth on a sequential basis, though the quarter witnessed an overall modest improvement in lending activities.In fact, BB&T expects total average loans, on an annualized basis, to grow 1-3% sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter. Driven by loan growth, earning assets are likely to rise too. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $1.96 trillion for the first quarter indicates an increase of 1.5% sequentially.Nonetheless, despite a higher rate environment, management expects GAAP net interest margin (NIM) to be down 1-3 basis points (bps) on a sequential basis. Notably, core NIM is expected to be stable, attributable to the adjustment on tax exempt assets from the new corporate tax rate change.Thus, BB&T’s net interest income (NII), one of the primary sources of revenues, is not likely to aid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.62 billion for the to-be-reported quarter reflects 1.6% decline on a sequential basis.Now, let’s check out other factors that are likely to influence BB&T’s Q1 performance:Dismal fee income performance: Refinancing boom is nearing its end and higher interest rates are leading to a decline in mortgage originations. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of $94 million reflects a fall of 9.6% sequentially.Also, despite rising deposit balances, the company is not expected to register an increase in service charge on deposits. Notably, the consensus estimate for service charge on deposits is $173 million, down 5.5% from the prior quarter.However, BB&T is expected to register higher insurance income in the to-be-reported quarter. The consensus estimate for insurance fees of $462 million reflects 10.5% increase from the prior quarter.Overall, total non-interest income is projected to witness a 2.4% fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.20 billion.Stable expenses: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses in the first quarter to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.Asset quality is not of much support: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in addition to providing for loan growth. Further, management expects NCOs rates to increase sequentially and be in the range of 35-45 bps on the assumption of no deterioration in the economy.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing assets of $634 million for the to-be-reported quarter shows 1.1% increase on a sequential basis.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of BB&T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BB&T is +1.63%.Zacks Rank: BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3.BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is 92 cents, which reflects year-over-year improvement of 24.3%.

161,BBT,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings were in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher net interest revenues and assets under management (AUM) growth were offset by lower fee income and rise in expenses.BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings did not lag the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. The average positive surprise was 3.7%.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the first quarter were not adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents has remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects year-over-year growth of 21.3%.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4.05 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting an improvement of 6.4% year over year.BNY Mellon’s shares have gained 10.8% in the past year, underperforming the 17.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company will be able to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +0.21%.Zacks Rank: BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsImprovement in Fee Revenues: Given that the equity markets have performed decently during the first quarter, BNY Mellon’s asset servicing fees, as well as investment management and performance fees, are expected to witness modest improvement. Moreover, with the expansion in the spread between three-month LIBOR and the Fed funds rate, along with an increase in trading volumes, securities lending revenues are also expected to improve during the quarter.Further, driven by higher foreign exchange trading volumes and increased volatility, foreign exchange trading revenues are also likely to witness improvement. Thus, with the expected rise in the above-mentioned components, overall fee revenues must improve during the quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee revenues of $3.16 billion reflects 5.1% year-over-year improvement.Higher Rates to Boost Net Interest Revenues (NIR): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $296.8 billion reflects an improvement of 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the quarter has witnessed a moderate improvement in the lending scenario, primarily due to rise in consumer confidence and increase in loan demand to some extent, owing to the tax reform. Thus, given the improvement in loan balances, along with the effect of rising interest rates, BNY Mellon should register an increase in NIR.Moreover, management believes, any rate hike will lead to an improvement in margin. Hence, improving margins, due to the increase in rates, is likely to more than offset the reduced size of balance sheet and hence lead to a modest increase in NIR in the quarter.Expenses to Decline Slightly: Supported by the cost-saving initiatives, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been declining for the past few years. Moreover, despite the impact of investment-related expenses, overall costs are expected to remain low in the quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Associated Banc-Corp (ASB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 19.

162,BBT,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in revenues, rise in assets under management (AUM) and long-term inflows.Moreover, the company boasts a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 3.1%.BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | BlackRock, Inc. QuoteHowever, BlackRock’s business activities and prospects did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.44 has decreased marginally over the last 30 days. Nonetheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 22.7%.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the quarter is $3.28 billion, which reflects growth of 16.1% year over year.Strong fundamentals helped shares of the company to gain 35.7% in the past year, outperforming 14.4% growth of the industry.Will the rally in share price continue post Q1 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q1 results, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, it is likely that BlackRock will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. This is because, it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.07%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the odds of an earnings beat.Factors to Impact Q1 ResultsBlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market, given its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the to-be-reported quarter. In fact, the company expects to witness positive active equity flows during the quarter as well. Thus, driven by steady inflows, AUM is likely to witness improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.49 trillion, which reflects rise of 3.3%, sequentially.While higher AUM is expected to have a positive impact on investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, this effect is likely to be slightly offset by the muted market performance that was witnessed during the quarter. Thus, the investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 80% of the company’s total revenues, are likely to witness only a marginal improvement in the quarter.However, performance fees, which is another major revenue component is not expected to improve during the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fees for the first quarter is $65 million, which represents decline of 77.2% from the prior quarter.Notably, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, the restructuring of the traditional actively managed equities business, along with its plans for improving product offerings, is expected to lead to a further rise in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

164,BBT,"The financial sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. After President Donald Trump passed the tax reform last year, analysts are highly optimistic about the financial sector’s performance owing to recent trends in the sector.The Senate recently passed the deregulation bill, scaling back Dodd Frank. This is expected to be a huge positive for regional banks. Moreover, the current market sentiment around rate hikes by the Fed is expected to play in favor of the overall financial sector.Cause for AppealIn a landmark victory for Trump, the Senate passed a massive banking deregulation bill. In a rare showing of bipartisanship, the Senate voted 67 to 31 in favor of the bill, intended to help small banks become more competitive. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets would be exempted from the Volcker Rule, which prohibits federally insured institutions from trading for their own profits and also puts regulatory measures in place to limit their ownership of risky investments.Although some hurdles still remain, as the House may seek a more expansive rollback of the Dodd-Frank act, the bill is widely expected to become law. Moreover, although the regional banking sector celebrated this event, skeptics have warned of dire consequences in case it becomes law (read: Time for Top Bank ETFs Ahead of Powell's First Fed Meeting?).Further, driving positive sentiment for the overall financial sector is the current scenario around interest rates. Traders place a 94.4% probability around a rate hike in Jerome Powell’s first FOMC meeting, per the CME Fedwatch tool. Moreover, the debate on if the Fed will go ahead with three rate hikes or four in 2018 is still doing the rounds. Rate hikes are particularly positive for financial stocks, as it leads to an increase in the prime rates, at which banks lend to customers.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the space.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks in the U.S. equity markets.

165,BBT,"Joseph L. Hooley, chairman and CEO of State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report), received $16 million as total compensation for 2017, according to a proxy filing. While the amount marks a 26% rise from his pay in 2016, it is also the highest that Hooley has ever earned since becoming CEO in 2010.Per the securities filing, the $16 million includes his salary, stock awards and other incentives. However, it does not include a change in the value of his pension and certain other deferred compensation earnings.Of the total amount that Hooley received, $4.8 million was in the form of non-equity incentive, up from $2.6 million received in 2016. Also, $10.5 million was earned through the exercise and vesting of previously-issued stock options and awards.Some of the other perks that Hooley received as CEO were $37,993 for a car and driver, and $10,000 for home security, per the filing.Notably, as mentioned in the filing, the median compensation of workers of State Street was $82,760. If the change in the value of Hooley’s pension and other deferred compensation earnings are included, his compensation will be 236 times higher than the pay of the median State Street worker.However, as announced by the company, Hooley, who will continue as State Street chairman in 2019, is expected to retire as CEO by the end of this year. Ron O’Hanley, head of the company’s asset management unit will be taking over Hooley’s position as CEO.In the filing, Hooley’s pay package was justified by the fact that, till now, the company has been performing well under his reign and thus, his compensation is well deserved.

166,BBT,"The American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) is likely to get a breather from the senate’s recent decision to bring in a few amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. Regulations and policies extensively control the company, TRS and its U.S. bank subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (American Express Bank).The Dodd-Frank Reform was put in place by President Obama in 2010 to prevent the reccurence of the 2008 financial crisis.Amendment to the ActOne of the main tenet of the senate’s banking bill is to raise the minimium threshold bar for institutions that are deemed too big to fail to $250 billion  from $50 billion. This change would bring a relive to the small institutions and will result in a reduction in the number of banking institutions considered “too big to fail.” Further, it frees banks with less than $10 billion total assets from the Volcker rule. This rule was made to prevent banks from placing bets with their own money.Some of the beneficiaries of change are BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) among others.American Express to Gain from the MoveIf the proposed changes see the light of the day, American Express will no longer have to undergo the annual stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. These tests are designed to evaluate whether the company in question has sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis to recuperate losses and support operations under adverse economic conditions.The company is now required to maintain capital ratios appreciably above the applicable minimum requirements and buffers. It is also restricted in its ability to make any capital distributions (including dividend and share buy backs). A relaxation of this rule will provide the company increased financial flexibility and greater autonomy in capital allocation.We believe the company will be able to divert buffer capital for business expansion and enhance products.Strong Economy Another BoonLow unemployment, strong consumer confidence and reduction in tax rates bodes well for the company’s business which is directly dependent on consumer spending. The company has witnessed an increase in top line, thanks to increased spending.Lower Tax Rate to Benefit American ExpressA lower tax rate from the tax reform has enabled the company to plan to invest up to $200 million in 2018, for growth. For shareholders, the company expects to use the anticipated benefits to build capital and drive earnings in 2018.The operating environment looks favorable for American Express which in the recent past suffered from loss of one of its biggest client Costco Wholesale Corp. The company thereafter undertook massive growth initiatives which included increased marketing and advertising, higher customer rewards, and investment in customer-facing activities increased frills on cards etc. to woo and retain customers.The tearing away of the stiff capital regulations will further provide an impetus to its business.Shares of the company have gained around 21% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 5% rally.American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

167,BBT,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, slated for Wednesday, Apr 18, are likely to witness a rebound in trading income, one of the major revenue components. This will have a positive impact on its earnings, which is expected to be slightly hit by muted investment banking performance.After three consecutive quarters of muted activities, the markets witnessed significant volatility and revival of client activities in the last two months of the first quarter. In fact, February was one of the most volatile months since 2008, and March 2018 was even worse.Last year, trading activities remained weak despite several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and absence of significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration. Subdued inflation in the United States and modest rise in long-term interest rates were concerns. These factors resulted in lower fixed income trading while equity trading didn’t fare better either.Nonetheless, concerns over trade war between the United States and China, higher inflation expectation in the United States, further tightening of monetary policy by the Fed and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector incited significant volatility during the first quarter.Notably, equity trading revenues are expected to witness substantial growth in the to-be-reported quarter compared with fixed income trading revenues as Morgan Stanley had divested fixed income trading operations over the last few years.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $2.14 billion reflects a rise of 6% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.70 billion indicates a decline of nearly 1% from the prior-year quarter.Overall, first-quarter trading revenues are expected to be $3.78 billion, up 8.2% year over year.Here are the other factors that are expected to influence Morgan Stanley’s first-quarter results:Modest rise in net interest income (NII): Rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income. Also, overall loan demand was decent — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial and real estate. So, NII is anticipated to witness a modest improvement.A slight fall in underwriting fees: Unlike prior quarters, growth in underwriting fees, consisting of debt and equity underwriting, is expected to be muted. Rising interest rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuances. As debt origination fees account for more than 50% of total underwriting fees for Morgan Stanley, this will likely have an adverse impact on overall underwriting fees. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $520 million reflects a year-over-year fall of 2.1%.Further, high volatility in the equity markets across the globe is expected to have somewhat slowed down equity issuances. While fourth-quarter 2017 was an exception, IPOs and follow-on offerings in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to be modest. Thus, equity underwriting fees are anticipated to remain stable or improve marginally. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $381 million reflects a decrease of 2.3% from the prior-year quarter.All in all, total underwriting fees are projected to witness a 2.1% year-over-year decline as the consensus estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $901 million.Advisory fees to show weakness: M&A activity in terms of deals closed globally witnessed a fall in the first quarter, though the overall deal value recorded a significant rise. Thus, as number of deals declined, advisory fees are expected to be adversely impacted to some extent. So, Morgan Stanley is not likely to remain untouched. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $476 million, down 4% year over year.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Nevertheless, as revenues are expected to rise, compensation expenses will likely witness a slight increase.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:We cannot conclusively predict an earnings beat for Morgan Stanley this time. This is because the stock does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise  Morgan Stanley Price and EPS Surprise | Morgan Stanley QuoteNotably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.28 cents reflects a 28% jump on a year-over-year basis. Also, the consensus estimate for sales of $10.5 billion indicates 7.2% growth from the prior-year quarter.Stocks Worth ConsideringHere are a few bank stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 17.

168,BBT,"The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 19. While the company’s asset under management (AUM) growth is expected to remain strong in the quarter, its revenues and earnings are projected to decline on a year-over-year basis.Last quarter, the company’s economic net income surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and growth in AUM were partially offset by rise in expenses.Notably, Blackstone boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 10.2%.The Blackstone Group L.P. Price and EPS Surprise  The Blackstone Group L.P. Price and EPS Surprise | The Blackstone Group L.P. QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the first quarter failed to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 76 cents remained unchanged over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects a year-over-year decline of 7.3%.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.69 billion for the quarter also reflects a decline of 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.Also, the company’s price performance does not seem very impressive. Its shares have gained only 5% in the past year, underperforming the 14.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings release? Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Blackstone will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Blackstone is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Blackstone has a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsDriven by net inflows, the company’s fee-earning AUM and total AUM have been witnessing consistent growth since the past few years. In fact, with improvement in the overall economic scenario, Blackstone’s fund-raising ability is likely to continue aiding the uptrend in its fee-earning AUM and total AUM in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee-earning AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $341 billion, which reflects an improvement of 1.8% sequentially. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM of $450 billion depicts 3.7% growth from the prior quarter and 22.3% growth year over year.Given the growth in assets, the company’s performance fee is also expected to be positively impacted in the quarter.However, because of rise in compensation and benefit costs, the company’s overall expenses have remained elevated in the past few years. Moreover, as its well-performing funds require more headcount, expenses are likely to increase further during the quarter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

169,BBT,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 16, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to improve from the year-ago quarter.The bank’s bottom line is expected to benefit from lower tax rates as it is likely to have retained a remarkable part of its revenues. Also, improvements in the lending scenario and a rise in consumer confidence were some other positives. Further, heightened volatility during the quarter due to U.S.-China trade war tensions is expected to have boosted the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $1.42 billion indicates a 4.5% year-over-year improvement.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.M&T Bank’s fourth-quarter 2017 results were supported by higher revenues along with lower provisions for credit losses. The company also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to these factors. However, rise in expenses was a negative.The bank delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.8%.Over the past year, shares of M&T Bank have gained 27.3%, outperforming 22.1% growth recorded by the industry.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to M&T Bank’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Why a Positive Surprise is LikelyAccording to our quantitative model, chances of M&T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is +0.15%.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Notably, per the consensus estimate, M&T Bank’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 27.4% from the prior-year quarter to $2.74.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in the lending scenario primarily due to rise in consumer confidence and increase in loan demand to some extent, owing to the tax reform. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates are likely to boost M&T Bank’s NII.Relatively Stable Fee Income: The first quarter was exceptionally good for trading activities due to increased volatility, thanks to escalated tariff tensions between the United States and China, rise in prices of necessities and a sharp sell-off in the tech sector. Further, rise in advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher M&A activities and equity issuances are likely to provide some support its top line.However, the debt originations remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to remain muted. Also, with the rising interest rate environment, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment. As refinancing activities slowed down during the quarter, mortgage banking revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company’s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology. Also, M&T Bank witnessed increase in compensation expenses in the first quarter.Activities of M&T Bank during the quarter were adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been revised nearly 1% upward over the last seven days.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Apr 17.

170,BBT,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks was encouraging. The primary highlight was the release of the Fed minutes of the March FOMC meeting.The latest Fed minutes indicate that the officials are optimistic about the improving economic growth and rise in inflation. This is expected to support a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.The release of the minutes led to overall positivity in the markets and bank stocks didn’t remain untouched. Apart from this, easing U.S.-China trade war tension cheered investors to some extent.Banks’ first-quarter earnings were also in the spotlight over the past five trading sessions. This time, earnings are expected to be impressive driven by rebound in trading activities and higher interest rates. Also, modest loan growth will likely support results.Taking about company-specific headlines, as usual Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) dominated for all the wrong reasons.

Bank of the Ozarks, Inc.’s (OZRK  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents. The figure also represents improvement of 20.5% on a year-over-year basis.Results primarily benefited from an improvement in net interest income, driven by higher interest rates. Also, loans and deposit balances improved, which supported results to some extent. However, higher expenses, lower non-interest income and an increase in provisions were the undermining factors.Price PerformanceHere is how the seven major stocks performed: Company Last Week6 monthsJPM3.9%19.3%BAC3.4%21.4%WFC0.9%-3.3%C5.1%0.5%COF2.3%15.6%USB1.9%-4.0%PNC3.6%14.5%In the last five trading sessions, Citigroup and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) were the major gainers, with the banks’ shares gaining 5.1% and 3.9%, respectively.

171,BBT,"Northern Trust Corporation’s (NTRS  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results, scheduled for Apr 17, are expected to reflect a year-over-year rise in earnings and revenues.Notably, the company provides majority of its asset management services through the C&IS unit, which generates more than 50% of total revenues. A rise in revenues in this segment on the back of increased trading activities, will boost the company’s overall top line.Also, improved lending scenario, rising interest rates and bottom-line benefits from tax reform will provide further support to quarter’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 billion for sales for the to-be-reported quarter reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13%.Moreover, Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e. the computations are based on the prior quarter-end valuations. Since the performance of equity markets was relatively better in the first quarter, the company will likely be able to register growth in custody, servicing and management fees.Here are the other factors that might influence the company’s first-quarter performance:Modest Rise in Net Interest Income (NII): Overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Backed by improvement in loan balances, along with the effect of rising interest rates, Northern Trust is likely to record an increase in NII.Foreign Exchange Trading Revenues to Increase: Due to the rise in foreign exchange (FX) trading volatility and volumes, the company’s revenues from FX trading might increase.Custody Fees Might Rise: As Northern Trust uses lag effect in calculation of custody and investment management fees, expansion of three-month LIBOR rate along with higher trading activities are likely to drive related fees.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, custody fees are likely to increase 23.1% to $379 million.Marginal Increase in Expenses: Though Northern Trust has a cost-saving initiatives underway, continued investments in new business activities and seasonally higher compensation expenses may lead to a marginal rise in expenses.Let’s have a look at what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model doesn’t conclusively show that Northern Trust will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around, as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients.

172,BBT,"On Mar 14, the Senate passed a crucial Bill easing several of the regulations, which were put in place to guard against a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. The proposed legislation loosens norms mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which were put in place after the crisis led to many Americans losing their homes and jobs.The major beneficiaries of the new legislation appear to be regional banks, smaller community banks, regional lending institutions and credit unions. Though larger banks also received crucial reprieves, these were minor compared to the relief received by their smaller counterparts.The legislation now faces a crucial test in the House of Representatives, but given the bipartisan support it has received, smaller banks can expect easing up of regulations going forward. With rates set to rise and economic growth looking strong, investing in these banks looks like a smart option at this point. Regional Banks Receive ReprieveThe Senate’s banking Bill aims to raise the threshold for banks which are deemed too big to fail. This limit, currently set at $50 billion in terms of assets, will now be raised to $250 billion. This implies that only the largest U.S. banks would have to abide by the most stringent regulations stipulated by the Federal Reserve.This means that several midsized banks would no longer have to submit “living will” regulations which elaborately specify how banks intend to safely dispose of its assets in case of a failure.  Also, they would no longer have to undergo Federal Reserve stress tests on an annual basis.The beneficiaries of this clause include household names such as BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) and American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report).Major Relief for Community BanksOther major beneficiaries of the proposed law are smaller community banks and credit unions. Banks of this nature with less than $10 billion in assets will no longer have to comply with the Volcker Rule. This regulation prevents financial institutions from engaging in speculative trading. It was put in place to stop such banks from selling risky mortgages and to ensure that they could withstand difficult business conditions.Smaller banks have complained for some time that they were subject to rules which were targeted primarily at bigger financial players. A more contentious reprieve intends to reduce reporting requirements for mortgage data. Additionally, smaller banks would no longer have to comply with strict mortgage underwriting norms put in place by the Dodd-Frank Act.This rule was intended to determine whether banks were giving loans only to these individuals who had the ability to pay back these amounts. However, smaller banks have long complained that they find it difficult to comply with such regulations. The Bill’s supporters argue that the relaxation of these clauses will enable easier disbursal of mortgages and business loans, especially in rural areas.Our ChoicesThe Senate’s new bipartisan legislation significantly eases norms for mid-sized and smaller banks. While their ease of doing business will increase substantially if the new law is implemented, compliance related costs will likely decline.A stronger rate environment and an encouraging economic backdrop are already proving to be beneficial for banks. Given that regulatory restrictions are also likely to ease up in the near term, it makes sense to invest in smaller banks at this time.

173,BBT,"Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) consistent focus on improving loan and deposit balances along with higher interest rates will support net interest income (NII) growth. Further, the company’s expense control efforts are commendable. However, challenges faced by the bank in improving fee income remain a big concern.BofA is optimistic about favorable impact of the rate hike on margins and NII in the upcoming quarters with a continued rise in loan demand. The bank’s net interest yield increased from 2.19% in 2015 to 2.25% in 2016 and to 2.37% in 2017. Further, NII witnessed a three-year CAGR of 7% (till 2017 end) driven by higher rates and loan balance.For this year, management projects solid NII growth mainly attributable to loan and deposit growth as well as net interest yield expansion. This will be partially offset by absence of NII from the U.K. card business that was sold in 2017.Additionally, BofA’s expense-saving plan — Project New BAC (launched in 2011) — helped improve efficiency and save as much as $8.0 billion in operating expenses annually by 2014-end. Further, the same declined at a three-year (2015-2017) CAGR of 2.6%. The company remains committed to align its banking center network according to customers’ needs, through divestitures/consolidations of branches.BofA remains on track to reach its expense target of nearly $53 billion by 2018. Also, expenses are projected to remain relatively stable in 2019.Driven by strong fundamentals and upbeat outlook, BofA’s share price has increased 9.7% so far this year, outperforming the 6.1% rally for the industry it belongs to.However, BofA is facing problems in improving fee income. Over the last five years (2013-2017), non-interest income decreased at a CAGR of 2.6%. Mortgage banking income is witnessing a drastic downtrend due to a reduction in refinancing and a fall in origination volumes. A rise in interest rates is expected to further hurt mortgage fees.Also, absence of significant volatility and low client activity (as witnessed in major part of 2017) are likely to result in muted trading and investment banking revenue growth in the quarters ahead.Thus, analysts seem to have a neutral stance on the stock. The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained stable at $2.46 and $2.76 for 2018 and 2019, respectively, over the past 30 days. Thus, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some banks worth a look are BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Civista Bancshares, Inc. (CIVB  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

174,BBT,"Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) is planning to add nearly 600 new jobs at its offices in Hunt Valley. These will primarily be call centers and staff supportrelated jobs.BofA has a 377,000-square-feet financial center complex, consisting of two buildings, in Hunt Valley. Notably, last year, the bank already added 300 jobs at its Hunt Valley campus, which increased its total job force in that location to almost 900.According to Baltimore County officials, this addition of 600 jobs will raise the total workforce at the site to almost 1,500 by 2020.In order to handle the increasing workforce in its Hunt Valley campus, BofA has already increased space, renovated the interior and added parking.The company’s decision to expand in Hunt Valley has been praised by the county and state officials.Baltimore County Executive, Kevin Kamenetz said, “Bank of America chose to add hundreds of new jobs in Baltimore County because we listened and were able to provide what the company needed — a talented financial services workforce and fast-track design approval and permitting to meet their expansion timeline.”Kamenetz also said that the county made BofA’s task easier as it accelerated permit approvals for the work that the company did on its complex. He has noted that the county has one dedicated employee, who by giving permission, guides these types of projects.However, he said that BofA has not been given any financial incentives by the county for its work.According to the county’s announcement, Hunt Valley is “one of Baltimore County’s most vibrant employment centers.”In fact, Sabina Kelly, president of BofA’s Greater Maryland Market also noted that the company was glad to expand its operations in Baltimore County.Gov. Larry Hogan stated in a statement that the bank’s expansion of its operations in this area “is further proof that Maryland is Open for Business.”BofA’s efforts to streamline and simplify operations, as well as its initiatives to continuously align its banking center network according to customers’ needs, through divestitures/consolidations of branches, are expected to aid its financial performance.Shares of the company gained 33.6% in 2017, which outpaced the 18.9% rally for the industry.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

175,BBT,"Hancock Holding Company  remains well positioned for growth given its strategic initiatives, persistent growth in loan and deposit balances, and improving interest rate environment.The company’s price performance also looks impressive. Its shares have gained 14.9% in 2017, outperforming 3.3% growth of the industry.Also, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised more than 10% upward over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism regarding its earnings growth potential.However, the continued rise in operating expenses and the company’s high exposure to risky loan portfolio remain major concerns.Hancock Holding remains focused on its organic growth strategy. Its revenues have seen a CAGR of 7% over the past four years (2014-2017), supported by continued rise in loans (total loans net of unearned income increased at a six-year CAGR of 10.4% (2012-2017). Moreover, the company’s implementation of initiatives to enhance its core revenues looks encouraging. Further, its deal to acquire the asset management and trust business of Capital One will likely continue to support growth.Additionally, given the gradual improvement in the rate environment, Hancock Holding’s net interest margin (NIM) started to witness an increase after facing a declining trend over the past several years. Given the continued rise in loan demand and potential for more rate hikes, NIM is expected to improve further.Moreover, given a solid liquidity position, the company is expected to continue enhancing shareholder value through consistent dividend payments.On the flip side, mounting expenses remain a concern for the company. Total non-interest expenses (excluding non-operating expenses) have seen a four-year (2014-2017) CAGR of 4.6%. In fact, expenses are likely to remain elevated in the near term as the company continues to expand inorganically and hire additional workforce.Also, the company has significant exposure to residential mortgage, construction and land development as well as commercial real estate loans, which are expected to hurt financials. Though the housing sector has been gradually improving, any future deterioration in the real estate prices will pose a risk for the company. Additionally, while oil prices have gradually stabilized and stress in energy portfolio is no longer a big concern, the company’s exposure to such portfolio calls for higher provisions, which will strain its profitability.A few other stocks in the finance space that are witnessing improving earnings estimate revisions are Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report).Citigroup has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 6.8% for the current year over the past 60 days. Also, its share price is up nearly 24%, over the past year.BB&T’s earnings estimates have been revised upward by 12.1% for the current year in the past 60 days. Also over the past year, its share price increased nearly 10%.Comerica recorded an upward earnings estimate revision of 17.7% for the current year in the past 60 days. Also, its share price has increased more than 32% rise over the last year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

176,BBT,"At annual Investors’ Day conference, JPMorgan’s (JPM  -  Free Report) management discussed the current macroeconomic backdrop and the path the company is taking to enhance profitability over the medium term. Also, the company provided first-quarter and full-year 2018 guidance.Along with this, the company provided details about how the newly implemented Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will affect its financials going forward. While, lower taxes will decrease the income tax expense for the company, the same will have a slightly negative impact on net interest income (NII). However, this decline in NII is expected to be partly offset by the rising rate environment and loan growth.Notably, JPMorgan set its medium-term targets of cost-to-revenue ratio of 55% (despite continued investments in franchise), return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of nearly 17%, net payout ratio of 100% and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 11-12%.Further, JPMorgan expects pre-tax income to be nearly $44-$47 billion over the medium term, up from $40 billion recorded in 2017.First-Quarter and 2018 GuidanceNet Interest Income: In first-quarter 2018, JPMorgan’s NII will be down modestly on a sequential basis due to the impact of the change in tax rates and a lower day count. For 2018, NII will come in the range of $54-$55 billion (up from $50 billion in 2017), benefiting from loan growth and higher rates.Average core loan growth (excluding CIB loans) is expected to be in the range of 6-7% in 2018.Non-interest income: Management projects first-quarter market revenues to increase mid to high single-digit rate on a year-over-year basis, based on market conditions. Further, investment banking is anticipated to remain stable or increase slightly year over year.The new revenue recognition accounting rule is expected to increase 2018 non-interest revenues by nearly $1.2 billion, with the majority of impacts on the Asset & Wealth Management segment. Excluding this impact, non-interest revenues for the full-year are projected to be up 7%.Operating Expenses: The new revenues recognition accounting rule is expected to increase 2018 expenses by nearly $1.2 billion with the majority of impacts on the AWM segment. Excluding this impact, JPMorgan expects adjusted expenses to be less than $62 billion.Effective Tax Rate: As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 2018, effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19-20%.This lower effective tax rate is expected to reduce tax-equivalent revenues and income tax expenses by $1.2 billion on an annual run-rate basis.Credit Quality: JPMorgan expects net charge-off (NCOs) rate in 2018, to be relatively flat across the wholesale and consumer segments. On the other hand, NCOs rate in Cards is expected to increase to 3.25% in 2018 from 2.95% in 2017, due to the seasoning of newer origination vintages.Our TakeGiven the higher rates and persistent loan growth, JPMorgan remains well positioned for further growth in NII. While a slowdown in trading activities along with other factors has hurt the company’s non-interest income over the past few years, the expectation of a rise in markets as well as investment banking revenues might have some positive impact on total fee income in the quarters ahead.Given the upbeat outlook and improving operating environment, the company has plenty of upside left. JPMorgan’s shares have gained 23.9% in 2017, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18.8%.Currently, JPMorgan carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

177,BBT,"Over the last five trading days, performance of banking stocks remained optimistic. Rebound in trading activities (after dismal 2017 performance) is perhaps the primary reason for this bullish price performance.Banks like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) expect trading revenues to improve in first-quarter 2018. This is likely to be driven by solid revenues in foreign exchange, emerging markets and equities trading. Specifically, Citigroup expects “low-to-mid” single digit year-over-year increase in trading revenues and JPMorgan projects market revenues to rise in mid-to-high single-digit rate from the prior-year quarter.Additionally, progress in rolling back parts of the Dodd Frank Act cheered investors. The Senate is working on a bipartisan banking bill expected to lower stringent banking regulations. This will likely reduce regulatory compliance cost for several banks.On the other hand, mortgage rates continued to rise, with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.46% (marking the ninth consecutive weekly increase). The rise seems to be attributable to chances of rate hike later this month and impending trade war following the imposition of tariffs. This steady rise in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity, thereby hurting banks mortgage banking revenues to some extent.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, business misconducts continued to dominate headlines for Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Mar 2, 2018)Important Developments of the Week1. William Galvin, the top securities regulator of Massachusetts, announced that his office has started investigating the wealth management arm of Well Fargo to see if the division has been steering rollover money into managed accounts or if its employees have been making investment recommendations to clients that are unsuitable for them according to their needs.This investigation comes almost a week after Wells Fargo, in its 10K filling revealed that it was conducting an internal review to assess whether there had been unjustified referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments and referrals of brokerage customers to the bank’s investment and fiduciary services business.Wells Fargo had agreed to do a detailed investigation only after facing inquiries from the financial regulators in late 2017 for forcing customers to buy products and services they did not require.The bank did find that in some cases customers had been overcharged fees in connection with certain assets and accounts. There have been issues of incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record of the values associated with certain assets.However, Wells Fargo has not yet determined the number of accounts that were affected along with the reason that led to the wrongdoing.Shea Leordeanu, a spokeswoman for the bank’s brokerage division, recently said in a statement that the bank has made ""significant progress in our work to identify and fix any issues, make things right and build a better, stronger company.""Thus, Galvin said that his office was seeking information about the scope of Wells Fargo’s investigation. They have asked the bank to give them information regarding “inappropriate referrals of brokerage customers to managed and advisory accounts, unsuitable recommendations of alternative investments, as well as unsuitable referrals and recommendations in connection with 401(k) rollovers.”Galvin said, “Given the recent retirement savings crisis in America, referrals and recommendations involving 401(k) accounts should be closely scrutinized, in light of the Department of Labor’s Fiduciary Rule.”2.

178,BBT,"Over the last four trading days, volatility in the stock market has affected the banking stocks as well. The main highlight was the release of the Fed minutes of the January FOMC meeting. The latest report highlights that improving economic growth, stimulus from the recent tax cuts and rise in inflation support a more aggressive stance by the Fed in hiking rates.Further, given the growth in economy, low unemployment rate and healthy consumer sentiment, the demand for loans and other related products of banks will rise. Overall, though these will be beneficial for the banks’ financials, the markets seem to be wary of such a scenario. Thus, this led to significant volatility and bank stocks’ performance turned bearish over the last four trading sessions.Mortgage rates were also on an upswing, with 30-year mortgages averaging 4.40% (highest since April 2014), as money was pulled out of the bond market. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time losers. Rise in mortgage rates will limit refinancing activity.Coming to company-specific news related to banks, efforts to strengthen profitability persisted. Further, past business misconduct continued to haunt over the last four trading days.

In March 2017, the rating agency had rated U.S. Bancorp’s senior unsecured and subordinated debt as A1.Moody’s initiated the review on account of the $613 million settlement that U.S. Bancorp had agreed upon with several U.S. regulatory bodies last week due to shortcomings in its anti-money laundering and willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.Ratings for U.S. Bancorp’s subsidiaries along with its bank subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association, have been placed for review. U.S. Bank’s long-term deposits rating of Aa1, issuer and senior unsecured debt rating of A1, baseline credit assessment (BCA) of aa3 and counterparty risk assessment of Aa2(cr) are also under review. However, short-term ratings of Prime-1 for short-term deposits and senior debts were affirmed and are not under review.Following the legal settlement, Moody’s felt the necessity to review whether the company’s risk management system continues to be better in comparison to its competitors. Though, the settlement amount was beyond Moody’s expectations, it anticipates U.S. Bancorp’s earnings and capital position remains well poised to bear the impact.The rating agency will be considering whether U.S. Bank’s BCA rating of aa3 is still justified. Also, the changes in board processes along with oversight and the ability to guide management in identifying and mitigating potential future risk will be reviewed.U.S. Bancorp’s enterprise-wide risk governance, asset quality and operational risks will also be in focus of the review process. Notably, the company remains exposed to the risk of coming into light some other breach of law, which would lead to a violation of the two-year deferred prosecution agreement that the company had agreed upon with the regulators.4.

179,BBT,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) in a bid to pass on tax reform benefits to its shareholders announced 13.6% dividend hike to 37.5 cents per share and a one-time dividend. Both capital actions have been approved by the Federal Reserve.BB&T will pay 4.5 cents per share of one-time dividend on Mar 20 to shareholders of record as of Mar 6. This is in addition to the earlier announced quarterly dividend of 33 cents per share, which will be paid on Mar 1 to shareholders of record as of Feb 9.The bank expects the dividend payment of 37.5 cents per share to be continued in the second quarter of 2018 as well. Further, BB&T intends to request for additional capital deployments including dividend raise while submitting the 2018 capital plan to the Fed for review.In fact these are in addition to what the company had announced in December 2017 following the passage of the revised tax act. BB&T had notified additional investments of $152 million “in its associates and communities.” These included increasing minimum pay rate to $15 per hour, one-time bonus of $2,000 to roughly 75% of its associates and a $100-million donation to its philanthropic fund.Notably, BB&T is not the only bank that has undertaken such measures following the passage of the tax act. Several banks including Washington Federal, Inc. (WAFD  -  Free Report), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) and Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. (TCBI  -  Free Report) also passed on the benefits to their employees in the form of pay rise and one-time bonus, and plan to upgrade technology.Although for income investors, this is a great opportunity to chip in with their money but is BB&T worth a look for earning this additional dividend income? Let’s explore this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s financial performance and fundamentals to understand its share of risks and rewards.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.ConcernsMounting non-interest expenses is a major concern for BB&T. The increase is mainly due to a rise in personnel expenses and the company’s efforts to improve digitalization. As BB&T continues to expand inorganically and consolidates branches, overall costs will likely remain elevated in the quarters ahead.Also, the company’s ROE of 9.93% is lower than the industry average of 10.68%. This reflects that it is less efficient in utilizing shareholder funds compared with its peers.StrengthsBB&T’s overall organic growth strategy remains impressive, driven by increase in interest rates, higher loan demand and focus on strengthening its non-interest revenue sources. The company’s projected sales growth (F1/F0) of 2.6% accounts for a continuous growth momentum. Notably, management expects 2018 revenues (tax equivalent basis) to grow 2-4% year over year.Also, the bank is expected to deliver a strong earnings performance, indicated by its projected EPS growth of 39.8% for 2018 compared with the industry average of 25.6%.Further, BB&T relies extensively on acquisitions to support growth. In 2016, the company acquired National Penn and Swett and Crawford, which continues to be accretive to its earnings.

The rise was primarily driven by a significant increase in net gain on sale of loans.Non-interest expenses increased 3.2% from the year-ago quarter to $161.3 million, primarily due to a rise in employee compensation and benefits costs, deposit insurance expense and professional fees.Credit Quality: Mixed BagAs of Dec 31, 2017, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.38%, increasing from 0.13% as of Dec 31, 2016.

Also, the figure was up 21% year over year.Results were primarily driven by a rise in revenues (supported by higher interest rates), stable adjusted expenses and lower provision for credit losses. Also, improving asset quality was a tailwind. However, a decline in loan and deposit balances was the undermining factor.After considering one-time discrete gains including tax reform related benefit, net income available to common shareholders was $710 million, up 58% from the prior-year quarter.For 2017, adjusted earnings of $4.09 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06.

The figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.40 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 7% year over year to $1.47 billion. The rise was attributable to higher earning asset yields.On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 17 basis points (bps) to 3.17%, mainly reflecting higher earning asset yields and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. This was partly offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.Non-interest income was $833 million, up 2% from the prior-year quarter. The modest rise was largely driven by an increase in commercial real estate related income and wealth management-related income.Non-interest expenses rose 9% from the year-ago quarter to $1.52 billion. The increase was mainly due to several non-recurring items. After excluding those, operating expenses were relatively stable.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $741 million as of Dec 31, 2017, down 19% from prior-year quarter. Non-performing loans fell 12 bps year over year to 0.47% of total loans held for investment.Further, the rate of net charge-offs decreased 9 bps year over year to 0.29% of total average loans held for investment.

Easing margin pressure and initiatives to enhance efficiency are likely to support the company’s revenues. While slowdown in mortgage business makes us apprehensive, benefits from lower tax rates will support profitability.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc.

Also, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 16.5%.Strong fundamentals have helped shares of the company gain 40.2% in the past year, outperforming the 32.1% growth for the industry it belongs to.Will the rally in share price continue post Q4 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on if the company is able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates.Before we discuss the factors that are likely to influence Q4 results, let’s look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of BlackRock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +0.42%.Zacks Rank: BlackRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the odds of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Q4 ResultsWith its continued investments in U.S. iShare core ETFs, BlackRock remains a dominant player in the ETF market. Moreover, as investors are increasing their allocations toward ETFs instead of alternative investments in order to reduce management costs, the company’s iShares inflows are expected to remain strong in the quarter. Driven by steady inflows, the company’s AUM is likely to witness further improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM for the to-be-reported quarter is $6.15 trillion, which reflects a rise of 19.5% year over year.As a result of higher AUM in the quarter, the company’s investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, which constitute more than 85% of the total revenues, is also expected to witness improvement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $3.04 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 5.2%.Moreover, since the New York-based asset manager remains well diversified geographically, the average fee rate is likely to rise on the back of higher international flows amid recovering global economic conditions. Higher fee rate, coupled with growth in AUM will likely support performance fees growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for performance fee for the fourth quarter is $149 million, which is expected to witness growth of 15.5% year over year.Improvement in two of the major revenue components will likely give a boost to total revenues as well. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the quarter is $3.32 billion, which reflects growth of 14.8% year over year.However, BlackRock might witness an increase in costs in the to-be-reported quarter. BlackRock’s expenses have remained elevated over the last few years. Moreover, its plans of restructuring the traditional actively managed equities business and improving product offerings are expected to lead to a further increase in expenses.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18. It has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.28% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

187,BBT,"New Reads On Housing Starts And Building Permits
"
188,BBT,"We certainly have new Q4 earnings data to pass along to our readers ahead of the bell this morning, but being Thursday we also have weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Beyond this, we also see new reads on Housing Starts and the Philly Fed survey.A wild week-over-week swing in Initial Jobless Claims: -41K last week to a multi-decade low 220K. This follows the previous week’s spike up to 261K — both of which are outside the 225K-250K of the last 100 weeks or so. In fact, this 220K number is the lowest new claims number since Jim Croce was putting out hit songs on AM radio.That said, consider that these types of figures are susceptible to seasonal issues such as hiring during holiday shopping season. We won’t spend too much brain wattage trying to explain this drastic drop of more than 40,000 jobless claims in one week; future revisions should help iron these numbers out. Continuing claims were up last week: from 1.876 million the previous week to 1,952 million this week.Housing Starts posted a precipitous drop as well: -8.2% is 5 1/2 times worse than the -1.5% drop in starts analysts had been expecting, with a total of 1.192 million seasonally adjusted annualized new housing starts for the month of December. Revisions for November look to have been ratcheted down about -0.3%. Again, we might be looking a seasonality affecting these results; snowstorms in the South — as far as Florida — might have something to do with December’s big drop here.The Philly Fed survey — an economic production read of the U.S.’s 6th largest city — also underperformed expectations, though not by nearly as much: a read of 22.2 is beneath the 25 estimate for the month of January. This is not really a disappointment, however; Philly Fed numbers are historically volatile month by month, so being in the ballpark — and comfortably in positive territory — should suffice for now.The return rate on the 10-year bond has now crossed the 2.6% threshold, taking out the most recent top from March of last year, now going back to the highest U.S. 10-year bond yield since 2014. We will check for resistance points above this current read.Q4 Earnings: Banking IndustryThe Q4 earnings results keep pouring in from U.S. banks this week. Here are a few we are focused on:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rate Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of 84 cents per share beat by 7 cents, on revenues of $9.50 billion which easily outpaced the $9.2 billion expected. Underwriting fees jumped 42% in the quarter, somewhat offset by a lower fixed income segment. For full-year 2017, earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60 beat the Zacks consensus by 2 cents. For more on MS’s earnings, click here.KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #2 stock, just met expectations of 36 cents per share on the bottom line while surpassing estimates for quarterly revenues to $1.61 billion from the $1.58 billion anticipated. Revenues rose year over year by 2.7%. For more on KEY’s earnings, click here.Another Zacks Rank #2 stock, BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report), reported EPS of 84 cents, beating estimates by 4 cents per share.

Though disappointing to the Street, EPS growth year over year was 18.2%. For more on BK’s earnings, click here.Finally, M&T Bank (MTB  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #3, posted a nice positive surprise on its bottom line: $2.66 per share versus the Zacks consensus of $2.40. Revenues also topped expectations, coming in at $1.46 billion instead of the $1.42 billion estimate. For more on MTB’s earnings, click here.

191,BBT,"Easing margin pressure, enhanced capital deployment and continued synergies from the acquisition of GE Asset Management make State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) a promising pick right now.

Given its solid liquidity position and earnings strength, the company is expected to be able to sustain improved capital deployments and continue enhancing shareholders’ value.Strong Leverage: State Street’s debt/equity ratio is 0.61 compared with the industry average of 0.88, indicating relatively lower debt burden. This reflects the financial stability of the company even in adverse economic conditions.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): State Street’s ROE of 13.03% compared with the industry average of 10.29%, mirrors the company’s strong position over its peers.Stock Looks Undervalued: State Street stock seems undervalued when compared with the broader industry.

194,BBT,"The long wait for relief of regulatory burden may finally be over. While the Trump administration continues to push for the reversal the Dodd Frank Act, a bipartisan agreement announced on Monday came as a breather. This is expected to pave the way for significant changes and bring major relief to banks.Highlights of the AgreementThe major relief from the plan, unveiled by the Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, is likely to come in the form of reduction in the number of banks labeled as systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The bill aims to raise the threshold for SIFI to $250 billion in assets from the current $50 billion.This will lower the number of SIFI banks to just around a dozen from the present 40. Thus, the banks including SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report), which are presently under stringent supervision, will heave a sigh of relief.The move is expected to not only lower regulatory compliance costs but also lead to a wave of M&As for the banking industry. At present, consolidation in the industry is few and far between as banks try to put off crossing the threshold levels that trigger tougher rules.Per the plan put forward under the bipartisan deal, banks with assets in the range of $50-$100 billion will get immediate relief once the bill is enacted while those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be exempted 18 months later.Further, the bill gives authority to the Federal Reserve to fast-track the exemption. Notably, the Fed will be required to conduct stress test for banks in the $100-$250 billion range periodically.For several regional banks with more than $250 million in assets, the bill is not so important. Some of these Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) banks like The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), Capital One Financial Corp. (COF  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp, though functioning as community banks, will stay subjected to stricter regulations. This will put them in a disadvantageous position to some extent in terms of lower costs.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other BenefitsThe bill also has something to offer to the smaller community banks and credit unions with total assets of less than $10 billion. These will be exempted from implementing Volcker Rule (prevents proprietary trading) and from following stringent capital and liquidity rules as long as leverage ratio is in the range of 8-10%. Also, it aims to ease mortgage rules for small banks.Moreover, the bill is expected to be beneficial to trust and custodial banks like State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) and Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report). There is a provision that prevents deposits held at the Fed by such banks to be included in calculating the supplementary leverage ratio. This will aid these companies in clearing the annual stress tests.Reactions & Road AheadBankers and the overall banking industry cheered the deal. The KBW Regional Banking Index closed the day 1.3% higher.Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association in a statement said, “While this legislation could go much further, ABA still views this bipartisan bill as an important first step in right-sizing the rules for America’s banks.”Further, Crapo said, “The bipartisan proposals on which we have agreed will significantly improve our financial regulatory framework and foster economic growth by right-sizing regulation, particularly for smaller financial institutions and community banks.”Nonetheless, the road ahead is expected to be bumpy. The deal is not as aggressive as expected by many large banks and not enough to make sweeping changes in the regulations.Still, it is the most important step taken by the Senate to fulfill President Trump’s election promise of lessening banking regulations, which are stifling economic growth.

196,BBT,"The Q4 earnings season is knocking at the door and investors are keen to see how major banks will perform this time, after reporting impressive results in the first three quarters of 2017.The last year has been a roller coaster ride for banks. Though the year begun on an optimistic note with high expectations from President Trump’s electoral promises, it lost some steam in the middle only to regain the bullish trend at the end.Banks showed resilience driven by the Fed’s hawkish stance (three rate hikes in 2017) and the gradually improving U.S. economy. Also, progress on the lesser banking regulation front cheered investors.Further, the new tax act drove the banks too. While the act will result in gains for banks over the long term, the to-be-reported quarter earnings will be adversely affected by huge one-time charges related to the changes in the tax law.Additionally, factors that weighed on major banks’ prior-quarter results persisted in Q4 as well. These, including trading weakness, slowdown in mortgage banking and stable net interest margins, will likely hamper profitability of major banks. On top of these, the above-mentioned charges add fuel to the fire.Also, while the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings is expected to escalate costs moderately.As such, major banks in the S&P 500 index (accounting for nearly 45% of the Zacks Finance sector'stotal earnings) are expected to witness a 6.3% year-over-year decline in earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. This compares unfavorably with 6.5% growth recorded in the prior quarter.(For detailed look at the earnings outlook for this industry and others, please read our Earnings Analysis article).Nevertheless, strength in investment banking driven by a potential rise in equity issuances (strong rally in the equity market globally) and persistent increase in debt underwriting (mainly on assumption of continuous increase in interest rates) is expected to provide respite to some extent.In addition to the benefits from the rising interest rates, a slight improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and consumer will offer marginal support interest income for banks.Further, credit quality is anticipated to remain strong, backed by an improving economy and conservative underwriting standards.Choosing the WinnersWhile the upcoming results are not likely to be impressive, there are still a few major banks that are expected to outshine their peers. So, this is the right time for you to select some banking stocks that are well positioned to beat earnings estimates in their upcoming releases.Choosing stocks with earnings beat potential might be a difficult task unless one knows the process to shortlist. One way to do it is by picking stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.5 Major Banks Set for Earnings SurprisesHere are five major regional bank stocks that have the right combination of elements to deliver positive earnings surprises in their upcoming announcements:The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 12.

197,BBT,"The PNC Financial Services Group (PNC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 12, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Organic growth remains a key strength for PNC Financial. The quarter witnessed a rise in consumer confidence, which led to growth in consumer loan portfolio. Also, the rising interest rates came as an added advantage for the bank. Though, flatter yield curves offset the benefits to some extent, pressure on PNC Financial’s net interest margin is likely to ease slightly from the three rate hikes in 2017.Moreover, President Trump’s success in executing the tax overhaul boosted the stock market during the quarter, which would greatly support PNC Financial’s fee income. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $4.17 billion indicates a 7.6% year-over-year improvement for the to-be-reported quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.PNC Financial’s third-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to growth in loan balances and higher fee income. These factors also helped it in beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by higher expenses and provision for loan losses.Notably, PNC Financial delivered positive earnings surprises in each of the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average beat of 4.6%.The earnings beat translated into improved price performance. Over the past year, shares of PNC Financial have gained 21.8%, outperforming the 18.8% growth recorded by the industry.PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to PNC Financial’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Here’s what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of PNC Financial beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is +0.55%.Zacks Rank: PNC Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Though, earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 have been revised slightly downward over the past 30 days, they reflect year-over-year growth of 11.7% and 15.5%, respectively.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income to Grow: In addition to higher interest rates, moderate improvement in lending, mostly in the consumer front, is likely to perk up interest income. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest income is projected to be $2.39 billion, up 12.1% year over year.Management expects its net interest income for the to-be-reported quarter to increase in low-single digits on a sequential basis.Controlled Expenses: The company had a cost-saving program in place during the year to keep expenses under control. However, these efforts are likely to be partially offset by one-time restructuring expenses due to the tax reform.Muted Non-Interest Income: The fourth quarter was exceptionally good for the investment banking and underwriting business, which might support the company’s fee income.On the other hand, with overall low volumes of M&A during the quarter, the related fees are expected to be lower. Per the consensus estimate, total non-interest income is expected to be $1.75 billion, slightly up year over year.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.15% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

198,BBT,"BankUnited, Inc. (BKU  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 62 cents, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Moreover, the bottom line increased 31.9% from the year-ago-quarter.Results were primarily driven by an increase in both net interest income and non-interest income. Also, the company witnessed strong growth in loans and deposits. However, higher expenses hurt results to quite an extent. Further, an increase in provisions was an undermining factor. It is probably due to these negatives that the shares of the company declined nearly 1.6% following the release.Net income for the quarter increased 33.3% year over year to $67.8 million.Revenues Improve, Costs IncreaseNet revenues for the quarter came in at $294.6 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $273.5 million. Further, the reported figure increased 19.4% year over year.Net interest income climbed 8.8% year over year to $241.3 million, led by higher interest income, partially offset by an increase in interest expenses.Net interest margin decreased 7 basis points year over year to 3.62%. Continued run-off of high-yielding covered loans and an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities led to the margin contraction.Non-interest income was $53.3 million, increasing significantly from the year-ago quarter. The rise was primarily driven by an increase in net gain on investment securities available for sale.Non-interest expenses increased 5.9% from the year-ago quarter to $156.7 million due to a rise in all the components, except other non-interest expense and professional fees.Credit Quality DeterioratedAs of Sep 30, 2017, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.39%, increasing from 0.13% as of Dec 31, 2016. Also, nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.99%, increasing from 0.70% as of Dec 31, 2016.Further, provision for loan losses for the quarter was $37.9 million, up from $24.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Solid Balance Sheet & Capital RatiosAs of Sep 30, 2017, net loans totaled $20.5 billion compared with $19.2 billion as of Dec 31, 2016. Further, total deposits amounted to $21.2 billion, increasing from $19.5 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.As of Sep 30, 2017, Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.6%, while Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio came in at 11.9%. Further, total risk-based capital ratio was 12.7% as of the same date.Profitability IncreasesAs of Sep 30, 2017, quarterly return on average assets was 0.92%, increasing from 0.76% as of Sep 30, 2016. Also, return on average stockholders’ equity was 10.21%, up from 8.52% as of Sep 30, 2016.Our TakeBankUnited’s revenue growth is commendable. Also, the company’s consistent growth in loans and deposits is impressive. This testifies that BankUnited is well positioned to grow organically and through acquisitions, given its strong balance sheet position.However, exposure to risky loans and continued margin pressure, due to a liability-sensitive balance sheet, could hurt the company’s financials.BankUnited, Inc.

Results reflected an increase in revenues and higher expenses. The quarter witnessed a decrease in loans and leases and deposits. Additionally, provision for credit losses decreased, which was a tailwind.Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.27, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20. Results reflected an increase in revenues supported by easing margin pressure and higher fee income. However, higher provisions and a decrease in loans balance remained major headwinds.KeyCorp’s (KEY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 35 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were supported by revenue synergies from the First Niagara Financial Group acquisition deal (completed in August 2016) and higher interest rates. On the other hand, higher operating expenses were on the downside.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

199,BBT,"Thursday, January 18, 2018We certainly have new Q4 earnings data to pass along to our readers ahead of the bell this morning, but being Thursday we also have weekly Initial Jobless Claims. Beyond this, we also see new reads on Housing Starts and the Philly Fed survey.A wild week-over-week swing in Initial Jobless Claims: -41K last week to a multi-decade low 220K. This follows the previous week’s spike up to 261K — both of which are outside the 225K-250K of the last 100 weeks or so. In fact, this 220K number is the lowest new claims number since Jim Croce was putting out hit songs on AM radio.That said, consider that these types of figures are susceptible to seasonal issues such as hiring during holiday shopping season. We won’t spend too much brain wattage trying to explain this drastic drop of more than 40,000 jobless claims in one week; future revisions should help iron these numbers out. Continuing claims were up last week: from 1.876 million the previous week to 1,952 million this week.Housing Starts posted a precipitous drop as well: -8.2% is 5 1/2 times worse than the -1.5% drop in starts analysts had been expecting, with a total of 1.192 million seasonally adjusted annualized new housing starts for the month of December. Revisions for November look to have been ratcheted down about -0.3%. Again, we might be looking a seasonality affecting these results; snowstorms in the South — as far as Florida — might have something to do with December’s big drop here.The Philly Fed survey — an economic production read of the U.S.’s 6th largest city — also underperformed expectations, though not by nearly as much: a read of 22.2 is beneath the 25 estimate for the month of January. This is not really a disappointment, however; Philly Fed numbers are historically volatile month by month, so being in the ballpark — and comfortably in positive territory — should suffice for now.The return rate on the 10-year bond has now crossed the 2.6% threshold, taking out the most recent top from March of last year, now going back to the highest U.S. 10-year bond yield since 2014. We will check for resistance points above this current read.Q4 Earnings: Banking IndustryThe Q4 earnings results keep pouring in from U.S. banks this week. Here are a few we are focused on:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rate Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines, with earnings of 84 cents per share beat by 7 cents, on revenues of $9.50 billion which easily outpaced the $9.2 billion expected. Underwriting fees jumped 42% in the quarter, somewhat offset by a lower fixed income segment. For full-year 2017, earnings per share (EPS) of $3.60 beat the Zacks consensus by 2 cents. For more on MS’s earnings, click here.KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #2 stock, just met expectations of 36 cents per share on the bottom line while surpassing estimates for quarterly revenues to $1.61 billion from the $1.58 billion anticipated. Revenues rose year over year by 2.7%. For more on KEY’s earnings, click here.Another Zacks Rank #2 stock, BB&T (BBT  -  Free Report), reported EPS of 84 cents, beating estimates by 4 cents per share.

200,BBT,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents. The bottom line recorded 7.7% improvement from the year-ago quarter.Results reflected a rise in revenues driven by higher rates and loan growth. However, an increase in operating expenses and higher credit costs were the undermining factors.Results excluded merger-related and restructuring charges and adjustments related to the tax reform. After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $614 million or 77 cents per share compared with $592 million or 74 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.For 2017, adjusted earnings of $3.14 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.77. Also, the figure was up 9.4% year over year. After considering non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders was $2.2 billion or $2.74 per share compared with $2.2 billion or $2.77 per share in 2016.Revenues Improve on Modest Loans & Deposits GrowthTotal revenues (taxable-equivalent) for the quarter came in at $2.91 billion, up 5% year over year. The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84 billion.For 2017, total revenues (taxable equivalent basis) were up 4.8% from the prior year to $11.5 billion. The figure was marginally above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.4 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income rose 4.7% from the prior-year quarter to $1.68 billion. Also, net interest margin expanded 11 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.43%.Non-interest income increased 5.4% year over year to $1.23 billion. Rise in all fee income components except insurance income and mortgage banking fees, drove the increase.Non-interest expenses of $1.86 billion increased 11.2% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a rise in personnel expenses, net merger-related and restructuring charges and professional service costs.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 57.2%, down from 58.3% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates rise in profitability.As of Dec 31, 2017, total deposits were nearly $157.4 billion, up marginally from the prior quarter. Also, total loans and leases of $144.8 billion were up slightly on a sequential basis.Credit Quality ImprovedAs of Dec 31, 2017, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $627 million, down 22.9% year over year. As a percentage of total assets, NPAs came in at 0.28%, down 9 bps year over year.Also, during the quarter, allowance for loan and lease losses came in at 1.04% of total loans and leases held for investment, on par with the prior-year quarter. Further, net charge-offs were 0.36% of average loans and leases, down 6 bps year over year.However, provision for credit losses was $138 million at the end of the quarter, reflecting a 7% increase on a year-over-year basis.Profitability Ratios Strong, Capital Ratios WeakenAt the end of the reported quarter, return on average assets was 1.19%, up from 1.16% in the prior-year quarter. Return on average common equity improved to 9.10% from 8.75% as of Dec 31, 2016.As of Dec 31, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.8%, down from 12.0% in the year-ago quarter. BB&T's estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was approximately 10.0% as of Dec 31, 2017, down from 10.2% as of Dec 31, 2016.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, BB&T repurchased $373 million worth shares through open-market purchases.Our TakeBB&T remains well positioned for revenue growth through strategic acquisitions. These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Also, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, is likely to propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead. However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability to some extent.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

201,BBT,"When the Federal Reserve had begun quantitative easing (QE) program in November 2008 and lowered the interest rates to near zero, the economy was in a mess with a significantly high unemployment rate, plummeting housing and financial markets, and lower consumer spending. The main goal was to stabilize the economy and spur growth, primarily by revitalizing the banks.With the Fed injecting money into the economy, banks had more money to lend and earn from that. This liquidity infusion also fueled deposit growth. Over the years, major banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report), Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report) and BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) recorded a significant increase in their deposit balances.As the economy was in shambles, lending activity failed to rise significantly. So, the banks were saddled with considerable amount of deposits. But with gradual economic recovery, loan demand improved. Along with this, banks witnessed a rise in deposits. So, they didn’t face much competition for attracting deposits to meet higher demand for loans.As economy has stabilized and there seems to be no need for liquidity support, the Fed is gradually tightening its monetary policy. In December 2015, the central bank raised its interest rates for the first time in a decade. Since then, three more rate hikes have been announced.Given the continued improvement in the economy, interest rate hikes will likely continue. With banks being one of the biggest beneficiaries of higher rates, this will support their revenue growth.Moreover, last month, the Fed announced the timeline for commencing its balance-sheet (currently standing at a whopping $4.5 trillion) normalization program. Banks are likely to benefit from this as well. As the Fed buys back short-term duration securities, the yield curve will become steeper. This, in turn, will result in rise in the yield on long-term bonds and thus banks will gain from improved margin spreads.While everyone is looking at the banks’ benefits from the Fed’s tightening monetary policy, there is a downside to it as well.Increased Competition for DepositsThe Fed’s plan to unwind its balance sheet is expected to result in deposit outflows. Also, as the money supply in the economy will reduce, lesser amount will get deposited in the banks.Such a scenario will lead to increased competition among banks to attract deposits. Similar sentiments are being echoed by top executives of major banks.William Demchak, chairman and chief executive of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC  -  Free Report), at an investors’ conference in September noted that competition for customer deposits could increase “partly as a result of the Fed draining cash out of the system by shrinking its balance sheet.”Earlier in July at second quarter earnings conference call, U.S. Bancorp’s (USB  -  Free Report) chief financial officer Terrance Dolan said “…as excess liquidity comes out of the market you could expect to see and you will expect to see more competition with respect to deposits.”Competition will likely be more intense for wholesale deposits — those coming from institutional clients and large companies.Also, as the rise of online banking has made it easier from customers to switch banks and with the Fed expected to further increase interest rates, it will become easy for banks to offer higher rates on deposits. For customers stuck with persistently low deposit rates till now, banks providing higher rates on savings account will become more attractive.Nevertheless, with economy improving gradually, deposits are expected to rise as well. Specifically, retail deposits are expected to rise driven by higher rates on deposits.Overall, deposits are expected to continue increasing given the economic growth, though the pace of rise is likely to be slower compared with the QE period.Of the above-mentioned major banks, JPMorgan, BB&T, Bank of America, PNC Financial and Citigroup carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

202,BBT,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has been witnessing growth in loans and deposits. Also, rising rates have led to an increase in revenues. Strategic acquisitions have consistently been helping the company expand its footprint and fuel profitability. However, escalating costs owing to acquisitions and subsequent integrations are expected to curb BB&T’s bottom-line growth. Also, the company’s exposure to risky loans continues to be a near-term concern.BB&T’s overall organic growth strategy remains impressive with continued rise in loans and non-interest bearing deposits. Over the last five years (2012-2016), loans and leases have witnessed a CAGR of 5.2%, while non-interest bearing deposits have seen a 3-year (2014-2016) CAGR of 14.3%. Both witnessed a rising trend in the first six months of 2017.The company acquired National Penn and Swett and Crawford in 2016, which continue to be accretive to its earnings. While it plans to expand its footprint further in Texas and Pennsylvania through acquisitions, its key focus is to increase revenues from insurance operations from the current 15% to 20% of total revenues over time. For this, the company intends to acquire more insurance agencies. Such strategic initiatives should support bottom-line growth.Driven by such initiatives, analysts are optimistic about the earnings prospects of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has increased nearly 1% over the last 30 days.On the flip side, mounting operating expenses have been curbing BB&T’s bottom-line growth. Total operating expenses have been showing a persistent rise with a five-year (2012-2016) CAGR of 3.6%, largely attributable to acquisitions and subsequent integrations.The company holds a large amount of risky loans that could pose a problem in case of further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions because of its exposure to commercial, direct retail lending and residential mortgage loan portfolios which were more than 77% of total loans and leases.Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 22.1% in the past 12 months, compared with 40.1% rise for the industry. Stocks to ConsiderStocks in the finance industry worth considering include State Street Corp.

203,BBT,"The Federal Reserve is set to wrap up its two-day policy-setting meeting on Wednesday. As the result day approaches, speculation on the Fed’s action is growing.As the current inflation rate remains below the Fed’s target level, chances of an interest rate hike are low this time around. However, this time around, investors are waiting for another important decision that might significantly benefit banks.In the June meeting, the Fed had hinted that it would start unwinding its huge balance sheet by the end of 2017. And rumours suggest that the trimming might start in September itself and investors are expecting this meeting to specify how the process will be rolled out.The Fed’s quantitative easing policy during the recession to increase money supply in the economy and support the struggling banking industry made it purchase a large number of financial assets from banks.Of the assets purchased, most were treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed kept on reinvesting the proceeds of the maturing securities. As a result of this, its balance sheet now stands at a whopping $4.5 trillion.However, now, as the economy has more or less stabilized, the Fed wants to start unwinding its balance sheet.For this, it may either sell some of its securities or stop reinvesting the proceeds.If the Fed decides to buy back some or all the short-term duration securities, the yield curve will become steeper. This means that the yield on long-term bonds will increase.Since banks borrow at the short-term rates but lend at long-term rates, their net-interest margin spreads will widen.Major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report), BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report), The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) and Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) have already been witnessing a gradual improvement in their margins with the rate hikes so far. They will benefit further if the Fed’s balance-sheet action steepens the yield curve.   Although the balance sheet trimming is a long and gradual process, it will definitely help banks to improve their margins further.Each of the banks mentioned above currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

204,BBT,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) remains well positioned for organic growth, supported by a rise in loan and deposit balances. Also, easing margin pressure should aid its top-line growth in the upcoming quarters.However, the company’s expenses remain elevated, which might curb profitability growth. Also, its significant exposure to risky loan portfolios remains a concern.The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings has been revised 1.4% downward over the past 30 days. The stock currently carries just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking at the fundamentals, the company’s loans and leases have increased at a CAGR of 5.2% in the last five years (2012–2016). Also, non-interest bearing deposits have increased at a three-year (2014-2016) CAGR of 14.3%.Moreover, the company has also been relying on a number of strategic acquisitions to grow inorganically.The company has an efficient share repurchase and dividend payment policy in place. Supported by a solid capital position, it should continue to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities.Further, with the interest rate environment improving gradually, BB&T’s margin pressure seems to be easing. This is expected to aid its top-line growth. Notably, following the latest Fed rate hike, the company raised its prime lending rate to 4.25%.However, the company’s expenses have increased at a CAGR of 3.6% over the last five years (as of the end of 2016). Given that it plans to continue with its acquisitions and mergers in the future, expenses are expected to remain elevated, thereby hurting bottom-line growth.Also, the company’s significant exposure to commercial, direct retail lending and residential mortgage loan portfolios pose risks. Although it has been successfully disposing assets, it still holds a large amount of risky loans that could pose a problem in case of further deterioration in macro-economic conditions.BB&T’s shares have gained 21.2% in a year’s time, underperforming the 30.8% growth for the industry it belongs to. Given these concerns, the stock’s movement is expected to be range-bound in the near term.Mentioned below are a few better-ranked stocks from the finance space:Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of 8.9% for the current year over the past 30 days. Its share price has increased 48.7% in a year’s time. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

205,BBT,"As expected by the markets, SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) has announced a raise in its stock dividend. This followed the approval of its 2017 capital plan by the Federal Reserve in June.SunTrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents per share, up a whopping 54% from the prior payout. The dividend will be paid on Sep 15 to shareholders on record as of Aug 31. Based on the last day’s closing price of $58.05 per share, the dividend yield is 2.76%.Additionally, SunTrust’s capital plan includes authorization to repurchase $1.32 billion worth of shares, through the third quarter of 2018.Other than SunTrust, several other major regional banks including BB&T Corp. (BBT  -  Free Report), Comerica Inc. (CMA  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) increased their quarterly dividends (as part of their 2017 capital plan) in the range of 10–60%.Given its solid liquidity position, earnings strength and lower debt level, SunTrust is likely to be able to sustain improved capital deployments and also continue enhancing shareholders’ value going forward. But is it worth considering this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to earn this dividend income?Let’s dig deeper into its financial performance and fundamentals to understand the risk and rewards.SunTrust’s net revenue witnessed compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.1%, over the last four years (2013–2016). The increase has been backed by strong loan and deposit growth along with the efforts to enhance revenue growth through several initiatives. The company’s projected sales growth for 2017 is 5.2%.Further, SunTrust has witnessed 13.3% rise in earnings per share over the last three to five years. The trend is expected to continue in the near term as well. The company’s projected EPS growth is 13.7% and 9.2% for 2017 and 2018, respectively.Also, SunTrust’s cost-saving measures have borne results and support profitability. Though non-interest expenses declined at a four-year CAGR (2013–2016) of 2.1%, the trend reversed in the first half of 2017 and in 2016 (in sync with its efforts to enhance revenue growth). Nonetheless, as the company continues with its initiatives of consolidating branches, the overall expense level is expected to remain manageable.Despite these favorable trends, the stock has gained 5.9% compared with the industry’s rally of 7.2% so far this year.SunTrust’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undercuts its growth potential. Though the company’s ROE of 7.60% has gradually improved over the years, it compares unfavorably with ROE of 8.72% for the industry and 15.66% for the S&P 500, reflecting its low efficiency in using shareholders’ funds.Additionally, SunTrust stock looks overvalued based on its price-to-book (P/B) ratio. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 1.25, which is near its high over the last five years.Also, the stock has a Value Style Score of ‘C’. The Value Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of ‘value traps’ and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount. Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of ‘A’ or ‘B’, when combined with Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.With a steady dividend income opportunity, SunTrust stock appears to be a good investment option now based on its strong fundamentals. However, investors should keep an eye on the stock’s performance as it is significantly overvalued.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

206,BBT,"Shares of TCF Financial Corporation (TCF  -  Free Report) rose 2.2% in single-day trading following the third-quarter 2017 earnings release on Oct 27, before the market opened. The company reported earnings per share of 29 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the prior-year quarter figure of 31 cents.Despite an earnings miss on elevated expenses and provisions, investors were optimistic on strong top-line performance which led shares to rise.Furthermore, margin pressure seems to be easing. The quarter also witnessed continued rise in loans and deposits, while maintaining a solid capital position. However, declining fee income raises concern.The company reported net income of $60.5 million, up 7.5% from $56.3 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Escalate, Cost Pressure PersistsTotal revenues came in at $343.3 million in the quarter, up 3.5% year over year. However, the top line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Net interest income was up nearly 10.4% year over year to $234.1 million. The rise was mainly attributable to increased interest income on loans and leases, partially mitigated by decreased interest income on loans held for sale and rise in total interest expense.NIM of 4.61% expanded 27 basis points (bps) year over year due to higher average yields on the variable-and adjustable-rate loans due to rise in interest rate, partly mitigated by elevated average rates on certificates of deposit.Non-interest income came in at $109.2 million, down 8.7% on a year-over-year basis. Absence of net gains on sales of auto loans and reduced net gains on sales of consumer real estate loans, along with lower fees and other revenues, mainly led to the fall.TCF Financial reported non-interest expenses of $235 million, up 2.7% from the prior-year quarter. The rise mainly reflected significant increases in net other credit costs and operating lease depreciation.As of Sep 30, 2017, average deposits improved 2.9% year over year to $17.6 billion. Average loans and leases climbed 6.2% year over year to $18.4 billion in the quarter.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagCredit quality for TCF Financial reflected mixed credit metrics. Net charge-offs, as a percentage of average loans and leases, contracted 8 bps year over year to 0.18%. The decline was chiefly attributable to an improved credit quality in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by increase in net charge-offs in the auto finance portfolio.Additionally, non-accrual loans and leases, and other real estate owned plunged 34.7% year over year to $146 million.However, provisions for credit losses were $14.5 million, up 4.7% year over year, primarily due to higher reserve requirements associated with the recent hurricanes.Robust Capital PositionTCF Financial’s capital ratios remained strong. As of Sep 30, 2017, Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.05% compared with 10.24% as of Dec 31, 2016. Total risk-based capital ratio was 13.21% compared with 13.69% as of Dec 31, 2016. Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 10.88%, up from 10.73% as of Dec 31, 2016.Our ViewpointTCF Financial delivered a decent performance in the third quarter. Consistent top-line improvement reflects the company’s sturdy standing in the market. At the same time, a strengthening capital position and improving credit quality in consumer real estate portfolio are expected to favor the company’s future growth. In addition to this, we believe the company’s efforts to reduce balance sheet risk and diversify the loan portfolio will augur well for its earnings in the subsequent quarters. Also, steady improvement in the economy will support the future performance of the company.Nevertheless, we remain apprehensive owing to several issues, including an expanding cost base and decline in fee income. TCF Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise TCF Financial Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | TCF Financial Corporation QuoteTCF Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Further, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $329.6 million.Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis climbed 12.2% year over year to $264.4 million. The upswing is primarily attributable to a rise in earning assets, higher yields on loans and increase in cash balances.Moreover, net interest margin expanded 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.73%, as the Fed’s interest rate hikes led to higher yielding assets.Non-interest income totaled $81.6 million, slightly down from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was mainly due to net loss on securities transactions and lower insurance commissions and fees.Non-interest expenses of $186.8 million flared up 3.5% year over year. Increase in almost all the cost components led to elevated expenses in the reported quarter.Strong Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, 2017, total loans were $12.7 billion, up 9.5% year over year.

Growth in loan and deposit balance indicates continued organic growth. Also, the company remains well poised to benefit from easing margin pressure.

Elevated market interest rates, impact of balance-sheet management strategies, favorable credit-related interest recoveries and deposit cost management drove the results. These increases were partially offset by reduced average loan balances.Non-interest income declined 14% to come in at $515 million. Lower mortgage income, capital markets fee income and other non-interest income primarily led to the fall. On an adjusted basis, non-interest income decreased 7% year over year.Notably, management expects growth in capital market revenues, slight increase in mortgage, wealth management, and card & ATM fees to accelerate non-interest income in Q4.Non-interest expense dipped 5.1% year over year to $886 million.

The company’s favorable funding mix, attractive core business and revenue diversification strategies will likely yield profitable earnings in the upcoming quarters. We also remain optimistic on the company's branch-consolidation plan and reduction of $300 million in expenses by 2018 and an additional $100 million by 2019, in a bid to achieve an efficiency ratio below 60%.Nevertheless, higher provisions and lower non-interest income remain headwinds.

Also, the figure was up 10% year over year.Better-than-expected results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. Also, modest loan growth acted as a tailwind. A decline in provision for credit losses was another positive for the company.Net income available to common shareholders was $505 million, up 6% year over year.Net Interest Income Growth Offsets Higher CostsTotal revenue (FTE basis) for the quarter grew 2% from the prior-year quarter to $2.27 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 9% year over year to $1.44 billion. The rise was attributable to growth in average earning assets and higher net interest margin (NIM).On a year-over-year basis, NIM was up 15 basis points (bps) to 3.14%, reflecting higher earning asset yields, favorable impact of continued positive mix shift in the loan portfolio and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio.Non-interest income was $827 million, down 8% from the prior-year quarter. The fall was largely due to lower net securities gains, mortgage production related income and other non-interest income.Non-interest expenses were up 3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion. The rise was mainly due to an increase in most expense categories, other than operating losses and other non-interest expense.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $821 million as of Jun 30, 2017, down 18% from prior-year quarter.

Easing margin pressure (given the improvement in interest rates) and initiatives to enhance efficiency should support the company’s revenues.However, the company’s significant exposure to commercial and residential loan portfolios remains a major near-term concern.

After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $631 million or 77 cents per share compared with $541 million or 66 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues up, Costs DownTotal revenue (taxable-equivalent) for the quarter came in at $2.90 billion, up 3.9% year over year.Tax-equivalent net interest income rose 1.1% from the prior-year quarter to $1.68 billion. Also, net interest margin increased 6 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.47%.Non-interest income increased nearly 8% year over year to $1.22 billion. Rise in almost all fee income components, except mortgage banking income, led to the growth. Also, the quarter witnessed nil net FDIC loss share income.Non-interest expense of $1.74 billion decreased 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a fall in amortization of intangibles, net merger-related and restructuring charges and outside IT services related costs.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 58.6%, down from 59.6% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates a rise in profitability.As of Jun 30, 2017, total deposits were nearly $157 billion, down from $161.3 billion in the prior-quarter. However, total loans and leases were $145.1 billion, up 0.8% sequentially.Credit Quality: A Mixed BagAs of Jun 30, 2017, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $690 million, down 22.1% year over year.

These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Moreover, consistent growth in loans along with improving rate scenario should propel its organic growth trajectory.However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability. Also, the company’s exposure to risky loans continues to be a near-term concern.BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

215,BBT,"Earnings season for the banks has already begun and the results released so far by the big banks reflect a challenging second-quarter 2017. Despite hikes in interest rates by the Fed (twice this year), banks seem to be struggling to improve their net interest margin, owing to lower treasury yields.Other headwinds include soft capital market businesses and dismal performance of the investment banking business. Also, modest rise in mortgage origination is expected to hurt mortgage banking revenues.On the other hand, loan demand improved on a sequential basis. Per the Federal Reserve’s latest data, both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans are expected to increase, while growth in consumer loans remained soft. Therefore, interest income for banks is projected to improve marginally.On the cost front, the chance of a significant rise in expenses is low, though a marginal increase in expenses could occur owing to digitization. As cost-saving efforts continue supporting the bottom-line performance, overall expenses are expected to remain manageable in the quarter.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the major banks in second quarter are projected to grow 4.5% year over year.So, this is the right time to add a few banking stocks in case they beat earnings estimates.Our quantitative model offers some insights into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model, in order to be confident of an earnings beat, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.

However, we also need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsRising Rates to Boost Margin: With the improvement in the rate scenario, BB&T’s net interest margin might have improved in the quarter. The company expects the March rate hike to lead to an increase in core NIM by 2–4 basis points on a sequential basis.Revenues to Improve Slightly: There was a modest improvement in loan demand in the quarter. The company projects average loans to grow 1–3% sequentially, driven by improvement in commercial, specialized and retail loan portfolios. Higher loan balances might have supported net interest income growth to some extent.Notably, the company expects NII to improve in the range of 2–4%, given the improved margin assumption. Also, fee income is expected to be up 6–8% year over year.Expenses Might Increase Modestly: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses to remain flat or increase slightly on a year over year basis.Asset Quality to Support Results: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in the quarter. Also, management expects NCOs to remain in the range of 0.35–0.45%. Non-performing asset levels will likely remain stable sequentially.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.Citizens Financial Group, Inc.

217,BBT,"Over the last five trading days, major banks displayed a bearish trend. The earnings season has kick started and this time, banks are expected to be hurt by a tough operating backdrop. This seems to be one of the primary reasons for investors’ pessimistic stance.A number of factors including weak trading and investment banking activities, lower-than-expected interest rates and lesser demand for refinancing activities during the quarter must be weighing on investors’ mind. All these are expected to hurt banks’ revenue growth to some extent. With expense reduction not likely to be a major support, there is less chance of impressive growth in the banks’ bottom line.Nonetheless, the last five trading sessions witnessed streamlining efforts. Banks are continuing with such initiatives with an aim to focus on core operations and enhance profitability, going forward.(Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Jul 7, 2017)Important Developments of the Week1.

218,BBT,"Most banks that reported third-quarter 2017 results this week managed to record bottom-line improvement on the back of top-line strength and lower provisions. This also led to positive price movement for most bank stocks over the last five trading days.In addition to the benefits from higher interest rates, the results mirrored a marginal upswing in loans. Moreover, margin pressure seems to be easing significantly. Further, the rise in deposit balances helped drive organic growth at the banks.However, mortgage banking business was disappointing. Also, an overall rise in non-interest expenses owing to high spending on technology and personnel, and other market development initiatives was an undermining factor.

220,BBT,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 19, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, SunTrust’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from an improvement in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. A stable loan balance and an increase in deposits supported the results. However, a rise in provision for credit losses and lower non-interest income (mainly owing to mortgage banking woes) were the headwinds.SunTrust boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.7%.However, the company’s activities in the fourth quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.05 witnessed a decline of approximately 1% over the last 7 days. Nevertheless, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 16.7%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2.31 billion reflects an improvement of 7% from the prior-year quarter.The company’s price performance has also been impressive. Its shares have gained 22.1% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 18.1%.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company manages to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.A Positive Surprise in Store?According to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is +0.81%.Zacks Rank: SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Remain Stable: The fourth quarter witnessed modest loan growth. However, the company projects NII to be relatively stable year over year because balance sheet growth will most likely be offset by pressure on net interest margin (NIM). The company expects the fourth quarter NIM to decline in the range of 1-3 basis points.Relatively Stable Non-Interest Income: Refinancing activities increased during the quarter on the expectation of a higher interest rate environment. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, a big help is not expected from this segment and hence mortgage revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Nonetheless, despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. Thus, the related fees are projected to increase for SunTrust. Along with this, a rise in investment banking activities in the quarter should provide some support to the overall fee income growth.Expenses to Decline Slightly: The company’s initiatives of consolidating its branch networks are likely to translate into marginal expense reduction. Further, management expects overall expenses in 2017 to decline, given the low-cost employee benefits, along with the benefits of the company’s efficiency initiatives.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

222,BBT,"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 18, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Higher revenues and assets under management (AUM) growth were offset by an increase in expenses.BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and matched once in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.4%.However, activities of the company in the fourth quarter were not adequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents has remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects year-over-year growth of 18.2%.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $3.98 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting an improvement of 5.1% year over year.Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteBNY Mellon’s shares have gained 13.7% in 2017, underperforming the 18.9% growth of the industry it belongs to.Will the share price performance improve post Q4 earnings? To a great extent it depends on whether the company will be able to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +0.16%.Zacks Rank: BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsModest Improvement in Fee Revenues: The equity markets have performed decently in the fourth quarter. As a result, performance fee is expected to improve. Moreover, seasonally higher securities lending revenues during the quarter are likely to boost fee income growth.However, management projects Depositary Receipts revenues to decline nearly $80 million sequentially due to seasonality. While, lower DR revenues and expectation of a fall in foreign exchange trading revenues due to lower volumes might be offsetting factors, overall fee income is expected to improve during the quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee revenues of $3.10 billion reflects 5.4% year-over-year improvement.Higher Rates to Boost Net Interest Revenues (NIR): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $290.3 billion reflects a marginal improvement from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, overall loan balances witnessed modest improvement in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances along with the effect of rising interest rates, BNY Mellon should register an increase in NIR.Moreover, management believes any rate hike will lead to an improvement in margin. Hence, improving margins due to the increase in rates is likely to more than offset the reduced size of balance sheet and hence lead to a modest increase in NIR in the quarter. Notably, management expects NIR to be at the higher end of the 4-6% range in 2017.Expenses to Decline Slightly: Management expects legal and professional expenses to decline by nearly $10 million in fourth-quarter 2017. Despite the impact of investment-related expenses, overall costs are expected to decline.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corp.

223,BBT,"SunTrust Banks, Inc.'s (STI  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.06 per share were in line the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, the figure was up 16% year over year.Results were primarily driven by an increase in net interest income and a slight fall in operating expenses. Also, stable loan balance and an increase in deposits supported the results. However, a rise in provision for credit losses and lower non-interest income (mainly owing to mortgage banking woes) were the headwinds.Net income available to common shareholders was $512 million, up 12% from the prior-year quarter.Net Interest Income Growth Offsets Higher CostsTotal revenues (FTE basis) for the quarter grew 4% from the prior-year period to $2.31 billion. The figure was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.29 billion.Net interest income (FTE basis) increased 9% year over year to $1.47 billion. The rise was attributable to growth in average earning assets and higher earning asset yields.On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 19 basis points (bps) to 3.15%, reflecting higher earning asset yields and lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio. This was partly offset by higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.Non-interest income was $846 million, down 5% from the prior-year quarter. The fall was largely due to lower mortgage related income, partially offset by a rise in investment banking income.Non-interest expenses were down 1% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion. The fall was mainly due to a lower outside processing and software costs.Credit Quality ImprovedTotal non-performing assets were $792 million as of Sep 30, 2017, down 22% from prior-year quarter. Non-performing loans fell 19 bps year over year to 0.48% of total loans held for investment.Further, the rate of net charge-offs decreased 14 bps year over year to 0.21% of total average loans held for investment. However, provision for credit losses increased 24% from the year-ago quarter to $120 million reflecting anticipated losses from hurricanes.Strong Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, 2017, SunTrust had total assets of $208.3 billion while shareholders’ equity was $24.5 billion, representing nearly 12% of total assets.As of Sep 30, 2017, loans held for investments were relatively stable on a sequential basis at $144.3 billion.

Easing margin pressure and initiatives to enhance efficiency should support the company’s revenues.However, the company’s significant exposure to commercial and residential loan portfolios remains a major near-term concern. Also, slowdown in mortgage business makes us apprehensive.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc.

After considering these, net income available to common shareholders was $597 million or 74 cents per share compared with $599 million or 73 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Elevate, Loans & Deposits Fall, Costs Flare UpTotal revenues (taxable-equivalent) for the quarter came in at $2.85 billion, up 1.4% year over year. The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84 billion.Tax-equivalent net interest income rose 2.4% from the prior-year quarter to $1.69 billion. Also, net interest margin expanded 9 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 3.48%.Non-interest income inched up nearly 1% year over year to $1.17 billion. Rise in service charges on deposits, bankcard fees and merchant discounts, operating lease income and other income led to the growth. These increases were mostly offset by lower mortgage banking income and income from bank-owned life insurance. Also, the quarter witnessed nil net FDIC loss share income.Non-interest expense of $1.75 billion increased 2.3% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to a rise in personnel expense, net merger-related and restructuring charges and other expense.BB&T’s adjusted efficiency ratio came in at 58.3%, down from 58.7% in the prior-year quarter. A fall in efficiency ratio indicates a rise in profitability.As of Sep 30, 2017, total deposits were nearly $156.1 billion, down from $159.9 billion in the prior-year quarter. However, total loans and leases were $144 billion, down around 1% year over year.Credit Quality ImprovedAs of Sep 30, 2017, total non-performing assets (NPAs) were $680 million, down 19.3% year over year. As a percentage of total assets, NPAs came in at 0.31%, down 7 bps year over year. Also, during the quarter, allowance for loan and lease losses came in at 1.04% of total loans and leases held for investment, contracting 2 bps year over year.Furthermore, net charge-offs were 0.35% of average loans and leases, down 2 bps year over year. Provision for credit losses was $126 million at the end of the quarter, reflecting a 14.9% decrease year over year.Strong Profitability & Capital RatiosAt the end of the reported quarter, return on average assets was 1.16%, up from 1.15% in the prior-year quarter. Return on average common equity decreased to 8.82% from 8.87% as of Sep 30, 2016.As of Sep 30, 2017, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.8%, in line with the year-ago quarter. BB&T's estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III (on a fully phased-in basis) was approximately 10.1% as of Sep 30, 2017, in line with the year-ago quarter.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, BB&T repurchased $920 million worth shares through open-market purchases.Our TakeWe anticipate BB&T to remain well positioned for revenue growth through strategic acquisitions. These efforts will also support bottom-line growth in the near term. Moreover, expected growth in loans, along with an improving rate scenario, will likely propel its organic growth trajectory in the quarters ahead.However, such acquisitions are expected to keep costs toward the higher end, which might hurt profitability. Also, the company’s exposure to risky loans continues to be a near-term concern. BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BB&T Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteCurrently, BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

(C  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% in the third quarter on prudent expense management. Earnings per share of $1.42 for the quarter easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Also, earnings compared favorably with the year-ago figure of $1.24 per share. Notably, results included after-tax gain related to the sale of a fixed income analytics business.Amid an expected trading slump, rising rates and loan growth drove JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s (JPM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.76 per share, easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67. Also, the figure reflects an 11% rise from the year-ago period. Notably, the results included a legal benefit of $107 million. Solid loan growth (driven mainly by improved credit card loans) and elevated interest rates supported net interest income. In addition, rise in advisory fees supported the top-line growth. A slight fall in operating expenses acted as a tailwind.Wells Fargo & Company’s (WFC  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Including previously disclosed mortgage-related discrete litigation accrual of 20 cents per share, earnings came in at 84 cents per share, comparing unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.03 per share.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

226,BBT,"BB&T Corporation’s (BBT  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, slated on Thursday, Oct 19, are expected to witness a slight rise in tax equivalent net interest income (NII). This, in turn, will support the company’s revenues and bottom line.Improvement in loan demand, particularly commercial and industrial, and consumer loans during quarter will support NII. On an annualized basis, BB&T expects total loans to grow 1-3% sequentially while core loan growth is anticipated to be in the range of 5-7%.Further, BB&T expects to record stable core net interest margin (NIM). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NIM of 3.46% reflects 1 basis point fall from the prior quarter. This is likely to be attributable to higher interest rates, which will be more than offset by marginally lower average interest earning assets (the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earning assets is $193.3 billion).Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII of $1.68 billion shows marginal growth on a sequential basis. On the other hand, management expects NII to remain stable from the prior quarter.Now, let’s check out a few other factors that might influence BB&T’s Q3 performance:Lower non-interest income: BB&T has been witnessing continuous fall in mortgage banking fees as higher interest rates are leading to lower mortgage originations. However, an expected higher rate environment might have led to rise in demand for refinancing activities during the quarter, thus helping the company record some mortgage revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of $106 million shows a jump of 12.8% sequentially.Further, as deposit balance rises, the company will record an increase in service charge on deposits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for service charge on deposits of $179 million reflects a rise of 1.7% from the last quarter.However, BB&T is expected to record lower insurance income as hurricanes hit the U.S coast during the latter half of the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for insurance fees is $417 million, plunging 13.3% from the prior quarter.Overall, total non-interest income is projected to witness a 3.4% sequential fall as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.18 billion while management projects the same to grow 1-3% year over year.Expenses might increase modestly: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses to remain flat or increase 2% on a year-over-year basis.Asset quality to support results: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in addition to providing for loan growth. Also, management expects NCOs rates to remain in the range of 0.35-0.45%.Non-performing asset (NPAs) levels will likely remain stable with the prior quarter. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NPAs is $690 million, stable sequentially.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of BB&T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BB&T is +0.43%.Zacks Rank: BB&T carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).As it is we caution investors against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 1.3% downward over the last 60 days to 78 cents, with four out of 12 estimates moving lower. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 2.2%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $2.84 billion indicates 2.6% growth from the prior-year quarter.BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise BB&T Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | BB&T Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases.U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 18.

227,BBT,"M&T Bank Corporation (MTB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the opening bell. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected improve from the year-ago quarter.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.M&T Bank’s third-quarter 2017 results were hurt by lower trading and mortgage revenues along with higher expenses. The company also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to these factors. However, a decline in provision for loan losses and strong capital position were the tailwinds.The bank has delivered positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.9%.Over the past year, shares of M&T Bank have gained 16.9%, underperforming 27% growth recorded by the industry.M&T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&T Bank Corporation price-eps-surprise | M&T Bank Corporation QuoteWill the upcoming earnings release give a boost to M&T Bank’s stock? This depends largely on whether the firm is able to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Why a Positive Surprise Is LikelyAccording to our quantitative model, chances of M&T Bank beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for M&T Bank is +0.45%.Zacks Rank: M&T Bank carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Notably, per the consensus estimate, M&T Bank’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 19.4% from the prior-year quarter to $2.40.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the consumer front. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates are likely to boost the company’s NII.Relatively Stable Fee Income: The investment banking business witnessed improvement in the quarter and trust income is expected to rise, thereby providing some support to overall fee income growth. Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line.However, the overall volume of M&A has remained low during the quarter and the related fees are expected to decline slightly. Also, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from the mortgage banking segment and hence revenues are not expected to witness much improvement.Expenses to Trend Higher: Expenses are expected to trend higher in the upcoming release due to the company’s continued investments in several areas including operational infrastructure and technology.Activities of M&T Bank during the quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last seven days.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

228,BBT,"BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 18, before the market opens. The company’s tax equivalent net interest income (NII), one of the main sources of revenues, is expected to remain more or less stable sequentially.Even though, the fourth quarter witnessed an overall modest improvement in lending, per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loan growth has declined sequentially. Also, BB&T expects total loans, on an annualized basis, to decline sequentially, while core loan growth is anticipated to be in the range of only 2-4%.Moreover, despite a higher rate environment, the company projects core and GAAP NIM to be down 3-5 bps sequentially in the quarter on expectations of higher funding cost and asset mix change.Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for tax-equivalent NII of $1.68 billion for the fourth quarter shows marginal decline on a sequential basis. Also, management expects NII to remain stable from the prior quarter.Now, let’s check out other factors that might influence BB&T’s Q4 performance:Slightly Higher Non-Interest Income: Refinancing boom is nearing its end and higher interest rates are leading to reduced mortgage originations. This time seasonality also hurt mortgage banking revenues. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income of $102 million reflects a decline of 10.5% sequentially.Also, despite rising deposit balances, the company is not expected to register a significant increase in service charge on deposits. The consensus estimate for service charge on deposits is $179 million, stable from the prior quarter.However, BB&T is expected to register higher insurance income in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for insurance fees is $422 million, rising 6.3% from the prior quarter.Thus, overall, total non-interest income is projected to witness a slight sequential rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.17 billion.Stable Expenses: Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, BB&T expects expenses in the fourth quarter to remain flat on a year-over-year basis.Asset quality to support results: BB&T expects loan loss provision to match net charge-offs (NCOs) in addition to providing for loan growth. Also, management expects NCOs rates to remain in the range of 0.40-0.50%, up sequentially.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:According to our quantitative model, chances of BB&T beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are high.

229,BBT,"Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter and 2017 results, scheduled for Jan 18, are likely to witness a fall in trading income — one of the major revenue components. While this might majorly affect its earnings, an expected improvement in revenues from other segments, will likely offset the adverse impact to some extent.The decline in trading revenues will primarily be due to comparison with the prior-year quarter that witnessed higher volatility following the U.S. Presidential election results. But trading activities remained sluggish in the to-be-reported quarter.Several political and geopolitical developments, hike in interest rates, passage of the tax act and lack of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have incited volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates along with absence of specific catalysts have been a drag.Also, similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed income trading is expected to be largely responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fixed income trading revenues of $1.12 billion reflects a decline of 3.9% sequentially and 23.6% from the year-ago quarter. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity trading revenues of $1.92 billion indicates a rise of 1.5% from the prior quarter. But the same is expected to fall 1.7% on a year-over-year basis.Overall, fourth-quarter trading revenues are expected to be $2.86 billion, down 1.8% from the last quarter and 10.3% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Morgan Stanley’s fourth-quarter results:Underwriting fees to rise: Despite being the seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, fourth-quarter 2017 is expected to be an exception. Strong rally in the equity markets across the world might have propelled IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for Morgan Stanley. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $312 million reflects a surge of 38.7% from the prior-year quarter.Further, as the interest rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. As debt origination fees account for more than half of Morgan Stanley’s total underwriting fees, this will lead to strong gains. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for debt underwriting fees of $440 million reflects year-over-year growth of 4.5%.All in all, total underwriting fees are projected to witness a 14.4% year-over-year rise as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is $752 million.Modest rise in net interest income (NII): Rise in interest rates will likely lead to an increase in interest income. But overall loan demand remained weak — particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial and real estate. Therefore, NII is anticipated to witness slight growth.Advisory fees to show weakness: Slowdown in M&A activity in terms of deals closed despite significant new M&As announced in the fourth quarter will have an adverse effect on advisory fees. Thus, Morgan Stanley is not likely to be untouched. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advisory fees is $573 million, down 8.8% year over year.Expense control to support bottom line: Morgan Stanley’s cost savings plan — Project Streamline — is likely to result in lower expenses during the quarter. Also, as much improvement in revenues is not likely, chances of a big increase in compensation expenses is low. Notably, the company expects to lower its expenses by $1 billion in 2017.Adverse impact of new tax code: Following the passage of the tax act in December 2017, Morgan Stanley announced expectation of one-time charge of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter related to write-down of certain net deferred tax assets. However, this will partially be offset by nearly $160 million net discrete tax benefit, mainly related to “the remeasurement of reserves and related interest relating to the status of multi-year Internal Revenue Service tax examinations.”Therefore, the company is anticipated to record a net one-time charge of $1.25 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Morgan Stanley does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 77 cents reflects a 4.9% decline on a year-over-year basis.

230,BBT,"U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Jan 17, before the opening bell. The bank’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year.Benefits of higher rates, decent loan growth and relatively better performance of the consumer banking segment are anticipated to offset the slowdown in trading. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is projected to be $5.6 billion, up 3.9% year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that U.S. Bancorp will likely beat on earnings in the fourth quarter. This is because the company has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for a possible earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the stock is currently pegged at +0.13%. This is a significant and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for the company.Zacks Rank: The combination of U.S. Bancorp’s Zacks Rank of 3 and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.U.S. Bancorp delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 1.23%. Notably, U.S. Bancorp’s earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.1% from the prior-year quarter to 87 cents.U.S. Bancorp Price and EPS Surprise U.S. Bancorp price-eps-surprise | U.S. Bancorp QuoteFactors to Influence Q4 ResultsRise in net interest income (NII): Improvement in loan demand, particularly consumer loans, and rising interest rates during the to-be-reported quarter will likely support the company’s NII. Also, income from interest earning assets (average balance) are projected to rise nearly 1% to $421.3 billion.Non-Interest Income Likely to Improve:  Higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to have supported U.S. Bancorp’s fee income. Per the consensus estimate, trust and investment management fees are likely to improve 1.3% to $385 million on a sequential basis. Moreover, the trend of consumer spending was strong during the quarter, which is likely to boost the bank’s credit and debit card revenues by 6.2% sequentially to $327 million.Nevertheless, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment. The consensus estimate for mortgage banking revenues is $199 billion, down 6.6% sequentially.Expenses Might Trend Higher: While the absence of considerable legal expenses is a positive, increased investments in technology to improve digital offerings might escalate costs moderately. Also, there will be impact of the one-time charge that comes with the tax overhaul.Activities of U.S. Bancorp during the quarter to be reported were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence.

231,BBT,"Expected slump in trading business is likely to adversely affect The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings, to be reported on Jan 17. Nevertheless, benefits of higher rates and relatively better performance of the other segments — mainly investment banking — are anticipated to offset the trading slump.Being an investment bank, Goldman is exposed to extreme market volatility. Therefore, the company is likely to be affected by the subdued volatility experienced during the quarter.Several political and geopolitical developments, rising rate environment, passage of the tax act and absence of any significant progress on the regulatory reforms proposed by the Trump administration should have driven volatility. However, subdued inflation in the United States and marginal increase in long-term interest rates, along with absence of positive catalysts, have been on the downside.Similar to the last couple of quarters, lower fixed-income trading is likely to be primarily responsible for lower trading revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Institutional Client Services division, of which the major portion comprises fixed income revenues, reflects a decline of 13.9% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Goldman’s Q4 results:Investment Banking Fees Might Escalate: Continued momentum in investment banking business is anticipated to support bottom-line figures. Strong advisory and underwriting fees on the back of higher debt origination and equity issuances are likely to provide a boost to the top line. As the interest-rate hike is expected to continue, many U.S. companies have been raising fresh debt capital over the recent quarters to avoid higher interest rates later. Therefore, debt origination fees will lead to solid gains.Also, despite being a seasonally weak quarter for equity issuances globally, the fourth quarter turned triumphant. Strong rally in the equity markets across the globe might have boosted IPOs and follow-on offerings. So, the related fees are projected to increase for banks. Thus, Goldman is also likely to report an impressive quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for investment banking segment is projected at $1.6 billion, up 6.7% year over year.Rise in Net Interest Income: In addition to higher interest rates, a moderate improvement in lending — particularly in the consumer area — might perk up interest income.Strong Expense Management: Goldman completed an expense initiative during the first half of 2016 which translated into run-rate expense savings of around $1.6 billion in 2016. The bank is focused on enhancing its efficiency while maintaining strong franchise and investing in new opportunities. Thus, continuation of expense management will likely aid bottom-line expansion in the coming quarters.Adverse impact of new tax code: The tax reform might result in elevated operating expenses from one-time bonus payments, higher charitable contributions and investment losses from securities portfolio restructurings. Additionally, Goldman’s fourth-quarter 2017 results are likely to reflect a $5-billion negative impact triggered by the latest tax reform, which levied taxes on overseas income. Also, deferred tax assets (DTAs) will lose value due to tax cut.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Goldman does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Goldman is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Goldman carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

234,BBT,"The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan 17, before market open. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue growth, lower level of fee waivers, no provisions and a significant rise in total client assets and new brokerage accounts were among the positives. However, higher expenses and a decrease in trading revenues remained headwinds.Moreover, the company has a decent earnings surprise history as its earnings have not lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in any of the trailing four quarters. It delivered an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 2%.However, activities of Schwab during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. Thus, over the last 30 days, its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings remained stable at 41 cents. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 13.9%.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteNotably, Schwab’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 30.1% in 2017, outperforming the 19.5% growth for the industry it belongs to.Will the stock’s rally continue post fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fourth quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to be confident of an earnings surprise call.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is -0.72%.Zacks Rank: Schwab currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsAlthough, market volatility did not improve much in the fourth quarter when compared with the prior-year quarter, overall trading activities remained relatively decent. Moreover, Schwab opened 117,000 and 122,000 new brokerage accounts in October and November 2017, respectively, indicating that investors were somewhat interested in entering the market. Also, the company’s efforts toward lowering trading fees should have helped in adding more brokerage accounts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active brokerage accounts for the fourth quarter is 10,696, which is projected to witness year-over-year improvement of 5.3%.Thus, with the growth in brokerage accounts, trading revenues might have witnessed modest improvement in the quarter.Further, Schwab witnessed a rise in total client assets and average interest-earning assets in October and November on a year-over-year basis. This should reflect in the company’s results for the quarter as well.In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total client assets for the quarter is $3.3 trillion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 18.2%. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets for the quarter is $220 billion, which is expected to grow 6.3% year over year. Hence, higher assets, along with improvement in the rate scenario, should help Schwab experience higher net interest revenues during the quarter.Improvement in the two most important components of Schwab’s revenues should support overall revenue growth in the quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is projected to be $2.23 billion. The figure is expected to witness growth of 12.9% year over year.However, Schwab’s operating expenses have remained elevated since the past few quarters. Moreover, because of higher compensation and benefits cost, overall expenses are expected to remain high in the fourth quarter as well.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Jan 18.

235,BBT,"Comerica Incorporated (CMA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 16. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.The improving economic backdrop — stronger GDP growth, rise in consumer spending and increasing business spending — is likely to support Comerica’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $812.8 million for the fourth quarter reflects year-over-year growth of 12.6%.Further, management’s positive outlook for 2018 on the back of lower taxes and expectations of loan growth might lead the stock to new highs.Before we discuss why an earnings beat might also be in store, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the prior quarter.Comerica’s third-quarter 2017 results improved primarily due to a fall in expenses and higher revenues. It had surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the positives were partially offset by lower loan balance and provision for loan losses.Notably, the company boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 10.13%.These positive earnings surprises along with fundamental strength helped Comerica’s shares gain 23.2% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s 14.6% rally.Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Comerica Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Comerica Incorporated QuoteA Surprise in Store?Our proven model shows that Comerica has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the fourth quarter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.43%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earning assets of $66.4 billion reflects a marginal sequential growth.Higher Fee Income: Trend of consumer spending was strong during the fourth quarter, which is likely to boost Comerica’s non-interest income. Also, the improvement of investment banking and equity markets might lend further support. However, poor mortgage activity during the quarter is likely to partially offset the positive.Effective Cost Saving Initiatives: Expenses might continue to trend down in the upcoming release due to the company’s GEAR Up expense savings initiatives. However, costs are likely to be affected slightly by the tax overhaul.Credit Quality Might Improve: With the improvement in oil prices during the quarter, normalization of credit metrics is likely to continue. The consensus estimate shows 3.1% and 2.9% rise in non-performing assets and non-performing loans, respectively, on a sequential basis.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.BB&T Corporation (BBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.26% and a Zacks Rank of 1.
