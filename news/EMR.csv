10,EMR,"Emerson Electric (EMR) withdrew its $29 billion proposal to acquire Rockwell Automation (ROK), citing the target's ""continued unwillingness to engage in discussions about a potential combination"" of the makers of factory equipment.X ""Instead of engaging in constructive dialogue, the Rockwell board decided to let this unique and value-generative opportunity go unexplored,"" Emerson Chief Executive Officer  David Farr said in a statement Tuesday. ""We remain focused on accelerating core growth through new market penetration, technology innovation and strategic bolt-on acquisitions.""Emerson's decision ended a campaign that became increasingly aggressive earlier this month, when the St. Louis-based maker of manufacturing software and equipment released its third proposal on a day Rockwell was scheduled to address investors. Rockwell rejected the offer last week, saying Emerson's sweetened bid of $225 a share in cash and stock didn't outweigh the risks in bringing together the automation companies.Emerson for years has sought to bolster its offerings by adding the leading supplier of software and controls for assembly-line operations. Rockwell, based in Milwaukee, has maintained that it is better off alone with its successful Logix product that gives customers a single software platform to build on instead of learning multiple ones.Rockwell fell 2.4% to $186.51 in premarket trading in New York. Emerson rose 1.2% to $62.62.

The initial bid in August was for $200 per share.Emerson CEO David Farr wrote a letter to Rockwell earlier this month saying the deal ""would create a leader in the $200 billion global automation market.""But Rockwell said the deal is not in the best interests of its shareholders.""Emerson's proposal undervalues Rockwell Automation and its prospects for continued growth and value creation, presents significant long-term risk for Rockwell Automation's shareowners, and would create a company that is not well-positioned to compete successfully in the evolving market,"" the company said in a release.Rockwell shares were down 1.3% at 190.56 in premarket trading on the stock market today. Emerson climbed 1.1% to 61.00.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Rockwell makes motor and industrial automation, control and power systems.

(ROK) today confirmed that it recently rejected an unsolicited proposal from Emerson (EMR) received on October 10, 2017 to acquire Rockwell Automation for consideration consisting of $107.50 per share in cash and 225 million shares of Emerson common stock, valued at $107.50 per share based on Emerson's 30-day volume weighted average share price of $62.92 as of October 10, 2017. Rockwell Automation noted that the October 10, 2017 proposal followed an unsolicited proposal from Emerson on August 2, 2017 to acquire the Company for $200 per share, with approximately half of the consideration in cash and half in Emerson common stock.""Consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, the Board of Directors of Rockwell Automation carefully reviewed these proposals.

Nasdaq volume edged higher.In the stock market today, earnings winners were a dime a dozen as results from Cisco Systems (CSCO), NetApp (NTAP), NetEase (NTES) and Wal-Mart (WMT) impressed.Cisco Systems jumped 5% to 35.88.

He vowed to punish companies that move jobs outside the U.S. and promised to squeeze more money out of government contracts, citing his talks with Hewson, which he said cut the cost of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet by more than $700 million.""She's tough, but it worked out well I think for everybody,"" Trump said of Hewson.Before meeting with Trump, the executives split into working groups to explore policy changes on topics such as taxes and trade, regulation, infrastructure and the future workforce. Joining them in the breakout sessions were administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence; Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, Harris Corp. (HRS) CEO Bill Brown, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky and David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric (EMR), were among those who took part in the working group sessions with administration officials, who also included budget director Mick Mulvaney.  In a meeting with Cohn and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, business leaders including Corning (GLW) CEO Wendell Weeks and Nucor (NUE) President John Ferriola discussed indexing gasoline taxes to provide more money for transportation projects.Thursday's meeting grew out of Trump's December announcement of an advisory panel on manufacturing.Dow Chemical's Liveris, who is leading the panel, said afterward that he and the other executives were ""very encouraged"" by the pro-business approach being taken by the administration.Taking part in a session on the workforce of the future, Liveris said there must be a ""systemic fix"" to address the shortage of workers prepared for jobs requiring skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.""We have supply-side issues today,"" he said, ""half a million open STEM jobs that we can't fill. We need to fill them with Americans.""He also said community colleges need to provide more vocational training for ""the noble trades,"" which had been a priority of the Obama administration.Lockheed's Hewson told reporters that Trump is ready to take quick action on streamlining rules for businesses. ""It's very important that we reduce regulations, that we eliminate those that are burdensome that are unnecessary,"" she said.Ahead of the meeting, Business Roundtable, the lobbying group for U.S. corporate executives, sent a letter to Cohn laying out 16 regulations of top concern to its members. The letter touches on everything from the Affordable Care Act to net neutrality to environmental regulations — but also hints at CEO concerns about the economic impacts of Trump immigration and trade policy.Topping the Business Roundtable list is a 2015 move by the Environmental Protection Agency to tighten national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone, as well as EPA limits on new coal-fired power plants and expanded jurisdiction over state waters. The list also includes overtime regulations; Dodd-Frank provisions including CEO pay ratio disclosure, conflict minerals disclosure rules and margin requirements for uncleared swaps; and employer reporting and tax requirements under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the group is seeking expedited export controls and tightening eligibility and increasing exclusions for shareholder proposals.""While some of the listed regulations in isolation may not appear significant to growth, their cumulative effect has drained resources from innovation and job creation and directed them to non-value adding administrative and bureaucratic activities,"" said the letter, signed by Mark Costa, the chairman and CEO for Eastman Chemical (EMN) who leads Business Roundtable's smart regulation committee.At the same time, the letter said that as the administration ""considers new policies with regard to immigration or the expansion of 'Buy America' requirements, Business Roundtable stands ready to assist to prevent unintended consequences that would inhibit the ability for U.S. companies to drive economic growth and be globally competitive.""Trump has used previous meetings with companies to encourage corporate leaders to build their products in the U.S., offering tax breaks and lower regulation to bring down costs — and warning that he wants to raise tariffs on products produced overseas. The heads of labor organizations, automotive firms, national retail chains, drug companies, and airlines are all among the groups who have met with Trump in the West Wing in recent weeks.Neither Trump nor the CEOs indicated they had a detailed discussion of his plans to overhaul the tax code, which he has said he will deliver within weeks, or a border-adjustment tax proposal under consideration by House Republicans, which would shift the tax burden from exporters to importers.Republican leaders in the House, including Speaker Paul Ryan, argue a border-adjustment tax would benefit American manufacturing while providing revenue to make up for losses from reducing corporate tax rates. Several manufacturers, including Dow Chemical, are actively lobbying for the plan, which Trump has called ""too complicated."" Opponents, including net importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), oppose it and warn it will raise taxes on American consumers.

24,EMR,"It's so far been a good week for stocks on IBD's Dividend Leaders list. Prudential Financial (PRU) and Principal Financial Group (PFG) extended their multiweek advances to new highs. Invesco (IVZ) and Cummins (CMI) cleared brief consolidations and moved to new high ground.If current trading trends holds, next week may be even more promising. On IBD's current Dividend Leaders list, Toronto Dominion (TD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are each in the fourth week of flat consolidations. If they end this week without climbing to new highs, each will have formed a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: Use IBD's powerful research screens, based on CAN SLIM investing methodology, to quickly narrow your search for top dividend stocks.Cisco's chart is a bit more compelling than Toronto Dominion's. Cisco exited a 16-month consolidation in July, climbing to its highest mark in nine years before starting its current consolidation. The network gear maker's earnings aren't advancing in double-digit jumps like they were in 2007. But analyst consensus expects the company's revenue, which was 41% larger in fiscal 2016 than in 2007, is expected to leap 23% this year and 13% in fiscal 2018.Cisco's revenues this year are expanding as it acquires its way deeper into network security. Through August, it acquired Jasper and CliQr Technologies and CloudLock, for a total just shy of $2 billion. It is also reportedly eyeing Imperva, which analysts assess at around $1.5 billion. Cisco hoisted its dividend by 24% early this year, putting its yield at 3.3%.Earnings growth is expected to slow to 3% this fiscal year (ending in July), before rebounding to a 6% pace in 2018. Cisco plans to report its fiscal first quarter results after the market's close on Nov. 16.Toronto Dominion has been laboring in a flattish consolidation since late April. It briefly cleared a 45.84 buy point Sept. 6, then dropped 6% below that pivot. The pullback wasn't deep enough to trigger the 7% to 8% automatic sell rule. The drop below 10-week support occurred in above-average volume, but the volume increase also didn't trigger any alarms.Analysts expect that bank's earnings to fall 21% this year in a second straight decline, then bounce 6% in 2017. Revenue is projected to rise 11% and 16% in the next two quarters, accelerating to 19% growth for 2017. The bank's dividend currently yields 3.8%. The company plans to report fourth quarter results Dec. 1.Among other Dividend Leaders, Eaton (ETN) has formed a six-week flat base with 68.30 buy point. Emerson Electric (EMR) may be forming a handle on a nine-week cup base. Spectra Energy (SE), International Paper (IP) and Enbridge (ENB) are all four weeks into flat consolidations, which point to more possible bases maturing the week beginning October 17.Rising Optimism Among This Insurer's Clients Bode Well For Its StockCummins' Triple Threat: Dividend Growth, Cash Flow And Big Price GainsBank Stocks Have Work To Do, But Could Be Worth WatchingCisco Systems Spending $4 Billion In Mexico

25,EMR,"Applied Materials (AMAT) gave bullish guidance after mixed fiscal Q3 results, while Ross Stores (ROST) upped its profit outlook and Gap (GPS) offered cautious views after beating Q2 forecasts.Estimates: Analysts expect profit growth of 45.5% to 48 cents a share on 14% revenue growth to $2.84 billion.Results: EPS of 50 cents on revenue of $2.82 billion.Outlook: Q4 EPS of 61-69 cents vs. consensus of 48 cents. The midpoint of its revenue growth view implies $3.3 billion vs. consensus of $2.87 billion.Shares jumped 4.5% after hours on the stock market today.RELATED:Estimates: Consensus is for a 6% EPS gain to 67 cents on a 5% revenue rise to $3.13 billion.Results: EPS of 71 cents on sales of $3.18 billion, as comp sales rose 4%.Outlook: Q3 EPS of 52-55 cents, below consensus of 57 cents, on comp sales growth of 1%-2%. Q4 EPS of 73-76 cents, vs. views for 73 cents, on comp sales growth of 1%-2%.Ross raised full-year profit guidance to $2.69-$2.75, up from prior view of $2.63-$2.72. The midpoint of that outlook is a penny above Wall Street's view for $2.71.Earlier this week, rival TJX (TJX) gave disappointing guidance for both the third quarter and full year. The Street generally views the off-price sector favorably, as it has outperformed the broader retail market.Ross Stores shares broke out into buy range with a 59.78 entry point last month and rose 1.8% late Thursday after ending the regular session slightly overextended from buy zone. TJX closed down 0.5%.Estimates: Projections for an 8% decline in earnings to 59 cents a share on a 3% revenue slide to $3.78 billion.Results: EPS of 60 cents, minus items, on sales of $3.85 billion. Same-store sales fell 2%, with Gap's global comps down 3% and Banana Republic's down 9%. Old Navy comps were flat.Outlook: Full-year EPS of $1.87-$1.92, below consensus for $1.96.Despite topping Q2 estimates, shares dropped 0.9% late. The stock had closed up 1.65% at 25.88 and appeared to be approaching buy territory with a 26.05 entry after building a cup-with-handle base.Emerson Electric (EMR) agreed to buy Pentair's (PNR) valves and controls unit for $3.15 billion.

27,EMR,"General Electric (GE) doesn't just make jet engines, wind turbines and locomotives anymore. It now makes data centers -- that also happen to power airplanes, harness wind energy and ride the rails.Connecting these machines is a GE software platform that could underpin an Industrial Internet ecosystem resembling Apple's (AAPL) intertwining operating system, computers, phones, app store and music store.""All of our products are becoming data centers,"" GE Digital Chief Executive Bill Ruh told IBD in an interview.The iconic 124-year-old conglomerate, long synonymous with light bulbs and washing machines, is looking more like a tech company. As it shrinks its finance unit and sells its home appliance business, GE is also reinventing itself as a digital industrial company that could compete head-on with tech stalwarts like Microsoft (MSFT), plus traditional rivals like Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON) seeking to capitalize on the Industrial Internet.GE's transformation goes deep. The company is moving its corporate headquarters from Fairfield, Conn., to Boston, due in part to its need for ""technologically diverse"" talent. It also launched an ad campaign earlier this year to rebrand GE as ""The digital company. That's also an industrial company.""""There are still many people who think GE is locked in a time warp of what slow industrial companies used to be,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray. ""GE is breaking all of those molds.""GE estimates the Industrial Internet could be a $225 billion market by 2020, topping the $206 billion seen in the enterprise cloud computing market by then and the $170 billion in the consumer Internet of Things.While the Internet of Things includes connected refrigerators that can buy more milk online before it runs out, the Industrial Internet envisions machines that tell operators how to improve efficiency or fix a malfunction, potentially saving companies billions of dollars a year.For example, aircraft engines that GE makes with partner Snecma have sensors that measure vibration, temperature, heat, noise and emissions particles, Dray noted. They could send information while in flight to command centers, where the data are analyzed before the plane lands.If a fuel nozzle needs replacing, a maintenance team can wait for the plane at the destination airport with a new one. Similar capabilities exist on other equipment, like power generators and trains. Factories could also adjust output to match market demand or eventually operate totally autonomously.GE's Ruh said the company puts a data center at the heart of its locomotives, regulating operations like communications, safety and maintenance.""It's not a bolt-on,"" he said. ""It's a rethink of the products going forward.""In addition to building connected products, GE's tech push includes building virtual doppelgangers.GE says its engineers and scientists are creating ""digital twins"" of every machine delivered to customers that can continuously learn from their physical counterparts through embedded sensors, allowing GE to analyze the health of each machine without disrupting operations.And analyzing the flood of data GE products generate also represents an additional revenue opportunity in services. Last year, Japanese construction and mining equipment giant Komatsu (KMTUY) partnered with GE for Big Data analysis services for mining projects.GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said at GE's Minds+Machines developers conference last September that GE and other industrial heavyweights are evolving into hybrid technology/manufacturing companies.""If you went to bed last night as an industrial company, you're going to wake up this morning as a software and analytics company,"" Immelt said at the event.A cornerstone of the new GE is its Predix cloud-based operating system, which has an open architecture that allows industrial equipment customers to build on it. Ruh believes GE's Predix operating system software can become the standard for big manufacturers, as they continue to add intelligence to their equipment.""We think Predix can be embedded in every industrial machine that’s sold,"" he said.In February, GE launched an open-source digital industrial network, which includes dozens of global companies such as AT&T (T), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Verizon Communications (VZ), Japanese telecom giant Softbank (SFTBY), India's Tata Consultancy Services and China Telecom (CHA), among others.The list of partners has grown and includes more tech names. GE Digital recently teamed up with database software giant Oracle (ORCL) to develop and consolidate complementary offerings for the Industrial Internet.In April, GE released the first commercially available applications running on Predix. The Asset Performance Management suite includes a way to monitor equipment health, as well as a function designed to predict maintenance issues. Another feature to come out later this year is meant to help users manage the service life of their assets, maintenance costs and risk.Software is still a small part of GE's business -- about $6 billion of its $130 billion in annual sales. But it's growing at a 20% a year clip, Immelt said, and he's aiming for $10 billion in software sales by 2020, which would make GE one of the world's largest software vendors, and perhaps the largest industrial software maker.So does GE want to be the Microsoft of the Industrial Internet, with its Predix platform becoming as ubiquitous on large equipment as Windows is on PCs? ""Absolutely,"" Rue said.But Microsoft may actually want to be the Microsoft of the Industrial Internet. In April, CEO Satya Nadella spoke at Germany's Hannover Messe trade show, telling the gathered manufacturing executives that the software giant wants to take the lead in creating digital platforms for industry, citing work with Microsoft partners including aircraft engine maker Rolls Royce.""At this point, Rolls Royce is building a software product at the core value of what they do,"" he said. ""This is what we envision for every industrial company. We want to be able to create these platforms that can, in turn, create more digital technology from every industrial company.""Meanwhile, other industrial giants also have the capability to develop an open-standard operating system and will resist using something developed by archrival GE, even if it's an open architecture, noted Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.""All the major industrial companies are doing this to some level,"" he said in an interview. ""Siemens, Emerson (EMR), Honeywell already have sensors and gauges that collect data on pressure, temperature and such in their equipment. All of them are trying to elevate that.""Ruh says GE has an edge because it knows and accepts that it's transforming into a software and analytics company.""We think we're ahead of our competitors. We've invested for five years in cloud-based Internet-of-Things-focused architecture. Our competitors will be traditional competitors with software capabilities. They're still trying to catch up.""GE sees most tech companies as potential partners as it rolls out its industrial OS.“The reality is we could end up partnering with them,"" Ruh said. ""We don’t have to be competitors. Right now we’re working our way through that.”He hinted GE might partner with IBM (IBM), for example, with its Predix platform. Edward Jones’ Windau said that seems like a likely pairing.“IBM is coming from the top down, and GE is coming from the bottom up. Somewhere in the middle they meet each other,” Windau said.Not everyone thinks GE is succeeding in transforming into a high-tech industrial company. Asked about GE's digital thrust, Deutsche Bank senior analyst John Inch said, ""Talk is cheap. Just because GE says this doesn't mean it's so.""Inch noted that GE has often focused on change and has undergone various transformations over the years. There are positives, he said.""I'm not disputing that (GE) can make products better. But GE is not becoming a digital company. That's a fairly misguided notion,"" he said. ""It's an enormous company with power plant generators and locomotives. That footprint is never going to change.""It will also take two to three years to see if Predix can in fact evolve into an industry standard as GE hopes, Inch added.Still, as a first mover in the Industrial Internet, GE's deep knowledge of industrial manufacturing gives it an edge, said RBC's Dray.""It will be theirs to lose. Shame on them if anyone from the outside came in.""

29,EMR,"Health care information technology is growing fitfully -- hurt and helped by government policies. Still, HCIT software makers Cerner (CERN), Allscripts (MDRX), Athenahealth (ATHN) and Quality Systems (QSII) are expected to see their combined revenue rise more than 12% this year to $8.14 billion, and 11%, to $9 billion, next year, Wall Street analysts estimate.That's an achievement, since the biggest spenders -- hospitals -- are expected to increase their IT budgets by only 8% in 2016, up from 6%-7% in 2015, says analyst Matthew Gillmor with investment banker Robert W. Baird.That 8% increase will be shared with other companies that compete in HCIT, including IBM's (IBM) Watson Health, an analytics provider launched last year that is expected to ramp up to 2,000 employees. Another rival is Verona, Wis.-based, privately held Epic Systems, which employs some 8,500 workers and reportedly generated $1.7 billion in sales in 2014.The workforce for Kansas City, Mo.-based Cerner, the largest of the HCIT software pure plays, reached 22,000 employees last year after the company acquired Siemens Health Services for $1.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cerner's revenue to rise 13% in 2016, to $5.01 billion.HCIT growth faces a unique struggle, heavily influenced by policymakers in Washington, D.C., determined to expand and improve care while keeping a lid on patient costs. While federal rules have stimulated HCIT growth, they're also challenging hospitals' ability to keep up, compromising doctors and nurses' ability and time to provide care, some observers say.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which includes the Health Information Technology (HITECH) Act, established the Electronic Health Records Incentive Programs that reward and punish hospitals and doctors’ practices for the pace of their EHR transition. Then the Affordable Care Act of 2010, better known as ObamaCare, and most recently the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which became law in April, also hasten higher HCIT standards.In between the lawmaking, rule writers continue to draft implementation language that the federal director of HCIT standards in October called an ""IT bonanza.""This is good for the software vendors as they race to refine and sell Population Health software. PopHealth records expenses, tracks patient care and outcomes, incorporates patients’ evaluations of their care, parses data from similar patient populations, encourages communication between caregivers, and collects performance metrics throughout a hospital -- all intended to improve patient care while giving regulators tools to measure compliance.Cerner calls its PopHealth platform HealtheIntent and says it's used ""to address the growing demand, payer pressures and policy mandates organizations face today.""Those policy mandates are driving some doctors, nurses and hospital IT executives up the wall -- and some are pushing back.At this month's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where Cerner was among presenters, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees HCIT, tweeted: ""In 2016, MU as it has existed – with MACRA – will now be effectively over and replaced with something better.""In other words, the rules are changing again, maybe.MU is meaningful use, a protocol that has guided health care IT spending and systems development, and which the director of HCIT standards, Steven Posnack, has been implementing with a certification process under the auspices of MACRA. (At 39,010 words, MACRA is 10% the length of ObamaCare, which most consider complex.)In November, Dr. John Halamka went public with the case for changing or eliminating MU.""I’m likely going to violate many rules with this post,"" he prefaced in a blog post. He's chief information officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the 631-bed teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School. Halamka wrote in a post titled ""The Path Forward for Meaningful Use"" that MU had outlived its usefulness and is doing damage.""Stage 1 created a foundation of functionality for everyone,"" Halamka wrote. ""That was good.""Stage 2 tried to change too much too fast and required an ecosystem of applications and infrastructure that did not exist. ... Stage 3 makes many of the same mistakes as Stage 2, trying to do too much too soon. ...""Clinicians cannot get through a 12-minute visit, enter the necessary Stage 3 data elements, reconcile problems/allergies/medications from multiple institutions, meet the demands of the Stage 3 clinical quality measures, make eye contact with patients and deliver safe medical care. There needs to be a new approach.”As a veteran medical-surgical registered nurse at a big California hospital told IBD: ""We’re set up to fail.""This uncertainty helps explain why HCIT spending is growing slowly as hospital administrators hesitate to invest in systems requiring, as Halamka put it, ""infrastructure that did not exist"" under a ""meaningful use"" protocol of questionable viability for a MACRA law just 9 months old, with pending regulations yet to come.Two days after Slavitt's declaration to do away with MU under MACRA, his office issued its regular newsletter, ""What's Happening in Health IT,"" highlighting news of the ""Adopted 2015 Edition Criteria for Testing and Certification Under the Health IT Certification Program"" and ""In Preparation for Testing, ONC Publishes Certification Companion Guides,"" among other HCIT must-reads.""HCIT spending is still in the process of resetting post the MU bonanza, but the overall environment remains healthy,"" said Baird analyst Gillmor in a research note issued Jan. 8.He says the electronic health records replacement ""opportunity remains elusive,"" even though many hospitals need to get moving on their EHR efforts.Chicago-based HIMSS Analytics says only 4% of U.S. hospitals had achieved the most advanced Stage 7 of EMR proficiency as of Q3 2015, with 25% in Stage 6 and the remainder at the lower levels.""Replacement activity has been slow, and we expect this will continue in 2016,"" said Gillmor. ""CERN and Epic will continue to win the lion's share of replacements.""

54,EMR,"Chipmakers got some encouraging news in early March when the Semiconductor Industry Association said global chip sales in January rose 8.8% year-over-year to a record $26.28 billion — the biggest increase in almost three years.Part of the growth is due to a move by global wireless carriers to ramp up their networks in preparation for smartphones with faster processors. Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 5S was the first phone out with 64-bit processors. This year Google (GOOG) Android-based devices will get them too.As service provider networks upgrade to deliver faster speed and more capacity, more consumers will want to buy new smartphones, which in turn heightens demand for chips the service providers use.One of the beneficiaries is Cavium (CAVM), which designs systems on a chip for the networking, telecom, storage, wireless, security and video markets. Cavium is a ""fabless"" chipmaker, meaning it designs the chips and outsources the manufacturing process.The company has strung together five straight quarters of double-digit or better sales and earnings growth. Analysts expect the trend to continue in coming quarters.Outlook For The YearCavium is poised to benefit in 2014 from a ""strong core products design win pipeline, sizeable growth opportunities for new products, and greater customer diversification,"" Wedbush analyst Betsy Van Hees said in a report earlier this year.One of the main growth drivers this year should come from the wireless sector, which has benefited not only from a desire to upgrade networks but also from an improving macroeconomic environment.Cavium officials did not respond to requests for comment. On a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts, CEO Syed Ali said Cavium should see growth this year across all of its core enterprise, data center and service provider markets.""We expect to see very robust revenue growth in the wireless infrastructure market across macro base stations, radio network controllers and EPC (evolved packet core) at all our major customers in Asia and across the world,"" Ali said.Those customers include Samsung and Emerson Network Power, a unit of Emerson Electric (EMR). Cavium's biggest customer is Cisco Systems (CSCO), which accounted for 19% of sales during the 2013 fourth quarter. Cavium's Q4 sales to Cisco rose 8% from a quarter earlier to $15.7 million.""We were encouraged to see Cisco results beat expectations in the quarter,"" noted John Vinh, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities.Although Cavium guided revenue for Q1 2014 below estimates, partly due to softness in the telecom sector, Vinh said this outlook ""may prove to be conservative.""""Cavium indicated that one of its wireline customers has already indicated a recovery in Q1,"" Vinh noted. ""Additionally, booking trends at Cisco remain healthy, with revenue expected to be flat to up slightly.""Earnings Report AheadCavium is due to report Q1 results on April 30. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of 28 cents a share, up from 19 cents a year earlier. They expect revenue to rise 17% to $81.56 million.Financially, Cavium continues to rebound from a rough patch a couple of years ago, when it posted four straight quarters of lower sales and earnings beginning with the December 2011 quarter. Several chipmaker stocks had also slumped around demand weakness in parts of the industry.During Q4 2013 the company logged earnings of 31 cents a share, up 55% from a year earlier and a penny above consensus estimates. Revenue climbed 22% to $81.1 million, in line with views.On the conference call, CEO Ali said Cavium saw growth in the enterprise and data center markets, with strength in enterprise switches, routers and security equipment.""We saw continued strength in the wireless infrastructure market being offset by weakness in wireline and telecom markets,"" he added.Ali says Cavium's new 28-nanometer Octeon III product line has shown particular promise. This line has been ""sampled extensively"" to a wide range of customers and end applications, with thousands of shipments recorded.""We already have over 20 customers for this product and have won over 35 design wins in a very short time period,"" Ali said. ""We're especially pleased with winning a number of sockets that in the previous generation was being serviced by incumbent competitors.""Cavium also expects continued growth in security products, where it is a leader in the chip market.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cavium to report full-year EPS of $1.35 for 2014, up 32% from last year. EPS is seen rising 29% to $1.74 in 2015.The company ""should maintain share in the highest-growth portion of the communications processor market, thus outgrowing the peer group,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore noted.Competitors in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group include Broadcom (BRCM), Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) and Ambarella (AMBA). The group ranks No. 12 of 197 industries tracked and hit a record high on March 21. That day, Cavium shares touched a nearly three-year high of 47.47. The stock then slid, but rebounded more than 4% intraday Monday to near 44.

55,EMR,"Health care IT company Athenahealth has always seen itself as a disruptor.
"
56,EMR,"The company was among the first to provide practice-management software to doctors entirely through the cloud, rather than with installed systems.
"
57,EMR,"And since 2011, it's been running a project whose name is a demand: More Disruption Please.
"
58,EMR,"More Disruption Please is a kind of incubator, in which health IT startups pitch Athenahealth (ATHN) on why they offer a value-added service for Athenahealth's clients.
"
59,EMR,"Athenahealth picks its favorites and makes them available to clients through its network, in a system that's been compared with Apple's (AAPL) App Store.
"
60,EMR,"Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush plucked Kyle Armbrester fresh from Harvard Business School to develop the program. Armbrester, vice president of business development, spoke with IBD about how the project began.
"
61,EMR,"IBD: How did the More Disruption Please concept get started?
"
62,EMR,"Armbrester: When I came to Athena, we were one of the best technology-enabled services companies in the market. We're very good at building these technology-enabled services like Collector, Clinicals and Communicator.
"
63,EMR,"But what we noticed was twofold. One, we have a large distribution network with all of these providers and patients that were interconnected. And two, we were never going to be everything to everyone. We were never going to build a product that satisfied every need.
"
64,EMR,"And there was a fantastic business model from the consumer space of having an open-platform type concept. So we looked to Amazon (AMZN) and Salesforce (CRM) and Facebook (FB) and other titans of technology to take that particular model and align it with our cloud-based infrastructure.
"
65,EMR,"Our unique spin is that, because we take a percentage of net collection, we don't actually partner with technology companies. We partner with outcomes companies like ourselves. So to be a part of the More Disruption Please program, we give our partner the scorecard, and that scorecard shows how they're either driving more revenue to the doctors for doing the right things, or decreasing operational inefficiencies inside the providers' workflow, or helping to improve patient and provider outcomes.
"
66,EMR,"There are a few examples of that. We measure things like documentation time — how long the doctor is inside the EMR (electronic medical record). We want them out of the EMR as much as possible. We want them seeing patients, because we win and the doctor wins when that happens.
"
67,EMR,"We also look at things like charge-entry lag. When each charge gets captured, there's a lag time to when it actually gets put in the system, and there's a delay in payment because of that. So we work with our partners to attack some of these metrics that we know help our doctors perform clinically and financially in the best way possible.
"
68,EMR,"That's really the crux of the MDP program. We find best-in-breed cloud-based technologies, build free connectivity with them and then help them spread throughout our cloud-based network with our providers.
"
69,EMR,"IBD: How has your process evolved since you started? Have you learned as you've gone along about selecting the right companies?
"
70,EMR,"Armbrester: Yes, absolutely. When I showed up, we had no advance connectivity. The process for partnership was pretty ad hoc, and we built custom interfaces. It wasn't really scalable.
"
71,EMR,"I think the biggest changes have been twofold. One, we've built good awareness around the program inside the industry and inside our client base. Which is important, because our clients look at the MDP label as a mark of distinction for these partners, because they know that Athena is doing our jobs as stewards of the network, making sure that they're driving performance.
"
72,EMR,"Number two, and my real goal in wanting to come to Athena, is to drive more energy into the health IT space. Right before I decided to go into health IT I wanted to start something else — I always had a technology background — (then) got interested in health through a project I was working on, and quickly realized that the barriers to entry for scaling inside the health IT space were really on the connectivity side.
"
73,EMR,"You had large client-server systems, by Cerner (CERN) and Allscripts (MDRX) and others, to dominate the landscape, and interfacing with those custom systems in those large silos is impossible. For an entrepreneur to scale something that actually has a meaningful impact on physicians and patients and their workflow is really, really hard. So on a conceptual level, what I bought into with Jon (Bush), was his vision to lower that barrier to entry for entrepreneurs and to, like Justin Timberlake, 'bring sexy back' to HIT (health care IT).
"
74,EMR,"IBD: Can you give an example of a company you've selected through this process and how that's played out?
"
75,EMR,"Armbrester: One of our best partners is a company called Entrada. They do cloud-based, real-time speech-to-text, and cloud-based transcription.
"
76,EMR,"We give these small startup companies five clients right out the gate, and we run a beta (test) process. During the beta process we optimize them, we tweak them, we get the user experience right, we give them a scorecard (and) we measure results. This gives them an ROI (return on investment) that they can then go sell to our clients. They can say, ""Listen, we're moving documentation in time, we're moving same-day encounter close rates, and all these other metrics so you can get paid more quickly and see more patients efficiently.""
"
77,EMR,"With Entrada, we took them through that process. And after they move out of that, they move into something we call ""generally available."" That means they're open to anybody inside Athena to use.
"
78,EMR,"We launched them last year, and since then they've signed 45 accounts inside Athena. Some of those accounts have hundreds of doctors, some of them have two to three doctors. They're driving documentation time lower for all those practices. It's been fantastic to see them transform from a very small startup into a company that has dozens and dozens of clients in less than a year's time.Health care IT company Athenahealth has always seen itself as a disruptor.The company was among the first to provide practice-management software to doctors entirely through the cloud, rather than with installed systems.And since 2011, it's been running a project whose name is a demand: More Disruption Please.More Disruption Please is a kind of incubator, in which health IT startups pitch Athenahealth (ATHN) on why they offer a value-added service for Athenahealth's clients.Athenahealth picks its favorites and makes them available to clients through its network, in a system that's been compared with Apple's (AAPL) App Store.Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush plucked Kyle Armbrester fresh from Harvard Business School to develop the program.

256,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 1.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Emerson has an average positive surprise of 4.3% over the trailing four quarters, with two beats, one miss and one in-line earnings. We expect Emerson to score an earnings beat in the about-to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows an earnings beat for Emerson as it possesses the key components.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Emerson is +2.94% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 70 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. A positive Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise  Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteZacks Rank: Emerson has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The favorable combination of Emerson's Zacks Rank #3 and +2.94% ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Growth Factors this Past FactorEmerson continues to benefit from global infrastructure growth. Its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. Particularly, the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment is expected to act as a major catalyst for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by improving trends in the U.S. and Asian construction markets.Favorable trends in power, life sciences and improving MRO spending by oil and gas are expected to raise the top line for the quarter under review. Also, Emerson’s restructuring efforts, undertaken over the past few quarters, are likely to boost upcoming results. During the fiscal year, Emerson has offloaded three of its businesses – Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques – and generated $5.2 billion in proceeds.These restructuring actions better equips Emerson to cross-leverage its remaining portfolio and navigate between businesses. We believe the streamlined business structure will be conducive to earnings and margin expansion during the fiscal third quarter. During the previous quarter, Emerson’s total segment and EBIT margin increased 40 basis points (bps) and 30 bps, respectively, on a year-over-year basis, on the back of restructuring actions.This apart, the company is likely to see inorganic growth on the recent Pentair Valves & Controls buyout. Other acquisitions including Locus Traxx, PakSense and Blending & Transfer Systems business of FMC Technologies are expected to drive third-quarter fiscal sales as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.32% and a Zacks Rank #1.

257,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) recently wrapped up the purchase of Cooper-Atkins, boosting its inorganic growth further. Cooper-Atkins will strongly complement Emerson’s global cold chain business, which includes the Cargo Solutions business and the ProAct Services portfolio for supermarkets.Acquisition SpreeEmerson has been on an acquisition spree, of late. A month back, Emerson acquired Paradigm — a dominant provider of software solutions to the oil and gas industry — for $510 million. Paradigm will serve to deepen Emerson’s foothold in the upstream oil and gas market, as the former adds a series of subsurface software tools to the latter’s growing Automation Solutions portfolio.Last October, Emerson bought GeoFields, Inc., a global supplier of software and implementation services for the oil and gas industry, to strengthen its foothold in pipeline solutions for the oil and gas industry.We believe these buyouts will help the company create a solid core business model and drive profitable growth in the near term.The company’s actions have, it seems, met with shareholder approval. Emerson has outperformed the industry over the past six months, having appreciated an impressive 20.9% compared to the industry’s gain of 9.4%.Core Restructuring ActionsEmerson has been executing restructuring activities since 2015 to drive efficiency and growth. In fact, Emerson has slashed almost a third of the company’s sales during its two-year restructuring process.As part of its strategic portfolio restructuring, Emerson agreed to divest its ClosetMaid business to Griffon Corporation, back in September last year. In fiscal 2016, the company sold three of its businesses — Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques — and generated $5.2 billion in proceeds. These restructuring actions will enable Emerson to capitalize on its growth platforms.To maintain its scale of operations, the company has been making smaller, bolt-on acquisitions. Importantly, Emerson completed a $3.15-billion acquisition of Pentair’s valves and controls business in April. Integrating Pentair’s Valves & Controls business will enable Emerson to fortify its automation portfolio and help it offer complete valve solutions portfolio and sturdy service network, thereby elevating the company’s brand value. Emerson expects the acquisition to be earnings accretive in fiscal 2018 and contribute meaningfully to operating cash flow.Emerson maintains that it is on a constant lookout for small bolt-on and strategic acquisitions to bolster its sales to up to $20 billion and cash flow back to more than $3.2 billion over a span of next five years. To that end, Emerson intends to spend between $500 million and $1.5 billion on bolt-on acquisitions over the next couple of years. Last year’s outlay for the same came to about $1.5 million.Growth Drivers & Business ScenarioSolid order trends, successful multi-year restructuring initiatives, and momentum in both its platforms will likely prove accretive for the company’s sales. Emerson’s process automation business has finally got over its recession, with orders being strong and organic revenues growing. After the sale of a major chunk of this segment to Nidec Corporation, Emerson now generates more than 60% of its revenues from this segment. Improving industry trends bode well for this segment’s growth in the quarters to come.The company has been enjoying broad-based growth, driven by favorable trends in the energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets, as well as sturdy demand in the HVAC and refrigeration markets. Emerson anticipates increasingly favorable global market conditions and encouraging trends in capital spending, which will likely drive underlying sales growth across both platforms in the coming quarters.The ongoing recovery in oil and gas is likely to be the most significant profit driver for Emerson. In fact, it derives 50% of its total sales from the energy sector. With the addition of the Valves & Controls business, roughly 70% of sales in Automation Solutions will be generated directly from oil and gas customers. Emerson projects strong growth for this division, and as oil prices recover, the high level of exposure to energy end markets will likely boost the company’s earnings. However, should oil prices reverse course, there is a substantial risk that large energy projects could be delayed or canceled, which would have a material impact on the company’s operations.Also, a strong U.S. dollar, volatile industrial spending, and uncertainties in emerging and mature economies remain concerns for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.ABB has generated an average positive surprise of 11.7% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.H&E Equipment Services has generated three strong earnings beats in the trailing four quarters, for an average surprise of 34.7%.Caterpillar has a striking earnings surprise history for the same time frame, having beaten estimates all through for an average beat of 53.1%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Excluding the dilutive impact of the Valves & Controls acquisition, the same expanded 240 bps to 17.9% driven by leverage on higher sales and restructuring benefits.Net Sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions increased 1.6% to $1,483 million. Underlying sales for the segment recorded an increase of 4%. The same metric in North America rose 1% on account of solid demand for professional tools, which was partially offset by lower-than-expected demand for air conditioning.Asia witnessed strong growth once again as the underlying sales rose 17% year over year backed by solid demand for refrigeration and air conditioning in China. Underlying sales in Europe was up 5%, courtesy of strong demand in air conditioning and construction related markets.Under the platform, the Climate Technologies business grew 6.6% year over year to $1,128 million, while the Tools & Home Products unit declined 11.7% from the year-ago quarter to $355 million.Margins contracted 10 bps to 23.6% compared with the prior-year quarter.Other DevelopmentsDuring the reported quarter, the company signed an agreement to acquire the Tools and Test Equipment business of Textron for approximately $810 million.

ProSys’ unique technologies and proficiency are expected to enable Emerson to aid customers in improving plant performance, safety and profitability by optimizing human as well as automation resources.Also, the company completed the buyout of Cooper-Atkins, a leading technology company in foodservice markets. This buyout is anticipated to improve Emerson’s ability to cater to the needs of its cold chain customers, offering safe control of food as well as other temperature-sensitive products.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the second quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and long-term debt of about $3.4 billion.GuidanceIn light of the strong global demand trends, Emerson raised its outlook for fiscal 2018. It now expects net sales for the year to grow about 13%, with underlying sales to be up about 7%. These figures compare favorably with the prior projections of an increase of 11-13% and underlying sales increase of 5-7%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

259,EMR,"Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) has decided to acquire a leading technology company in foodservice markets, Cooper-Atkins. The buyout will serve to deepen Emerson’s ability to cater to the needs of its cold chain customers, offering safe control of food as well as other temperature-sensitive products. Financial details of the deal have been kept under wraps. The transaction is anticipated to close within next couple of months after fulfilling regulatory conditions.Cooper-Atkins’ added expertise, when combined with Emerson’s global cold chain business will expand latter’s capabilities in monitoring food, its preparation, as well as high-value shipments all through the supply chain to preserve freshness and quality.  Cooper-Atkins’ strong portfolio of automated temperature and monitoring solutions will augment Emerson’s ProAct Services portfolio for supermarkets and Cargo Solutions business.The AcquireeHeadquartered in Middlefield, CT, Cooper-Atkins offers temperature management devices and wireless monitoring solutions for foodservice, industrial as well as healthcare markets.

The company has taken a series of concerted efforts to develop a better brand with significant customer focus. Moreover, all of its segments garnered significant savings from restructuring actions, consequently adding to strength. Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has outperformed the industry in the past six months, having appreciated 17.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 7.2%.The company is on a constant lookout for small bolt-on and strategic acquisitions to increase sales to up to $20 billion and cash flow back to over $3.2 billion over a span of next five years. Some of the notable acquisitions made by the company in recent times include Pentair Valves & Controls and a business unit of Pentair plc. This apart, the company expanded global capabilities in fresh food monitoring, with the acquisitions of Locus Traxx and PakSense. These buyouts are likely to enable the company widen the scope of cargo solutions.Despite these positives, macroeconomic factors like sluggish economic conditions, recession and adverse conditions in the end markets are impeding growth. Further, prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, consequently marring the company’s prospects.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report) and Harsco Corporation (HSC  -  Free Report).

260,EMR,"Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) recently announced a new Plantweb Insight application for wireless pressure gauges, with easy usability features. This IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) application enables maintenance workers to gain a streamlined view of Rosemount wireless pressure gauges, thus enhancing safety.Per the company, the IIoT application is capable of delivering field data once per minute from a fleet of wireless pressure gauges. Notably, Plantweb Insight applications can easily be integrated with various WirelessHART gauges and remote field sensors. Also, it combines continuous real-time data offered by the company’s Pervasive Sensing strategies with predictive analytics to offer maintenance personnel latest process information, thus improving safety as well as energy management.Existing Business ScenarioEmerson has a solid track record of launching products and technologies to gain a competitive advantage over peers. Also, the company has an impressive history of clinching lucrative contracts in the energy infrastructure that proves conducive to its top-line performance. Strong MRO demand along with small and mid-sized projects focused on expansion and optimization of existing facilities has boosted the segment’s top line. Further, Energy, life sciences and chemical markets remain favorable.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 9.4%, significantly outperforming the industry’s increase of 1.1%.This apart, Emerson is optimistic about the prospects of its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it is witnessing improving trends in the United States, Europe and Asian construction markets.

At the Automation Solutions segment, favorable trends in petrochemical, power and life sciences and improving MRO demand is anticipated to boost growth. We believe selected investment opportunities coupled with positive trends in certain business areas offer Emerson decent growth opportunities.Despite these tailwinds, Emerson’s operations have suffered as a result of slow spending in general industrial markets. This, in turn, has affected the company’s order rates across the related segments and pulled down the sales figure. Additionally, it believes that sluggish economic conditions and prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets might take a turn for the worse on account of global economic uncertainty.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Enersys (ENS  -  Free Report), Energous Corporation (WATT  -  Free Report) and Capstone Turbine Corporation (CPST  -  Free Report).

262,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) recently acquired Paradigm, a dominant provider of software solutions to the oil and gas industry, for $510 million. Paradigm, when combined with Emerson’s Roxar software business, will enable Emerson to offer a best-in-class, end-to-end Exploration & Production (E&P) software portfolio offering.The acquisition will serve to deepen Emerson’s foothold in the upstream oil and gas market, as Paradigm adds a series of subsurface software tools to Emerson’s growing Automation Solutions portfolio.Emerson’s offerings will now range from seismic processing and interpretation to production modeling, thus elevating the company’s position as a strategic partner for both subsurface software, and surface systems and solutions to Oil & Gas industry. The technology that Paradigm’s offerings will bring will assist Emerson to improve efficiency, reduce costs and improve return on investment for oil and gas operators.Emerson has outperformed the industry over the past six months, having appreciated 11% compared to the industry’s gain of 3.9%. Emerson has been executing restructuring activities since 2015 to drive efficiency and growth. In fact, Emerson has slashed almost a third of the company’s sales during its two-year restructuring process. To maintain its scale of operations, the company has been making smaller, bolt-on acquisitions, including a $3.15-billion acquisition of Pentair’s valves and controls business in April.Emerson intends to spend between $500 million and $1.5 billion on bolt-on acquisitions over the next couple of years.

263,EMR,"After Emerson Electric Co.’s (EMR  -  Free Report) third takeover bid for automation products manufacturer — Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report) — was spurned by the latter last week, we believe it might be prudent for Emerson to completely abandon its suit. In fact, Emerson’s shares had risen 2.5% in the aftermath of the rejection, as investors’ concerns about an expensive deal that would overstretch Emerson’s finances eased.Let’s discuss the reasons why a deal between the two would, more likely than not, be a debacle, after we touch upon the relatively few arguments in favor of the same.“For” the DealEmerson is seeking to bolster its offerings by adding the leading supplier of software and controls for assembly-line operations. Doubtlessly, the deal would have added heft after Emerson’s CEO slashed almost a third of the company’s sales during its two-year restructuring process. To that end, it has been making smaller, bolt-on acquisitions, including a $3.15-billion acquisition of Pentair’s valves and controls business in April.Similar to the rationale for buying Pentair’s valves and controls unit, Emerson believes acquiring Rockwell Automation would help equip it better to bid for larger-scale automation projects. Emerson’s process automation prowess, and Rockwell Automation’s leadership in discrete automation would, no doubt, result in a truly hybrid, global player, and also a leader in the $200-billion global automation market.Emerson also believes the deal will create $6 billion in capitalized synergies, of which about a third would come from sales synergies, with the rest coming in the form of cost synergies.Rockwell Automation’s stock price has raced much ahead of Emerson in the past year. While Emerson has risen 13.2%, Rockwell Automation’s shares have soared a whopping 46.7% during the same time frame.Emerson has also underperformed the industry during the same time frame, with the industry gaining 15.9% over the past year.Rockwell’s Reality Check for EmersonAutomation firmly believes Emerson's sweetened bid of $29 billion doesn’t outweigh the risks involved in integrating the two industrial automation giants. It maintained that the unsolicited proposal undervalued the company, and also expressed concerns about the large amount of Emerson’s stock in the deal.Emerson's poor track record of integrating acquisitions was another nail in the coffin for its ambitions to create an industrial automation giant. Also, Moody's Investors Service estimates that the proposed deal implies leverage of five times the combined company's EBITDA — which is more than twice the median for major North American industrial companies (according to Bloomberg reports).Rockwell Automation said that the proposed merger would stunt its growth and hurt its competitiveness in the evolving market. The company noted that unlike Emerson, Rockwell Automation does not see this proposed deal as essential for its growth and expansion in the industrial automation and information market. Clearly, the company has great confidence in its strategic direction and ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation. It has witnessed bullish momentum this year, and its profit levels and margins are impressive.The company maintained that it is better off alone, riding on the success of the company’s Logix product which offers customers a single software platform to build on instead of learning multiple ones. Integrating it with Emerson's multiple offerings could be costly and could create grave customer disruptions.Summing UpWhile both companies have impressive long-term track records, Emerson has arguably been lagging in shareholder and operational returns over the past decade. Its shares have been largely inert, while shares of Rockwell Automation have virtually tripled over the time period.Rockwell Automation boasts superior margins and revenue growth, while Emerson is beset by repercussions of poor M&A decisions of the past. Emerson might have strategic rationale behind the deal, however a large multiple, high leverage, lack of earnings accretion, and a questionable track record, all hint toward abandoning the deal being a better choice.Both Emerson and Rockwell Automation currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Terex generated four outstanding beats over the trailing four quarters, for an outstanding average positive surprise of 135.9%.Caterpillar has a striking earnings surprise history for the same time frame, having beaten estimates all through for an average beat of 53.1%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

264,EMR,"Emerson Electric Company’s (EMR  -  Free Report) business segment, Emerson Automation Solutions, recently opened a customer-focused Solutions Center at its regional headquarters in Singapore. Additionally, the company announced a collaborative project with Singapore Polytechnic for advance training of the digital workforce of the future. The move aligns with Emerson’s motto of making Singapore, a hub for the delivery of Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and services for Asia Pacific’s customers.Inside The HeadlinesEmerson’s newly opened Solutions Center in Singapore will support the capabilities of industry’s most comprehensive Industrial IoT automation platform, Emerson’s Plantweb digital ecosystem. The Plantweb offering is comprised of standards-based software, hardware, intelligent devices, as well as services for securely implementing Industrial IoT-based solutions. The Solutions Center would display state-of-the-art multimedia technologies including virtual reality as well as augmented reality.The Emerson Solutions Center consists of two built-out plant settings. The company noted that the Digital Plant in the Center highlights a scaled-down replica of a process manufacturing facility for process control and safety systems as well as new Industrial IoT technologies. The Digital Plant enables simulation processes of a typical facility like an oil refinery, power plant, or a pharmaceutical plant. Further, the Central Control Room of the Solutions Center facilitates simulations of critical manufacturing processes for process optimization.Our TakeEmerson is poised to grow on the back of global infrastructure growth, as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending.  Moreover, environmental regulations are driving the need for new products, adding to its strength. Going forward, Emerson believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest catalysts.Presently, the company is optimistic about the prospects of its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it is witnessing improving trends in the U.S., Europe and Asian construction markets. The company believes this segment to on the back of a favorable outlook for global demand within its served markets. For the Automation Solutions segment, favorable trends in power and life sciences along with improving MRO spending by oil and gas customers is expected to boost growth. Going forward, Emerson has prioritized key areas of investment for each of its business segments to maximize growth.Furthermore, the company’s continuous launches of new products and technologies as well as restructuring efforts undertaken in the past few quarters are likely to benefit its results in the coming quarters. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 0.7% in past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 0.2%.However the fact remains that, continued softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, which in turn are hurting Emerson’s operations. Also, the company’s Industrial Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging and any improvements that it anticipated did not materialize, consequently adding to the challenges.This apart, Emerson is expected to incur high expenses related to the spinoff of Network Power, and proposed divestitures of the motors and drives as well as power generation businesses. Escalating costs, stringent competition and volatility in the capital markets also pose concern for in the near-term.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Alamo Group, Inc.

266,EMR,"The first-quarter earnings season is in full swing with around 267 S&P 500 companies already having reported financial numbers till Apr 27. Total earnings for these companies are up 25.1% year over year on 10% higher revenues, with 76.8% beating earnings estimates and 73.8% surpassing top-line expectations. Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the first quarter is anticipated to register improvement in earnings and revenues.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to rise 22.6% on 8.4% revenue growth, the highest quarterly earnings growth rate in the last seven years. This represents better growth projections from the previous quarter — courtesy of a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.Given the ongoing healthy scenario, it is quite natural that most sectors should deliver an impressive performance. In fact, per the above report, 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to end the first quarter with double-digit earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Only the Autos are expected to end the quarter with bottom line decline.One of these well-performing sectors is Industrial Products sector. According to the latest report, total first-quarter earnings of the sector participants are likely to increase 35.4% from the same period last year on 15.4% higher revenues.Currently, the sector seems to have regained its momentum after struggling with reduced investment in the energy sector, soft commodity prices as well as poor economic conditions in some developed and developing nations over the last few years. The rebound can be attributed to increased infrastructure spending as well as rise in manufacturing and mining activity.Given this backdrop, it will be interesting to wait and see how some of the Industrial stocks fare when the companies release their results on May 1.Emerson Electric Co.

267,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on May 1. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings came in at 58 cents per share, reflecting a beat of 7.4%.We expect Emerson to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Emerson has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Emerson has an Earnings ESP of +0.65%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Emerson Electric Co. Price and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Co. Price and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Co. Quote Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving Better-Than-Expected ResultsEmerson’s growth momentum is being driven by favorable trends in energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets as well as strong demand in the HVAC and refrigeration markets. Notably, thriving HVAC and refrigeration business, strength in the United States & Asia along with high infrastructure spending is expected to boost growth. The company also believes telecommunications infrastructure demand to continue being one of the strongest growth drivers, going ahead.Meanwhile, Emerson remains enthusiastic about its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment’s prospects as it is witnessing improving trends in the U.S., Europe and Asian construction markets. For the segment, the company’s focus on domains like human comfort, connected home, food quality, advancing energy efficiency at home and work is expected to prove conducive. Furthermore, favorable trends in power and life sciences as well as improving MRO demand are anticipated to boost the Automation Solutions segment’s growth. We believe selected investment opportunities coupled with positive trends in certain business areas offer Emerson modest growth opportunities.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues from the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment currently remains high at $1,495 million, reflecting growth of 19.4% sequentially. In addition, the company’s persistent focus on introduction of innovative products and technologies allows it to penetrate new markets and gain a competitive advantage over peers. This apart, Emerson’s restructuring efforts, undertaken over the past few quarters, are likely to benefit upcoming results.However, the fact remains that prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditures of its clients. This, in turn, has hurt the company’s order rates in power generating alternators and electrical distribution businesses. Also, currency fluctuations and escalating restructuring charges remain concerns.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.82% and a Zacks Rank #2.

268,EMR,"ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report) posted operational earnings per share of 31 cents for first-quarter 2018, reflecting an increase of 10.7% year over year. Notably, the reported figure came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong growth in revenues helped maintain earnings, however, this was somewhat offset by increase in total cost of sales.Quarterly revenues came in at $8,627 million, up 9.8% year over year. The top-line improvement can be attributed to increase in revenues in each of the company’s four segments. Revenues also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,272 million.Segmental Revenues in DetailsElectrification Products (up 9% year over year to $2,494 million):  Strong market demand in the United States, Europe, and Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) drove revenues. Orders were up 10% year over year to $2,786 million owing to strong demand across all regions.Robotics and Motion (up 15.1% to $2,209 million): Sales grew steadily on strong execution of the order backlog. Orders of this segment moved up 18% year over year to $2,579 million on a year-over-year basis backed by reported growth across all segments and regions.Industrial Automation (up 22.9% to $1,859 million): Orders recorded impressive growth of 26% year over year to $2,117 million. The uptick was owing to service and selective investment in mining and specialty marine vessel solutions.Power Grids (up 1.4% to $2,385 million): Higher orders contributed to the segment’s revenue growth. Orders increased 7% to $2,480 million, mainly owing to several large orders that include an order for an HVDC link between the UK and France.ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ABB Ltd QuoteTotal orders came in at $9,772 million, up 16.3% year over year. The metric also improved 6% on a comparable basis backed by strong base orders across all regions. While base orders grew 15% on a year-over-year basis, large orders amounted to 10% of the company’s total orders. The order backlog at the quarter-end totaled $23.7 billion (up 3% year over year).On a geographic basis, demand was high in the European countries with moderate overall growth and well-timed large capital investments. Also, orders displayed excellent growth in the Americas driven by increased demand from general industries as well as some improvement in process industries. Evidently, total orders were up 1% in the Americas, supported by rise in demand from general industries and some improvement in process industries. Meanwhile, the strong performance was witnessed in the AMEA region owing to order growth in China, India and the United Arab Emirates.Book-to-bill ratio at the end of the first quarter was 1.13, up from 1.07 in the comparable quarter a year ago.Operational earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) in the quarter under review rose 12% year over year to $1,060 million.Next Level Strategy: Stage 3 In third-quarter 2016, ABB had launched the third stage of the revamped version of its “Next Level Strategy” that focuses on three areas namely — profitable growth, relentless execution and business-led collaboration. The third stage calls for restructuring the company’s divisions into four market-leading entrepreneurial businesses, unlocking its full digital potential, accelerating momentum in operational excellence and enhancing the company’s brand.ABB also restructured its business into four segments — Electrification Products, Robotics and Motion, Industrial Automation and Power Grids — effective Jan 1, 2017.Furthermore, the company has taken a number of transformational actions to position itself for profitable growth. In 2017, it completed and announced several important acquisitions, divested certain businesses and executed business model changes. Additionally, ABB shifted its core operations to higher growth segments, thus boosting its competitiveness and de-risking the portfolio. In order to unlock its digital capabilities, ABB had also announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) to shore up its capabilities in the industrial internet market by combining cloud technology with industrial digital technology.Meanwhile, ABB remains optimistic about the White-Collar Productivity savings program, which has surpassed expectations since its inception. Last year, the company achieved its cost-reduction target under this $1.3 billion program.LiquidityABB’s cash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2018 were $4,162 million compared with $5,562 million as of Mar 31, 2017. Total long-term debt declined to $5,285 million at the quarter-end, from $6,709 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Acquisitions and PartnershipsABB recently completed the acquisition of B&R — an independent provider dealing in product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation globally. This buyout is expected to bridge the gap between machine and factory automation and create an exclusive, comprehensive automation portfolio for clients across the world.Also, the acquisition of the data-transmission business of the KEYMILE Group should enable ABB to expand its communication networks business footprint in the industrial, transportation and infrastructure domains. It is anticipated to add reliable communications technology offerings to the company’s diverse portfolio, thus helping ABB fortify its foothold in digital electrical grids.ABB also announced its intention to acquire GE Industrial Solutions for $2.6 billion. This buyout would further strengthen the company’s position in Electrification by improving market access in North America.To ConcludeOver the long haul, ABB believes that all its three major markets namely, utilities, industry and transport & infrastructure, hold great potential. The company expects utility customers to invest further in transmission and distribution projects and renewable sources like solar and wind.Going ahead, the company expects to gain from high investments in ultra high voltage DC power transmission projects in mature and emerging markets and continuing investments in maintenance of aging electric infrastructures.However, ABB has been facing strong structural headwinds in its largest business — Power Grids — over the past few quarters. This trend is likely to continue in 2018.ABB carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include A. O.

269,EMR,"Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with its recent growthmomentum driven by favorable trends in energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets. The company is also enjoying strong demand in the Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC), and refrigeration markets.We believe that the company’s restructuring activities, solid portfolio of new products and accretive acquisitions will continue to boost growth, going ahead. Buoyed by these growth drivers, Emerson’s shares have had an impressive run on the bourse over the past year. Shares of Emerson have gained 11%, better than the industry’s growth of 4.4%. We expect the company’s remarkable traction across markets to continue in the quarters ahead.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the key factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company an attractive proposition for investors right now.Factors to ConsiderEmerson is well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. Also, the company’s products such as data centers, manufacturing plants and office buildings are considered to be the key components for building infrastructure. Furthermore, environmental regulations are driving the need for new products, thus adding to the company’s strength. Moving ahead, Emerson believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest growth drivers.Moreover, the company is optimistic about the prospects of its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it is witnessing improving trends in the United States, Europe and Asian construction markets.In light of the recent optimistic order trends and recovering end markets, the company raised its sales and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. The Automation Solutions segment is expected to witness solid growth driven by favorable trends in power and life sciences. This apart, thriving HVAC, refrigeration markets and construction-related demand in key-end markets is anticipated to boost growth for the company.Meanwhile, the company’s focus on launching new products and technologies enables it to gain a competitive advantage over peers. Further, Emerson’s impressive track record of clinching lucrative contracts in the energy infrastructure will prove conducive to its top-line performance, going ahead. We believe that such lucrative contract wins are likely to remain key growth drivers in the coming days. In addition, the company’s restructuring activities from last few years have helped it to drive efficiency and growth.Strong MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) services demand, along with small and mid-sized projects focused on expansion and optimization of existing facilities, have also contributed to the company’s top line. This apart, the company is on a constant lookout for small bolt-on and strategic acquisitions to restore its sales, up to $20 billion and cash flow back to over $3.2 billion, over a span of next five years. Going ahead, strategic acquisitions and positive trends in certain business areas might prove conductive to the company.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space are A.

270,EMR,"Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report), a leading business service provider, recently announced that it will close the processing plant in Laurel, MD, by the end of June to improve its overall efficiency levels. Consequently, the company will lay off about 47 employees, who would be given an opportunity to apply for other suitable positions within the organization or be provided with severance packages along with optional healthcare and job placement services.The processing plant was mostly utilized for cleaning and repairing uniforms for delivery to customers. With the closure of the processing facilities, the plant would be converted for uniform pick-ups and drop-offs. The company revealed that the decision was purely based on its operating economics and was in no way related to the viability of the region. Management believed that the company had ample space at separate locations to economically process the uniforms, thus offering it an opportunity to be more efficient.   Cintas aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base to include fresh business segments. It also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. From fiscal 2010-2017, revenues of the company have witnessed a compounded annual growth rate of 5.2%.In addition, Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.With a diligent execution of operational plans, Cintas has outperformed the industry with an average return of 8.5% in the last three months compared with a gain of 6.4% for the latter. It has also raised its earlier guidance for fiscal 2018 on favorable growth trends. Revenues are currently expected in the range of $6,365 million to $6,430 million, up from $6,325 million to $6,400 million anticipated earlier. Earnings from continuing operations are expected to be between $5.39 and $5.46 per share, up from earlier projections of $5.30-$5.38.Cintas has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

271,EMR,"Shares of Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report) were up 2.59% to close at $193.61 on Nov 16  as rival Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) sweetened its offer to acquire the former at $225 per share. This translated the total value of the deal to $29 billion. Notably, this is Emerson’s third attempt to acquire the automation products manufacturer. The consideration would be paid in $135 per share in cash and $90 per share in Emerson shares. Per Rockwell Automation, it would review the unsolicited proposal with its financial and legal advisers to determine the course of action that will be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.On Oct 31, the company had announced the rejection of Emerson Electric’s takeover bid valued at around $28 billion. This led to the stock hitting a 52-week high of $210.72 as the decision impressed the market and analysts. In fact, the company’s share price has outperformed the industry as well as the S&P 500 year to date. While the stock has been up 44.1% the industry grew 41.1%, and the S&P 500 gained 16.9%. Meanwhile, shares of Emerson Electric have rallied 5.8%, underperforming its industry’s growth of 11.3% and the S&P 500’s gain of 14.8%.A Dogged SuitorOn Oct 10, Emerson Electric had offered Rockwell Automation $107.50 per share in cash and 225 million shares of its common stock. The stock was valued at $107.50 per share based on Emerson Electric's 30-day volume weighted average share price of $62.92 as of Oct 10, 2017.Markedly, this was Emerson Electric’s second attempt to acquire Rockwell Automation. On Aug 2, 2017, Rockwell Automation had refused Emerson Electric’s proposal to acquire it for $200 per share, with approximately half of the consideration in cash and the other half in common stock.Why Is Emerson Pursuing Rockwell Automation?Earlier, Emerson Electric’s management had stated that they considered only small bolt-on acquisitions. However, from these proposals it is evident that the company is now trying to diversify businesses and reduce exposure to volatile energy prices.Therefore, Emerson Electric sees Rockwell Automation as a way to get more exposure to the rapidly growing automation business. One of Rockwell Automation's advantages is its advancement in internet of things, which allows different devices and systems to communicate with each other over the internet.Even though Emerson Electric has been trying to expand its software portfolio through acquisitions, it clearly lags Rockwell Automation's offerings that help industrial businesses connect their technology operations. While, Emerson has a market capitalization of $37.77 billion, Rockwell Automation has a market capitalization of $24.72 billion. The deal, if comes through would create a leader in the $200 billion global automation market, with best-in-class portfolio of automation solutionsWhy Were the Previous Offers Shunned?Following a review of the proposal and consultation with financial and legal advisors, Rockwell Automation’s board of directors had concluded that Emerson Electric's offer was not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders. Also, as per reports, Rockwell Automation had concerns about the large amount of Emerson Electric’s stock in the deal. Furthermore, it was apprehensive regarding Emerson Electric's poor track record of integrating acquisitions.Is Rockwell Automation Better Off Alone?Rockwell Automation targets long-term revenue growth of 6-8%, double-digit EPS growth, returns on invested capital (ROIC) of more than 20% over the long term and cash flow of around 100% of adjusted income. These goals are likely to be supported by the company’s strategy of diversifying sales streams by expanding products portfolio, solutions and services as well as global presence.Additionally, it aims at achieving growth rates in excess of the automation market by expanding the company’s served market, strengthening competitive differentiation, and catering to a wider range of industries and applications.Going forward, Rockwell Automation’s new Connected Enterprise (CE) integrated supply chain management system is anticipated to be a catalyst. Meanwhile, the company is increasing the number of industries, applications and geographies as well as improving investments to expand the value of CE. With average profitability well above the corporate average, CE sales are expected to be an integral part of Rockwell Automation’s incremental growth and boost margins over the next few years.In the trailing four quarters, Rockwell Automation outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 9.1%. In fact, the company has been witnessing upward revisions in the last 30 days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up 1% to $7.39 for fiscal 2018 and 5% to $8.26 for fiscal 2019. A positive trend in estimate revisions reflects investor’s optimism on the company’s bright prospects.Rockwell Automation currently has a ROA of 12.3% while the industry's ROA is 12%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets. Moreover, the company’s trailing 12-month ROE of 38.7% is higher than the industry’s ROE of 34.8%, reflecting the company’s tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds. In addition, Rockwell Automation’s long-term earnings growth rate of 11.8% is a positive.Thus, substantiating the fact that Rockwell Automation is better placed on a stand-alone basis. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same sector are Caterpillar Inc.

272,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) sweetened its earlier bid forautomation products manufacturer Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report), in an effort to bring its hesitant rival to the negotiating table and form a new giant in industrial automation.Yesterday, Emerson wrote to Rockwell Automation, proposing a takeover at $225 per share, with 60% in cash and 40% in stock, for a total consideration of about $29 billion. The price represents a premium of 19% to Rockwell Automation’s closing stock price of $188.73 on Wednesday.The latest bid follows Rockwell Automation's repeated rejections of Emerson's overtures for much of this year. In late October, we came to know that Rockwell Automation had already rejected two offers from Emerson, including a $215 per share, $27.6 billion takeover offer made in the same month.Rockwell Automation’s stock price has raced much ahead of Emerson in the past year. While Emerson has risen 8.9%, Rockwell Automation shares have soared a whopping 47.6% during the same time frame. Responding to the offer, Rockwell Automation said it would review the unsolicited proposal with its financial and legal advisers, and then determine the course of action which is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.Emerson believes there is undeniable strategic, operational and financial merit to the merger, and it would benefit customers, employees and shareholders alike.Emerson's strength lies in process automation — enabling power plants and factories in mining, cement and other such sectors operate more efficiently. Rockwell Automation is a prominent player in the so-called discrete automation — helping assemble component parts to manufacture products like household appliances, automobiles and computer systems.Doubtlessly, an Emerson and Rockwell Automation merger would create a leader in the $200-billion global automation market.Emerson believes the deal will create $6 billion in capitalized synergies, of which about a third would come from sales synergies. Sales synergies would include more comprehensive in-house product offering, an increased win rate in large projects and complementary products for cross-selling opportunities and channel pull through.The rest would represent cost synergies, including corporate and public company costs, materials costs, administrative and channel efficiencies, manufacturing optimization, and more effective R&D and engineering costs spread across a broader base.Emerson also stated that the deal would create $8 billion of total value ($62 per share) for Rockwell Automation shareholders.Rockwell Automation had earlier insisted that it was better off alone, with its booming Logix product that offers customers a single software platform to build on, instead of learning multiple ones which Emerson offers. The company thinks that the common platform is vital to its commercial success and integrating it with Emerson's multiple offerings could be costly and create customer disruptions. Also, the company had great confidence in its strategic direction and ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation.Some analysts see definite value in the deal, however, and the latest bid would surely be difficult for Rockwell Automation to reject outright.Both Emerson and Rockwell Automation currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader space include Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Terex generated four outstanding beats over the trailing four quarters, for an outstanding average positive surprise of 135.9%.Caterpillar has a striking earnings surprise history for the same time frame, having beaten estimates all through for an average beat of 53.1%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.     Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

273,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) recently clinched a $40-million automation systems and services contract for Novo Nordisk’s drug manufacturing facility in Clayton, North Carolina. Per the contract, Novo Nordisk’s biggest project, $2-billion plant, will leverage Emerson’s Project Certainty methodologies and automation technologies to fight the global diabetes epidemic.   The DealUnder the deal, Novo Nordisk will implement elements of Emerson’s Project Certainty approach, which would trim down project complexity as well as meet its tight-project schedule. The company’s integrated portfolio of automation technologies and services, including Syncade manufacturing execution system and DeltaV distributed control system would help to reduce Novo Nordisk’s project costs as well as accommodate late-stage project changes. This apart, Emerson will also offer smart automation technologies including measurement instrumentation and valves.Other Notable Contract WinsEmerson has a solid history of winning valuable contracts in the energy infrastructure field that are conducive to its top-line performance. Some notable contracts secured include a $20-million design-build contract for an automation project from San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and a contract for Biomass-Fueled Plant in United Kingdom. Such contract wins remain a key growth driver for the company.Existing Business Scenario Emerson is well-positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth, as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending.  Moreover, environmental regulations are driving the need for new products, adding to its strength. Going forward, Emerson believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest growth drivers.Currently, the company remains optimistic about the prospects of Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it has been witnessing improving trends in the U.S. and Asian construction markets. Also, the company remains bullish on its Automation Solutions segment backed by favorable trends in power and life sciences as well as improving MRO spending by oil and gas customers. Furthermore, the company’s restructuring efforts, undertaken over the past few quarters, are likely to benefit its upcoming results.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 5.2% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 2.9%.Despite these positives, prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, which in turn are hurting Emerson’s operations. The company’s Industrial Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging and the improvements which Emerson anticipated did not materialize, thereby compunding the challenges.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are Columbus McKinnon Corp. (CMCO  -  Free Report), Kennametal Inc. (KMT  -  Free Report) and Alamo Group, Inc. (ALG  -  Free Report). While Columbus McKinnon and Kennametal sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Alamo Group carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Columbus McKinnon has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 15.4%.Kennametal has outpaced estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 20.6%.Alamo Group has surpassed estimates twice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.1%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Moreover, it will fortify the company’s presence in European markets.Furthermore, Emerson anticipates this buyout to boost cash flow immediately while predicts earnings accretion in fiscal 2019 (ending September 2019). Snapshot of Emerson’s Inorganic InitiativesWe believe that the above-mentioned transaction is consistent with Emerson’s policy of acquiring meaningful businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines.Prior to this buyout, in May 2018, Emerson signed an agreement to acquire Aventics — a Germany-based leader in pneumatics technologies. The buyout will cost the company €527 million and will be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 (ending September 2018). In January 2018, the company completed the buyout of ProSys Inc., thereby adding new technologies to its Operational Certainty initiative while the buyout of Cooper-Atkins has been strengthening its portfolio of cold chain technology.It’s worth mentioning here that acquisitions/divestitures have a positive impact of 8% on sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended March 2018). Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksWith a market capitalization of nearly $43.8 billion, Emerson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Favorable construction markets in North America, Asia and Europe also bolstered revenues.Emerson anticipates increasingly favorable global market conditions and positive trends in capital spending, which will likely drive underlying sales growth across both platforms in the coming quarters. Solid order trends, successful multi-year restructuring initiatives, and momentum in both its platforms should prove accretive for the company’s sales. Emerson’s cost-cutting initiatives are also likely to boost the company’s profitability significantly, going forward.However, volatile industrial spending, and uncertainties in emerging and mature economies remain concerns.Emerson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Atlas Copco AB (ATLKY  -  Free Report), IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report) and Altra Industrial Motion Corp.

277,EMR,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) recently announced its decision to discontinue operations at the company’s commercial water heater plant, based in Renton, WA. The Renton plant, a producer of commercial gas and electric specialty water heaters, electric boilers and hot water storage tanks currently employs about 55 people.The company intends to relocate the production of commercial electric water heaters, storage tanks and boilers to its plants at McBee, SC and Lebanon, TN, with effect from June 15. Transfer of the production to the larger McBee and Lebanon facilities should allow the company to leverage economies of scale as well as shift its production nearer to its commercial engineering resources. Additionally, it is likely to allow A.O. Smith to achieve cost synergies in terms of rental savings. This is because McBee and Lebanon facilities are owned by the company. Moreover, it plans to consolidate the customer service function of the Renton facility into its existing customer care facility at Ashland City, TN.Existing Business ScenarioA.O. Smith has been witnessing strong demand for its products in China, and boilers and commercial water heaters in the United States, which has accelerated its growth momentum. Also, the company’s defensive replacement market, which accounts for majority of the North American water heater and boiler volumes, has been on an uptrend in the recent quarters.Moreover, the company’s multiple capital expenditure initiatives like construction of new water treatment manufacturing facilities and capacity expansion are expected to pave the way for its higher brand recognition and top-line growth. Meanwhile, the company has been leveraging to capitalize on the long-term investment opportunity in India, which is one of the rapidly developing economies of the world. Further, the acquisition of Aquasana, the residential water treatment company, has been adding to the company’s strength.Notably, in the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 11.3%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.2%.The company believes that the U.S. residential water heater volumes will shoot up in 2018, on the back of new construction and expansion of replacement demand. Further, U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes are also likely to go up this year, driven by strong demand for electric units as well as pre-buy of electric units in advance of regulatory change-driven price increase. These trends bode well for the company’s growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space include Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Co.

In February 2018, the company added a new product — the Tollok TLK 136 — to its locking devices product line. With a compact design, various options are available for these devices. Also, in the same month, it introduced 390 Series MatTop Chain for use in the pharmaceutical, metal container, beverage and food industries. This new product will help in lowering risks related to chain failure as well as help in reducing downtime and product damage.The company’s digital enterprise strategy, DiRXN has been strengthening its Process & Motion Control segment since its launch in May 2017. The platform integrates innovative Industrial Internet of Things and e-commerce technologies to help customers to improve productivity.Additionally, Rexnord’s business expansion initiatives through the acquisition of meaningful businesses have proved beneficial over time. The Centa Power Transmission buyout — completed in February 2018 — is anticipated to create new business opportunities in the couplings market and enhance its revenue generation capability by approximately $100 million. It will be integrated with the Process and Motion Control segment.For fiscal 2018, Rexnord anticipates its core sales to grow in mid-single digit (earlier expectation was of low-to-mid single digit) and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to be $381-$387 million (previous expectation was $375-$385 million).In the last 30 days, the company’s earnings estimates for both fiscal 2018 (ending March 2018) and fiscal 2019 (ending March 2019) was revised upward by one brokerage firm. The Zacks Consensus Estimate currently stands at $1.34 for fiscal 2018 and $1.72 for fiscal 2019, reflecting an increase of 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, from their tallies 30 days ago.Rexnord Corporation Price and Consensus  Rexnord Corporation Price and Consensus | Rexnord Corporation QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the industry are ESCO Technologies Inc.

279,EMR,"In a bid tostrengthen itscold chain management capabilities, Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) recently announced the finalization of an agreement with Weiss Instruments, LLC. The financial details of the deal were kept under wraps.In the United States, Weiss Instruments has operated as Dixell controls’ third-party authorized distributor for more than two decades. Per the latest deal, Emerson will now directly serve the customers of its Dixell products by streamlining their access to Dixell-branded controls in the market of North America. Notably, the agreement does not include the core Weiss Instruments business, which will continue to operate as an independent company. Emerson’s Dixell brand is touted as a global leader in microprocessor based electronic regulation, pressure and humidity controls for commercial refrigeration as well as air conditioning. Therefore, the direct offering and management of the Dixell products is likely to boost Emerson’s ability of delivering portfolio of products and solutions to its customers.Notably, the direct management of the Dixell products will facilitate the delivery of comprehensive customer solutions leveraging the portfolio of customized, packaged, programmable as well as building-level controls in the refrigeration, healthcare, air conditioning, industrial, and pharmaceutical industries.Our TakeEmerson’s growth momentum is being driven by favorable trends in energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets as well as strong demand in the HVAC and refrigeration markets. Also, the company is expected to benefit from global infrastructure growth as its core businesses hold dominant positions in the markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 5.6%, outperforming 0.2% growth recorded by the industry. Meanwhile, the company remains enthusiastic about the prospects of its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it is witnessing improving trends in the United States, Europe and Asian construction markets. For instance, in the fiscal first quarter of 2018, the company’s Automation Solutions platform reported an impressive 30.8% year-over-year growth. For the Automation Solutions segment, favorable trends in power and life sciences, and improving MRO demand are anticipated to boost growth.Additionally, the company remains focused on launching new products and technologies that enables it to broaden its customer base and gain market traction. This apart, Emerson has a solid history of clinching lucrative contracts in the energy infrastructure, which is a positive for the company.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Cimpress N.V (CMPR  -  Free Report) and Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report). While Applied Industrial Technologies and Cimpress sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Deere & Company carries a Zacks Rank #2.

280,EMR,"A few industrial products companies are gearing up to report quarterly numbers on Nov 6. The Q3 earnings season has crossed the halfway mark, with about 406 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, reconfirming broad-based expectations of strong earnings (as on Nov 3).Earnings of these companies (accounting for 85.4% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 7.5% on 6.3% higher revenues. Of these companies, 73.9% have surpassed earnings estimates, with 66.7% coming ahead of revenue estimates.As per our latest Earnings Preview, dated Nov 3, data projects that the total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are now on track to be up 6.5% from the year-ago period, on 5.6% higher revenues.The Industrial Products space (which accounts for about 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization) is anticipated to chart one of the highest earnings growth rates this quarter amongst all Zacks sectors. In fact, its earnings are on track to be up 18.5% in this quarter, on 4.4% higher sales compared with the last year.The Industrial Products stocks have performed well in the past six months, with the sector gaining roughly 10.6%, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 7.9%. We believe growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Further, there are economic indicators which point toward a sturdy operating environment for the industry. Industrial production — which measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors — grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, led by robust growth in mining and utilities. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing, automotive and commercial construction markets, as well as steady growth in new job additions. These indicators bode well for the industry.Let’s have a look at how some industrial companies are positioned, ahead of their scheduled announcements tomorrow:Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) is engaged principally in the worldwide design, manufacture, and sale of a broad range of electrical, electromechanical and electronic products and systems. The company has a modest earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates twice over the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 5.5%. In the last reported quarter, the company reported in-line earnings.Our quantitative model does not hint at a likely earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company this quarter. This is because for a possible earnings beat, the company should have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold). The combination of Emerson Electric’sZacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes an earnings beat unlikely this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 80 cents. (For more details, read: Emerson to Report Q4 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards?).It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Emerson Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteWe expect Zebra Technologies Corporation (ZBRA  -  Free Report) to outperform estimates in its quarterly results. Zebra Technologies makes direct thermal and thermal transfer bar code label printers, receipt printers, instant-issuance plastic card printers and secure identification printing systems, related accessories, and support software. The company has a remarkable earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 5.8%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 4.1%.Our quantitative model hints at a likely earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #2 company in the upcoming results. For the to-be-reported quarter, the company’s Earnings ESP of +1.74% and a favorable Zacks Rank #2 indicate that Zebra Technologies’ earnings will likely beat estimates this quarter. Its Most Accurate estimate of $1.75 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zebra Technologies Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Zebra Technologies Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Zebra Technologies Corporation QuoteMulti-Color Corporation (LABL  -  Free Report) is one of the largest producers of printed labels for branded consumer products in the United States. The company has a modest earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 3.9%. In the last reported quarter, the company crushed estimates by 7.5%.We do not predict Multi-Color to likely beat expectations this quarter. Though the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.11.Multi-Color Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Multi-Color Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Multi-Color Corporation QuoteKeep an eye on our full earnings articles to see how these players finally fared in quarter.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

281,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 7. In the quarter to be reported, the company is expected to report strong revenues in Industrial Automation business, which constitutes nearly two-third of its total revenues.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. Ithas a decent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 5.5% in the trailing four quarters.We expect Emerson to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Emerson has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Emerson has an Earnings ESP of +0.14%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected Results Emerson is now poised to grow on the back of global infrastructure growth, as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending.  Moreover, environmental regulations are driving the need for new products, adding to itsstrength. Going forward, Emerson believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest growth drivers.The companyremains bullish on its Automation Solutions segment backed byfavorable trends in power and life sciences as well asimproving MRO spending by oil and gas customers. The company’s focus on domains like human comfort, connected home, food quality, advancing energy efficiency at home and work and sustainability augur well for its Commercial and Residential Solutions segment. Furthermore, its restructuring efforts, undertaken over the past few quarters, are likely to prove conductive to its upcoming results.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Automation Solutions segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains high at $2,874 million compared with third-quarter revenues of $2,440 million. This apart, the company’s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to be conducive to its core business, going forward. The company is likely to see growth on the recent GeoFields buyout. Other acquisitions including Pentair Valves & Controls, Locus Traxx and PakSense are expected to drive fourth-quarter fiscal sales as well.However, the fact remains that prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets is anticipated to affect both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, which in turn may hurt Emerson’s operations. Furthermore, a strong U.S. dollar, volatile industrial spending, along withuncertainties in emerging and mature economies remain concerns.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Columbus McKinnon Corporation (CMCO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.76% and a Zacks Rank #1.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.71% and a Zacks Rank #2.Rockwell Automation, Inc.

282,EMR,"Shares of Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report) jumped 7.39% to close at $200.82 yesterday as the market appreciated its rejection of rival Emerson Electric Co.’s (EMR  -  Free Report) latest takeover bid valued at around $28 billion. Notably, Rockwell Automation was among the top gainers among the S&P 500 members yesterday.Rockwell Automation started the day trading at $210.66, going on to hit a 52-week high of $210.72. So far this year, the company’s share price has outperformed the industry as well as the S&P 500. The stock has gained 49.4% while the industry recorded a rise of 35.3% and the S&P 500’s increase of 14.2%.Meanwhile, Emerson Electric gained 15.6%, underperforming its industry’s gain of 17.2% but faring better than the S&P 500’s rise of 14.2%.The Shunned ProposalsEmerson Electric’s latest proposal was made on Oct 10, per which Rockwell Automation would receive $107.50 per share in cash and 225 million shares of Emerson common stock. The shares were valued at $107.50 per share based on Emerson Electric's 30-day volume weighted average share price of $62.92 as of Oct 10, 2017.This was Emerson Electric’s second attempt to acquire competitor Rockwell Automation. The company had earlier refused Emerson Electric’s proposal made on Aug 2, 2017 to acquire it for $200 per share, with approximately half of the consideration in cash and half in Emerson common stock..Rationale Behind the OfferEmerson Electric’s management had earlier indicated that they considered only small bolt-on acquisitions. However, from these proposals it is evident that the company is now trying to diversify businesses and reduce exposure to volatile energy prices.Emerson Electric sees Rockwell Automation as a way to get more exposure to the rapidly growing automation business. One of Rockwell Automation's advantages is its advancement in internet of things. It is the technology that allows different devices and systems to communicate with each other over the internet. Even though Emerson Electric has been trying to expand its software portfolio through acquisitions, it clearly lags Rockwell Automation's offerings that help industrial businesses connect their technology operations.Why Did the Deal Fall Through?Following a review of the proposal and in consultation with financial and legal advisors, Rockwell Automation’s Board of Directors concluded that Emerson Electric's offer is not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders.Per reports, Rockwell Automation has concerns about the large amount of Emerson Electric’s stock in the deal. Further, it is apprehensive regarding Emerson Electric's poor track record of integrating acquisitions.Why Rockwell Automation is Better as a Standalone CompanyRockwell Automation continues to target long-term revenue growth of 6-8%, double-digit EPS growth, return on invested capital (ROIC) of more than 20% over the long term and cash flow of around 100% of adjusted income. These goals will be supported by Rockwell Automation’s strategy of diversifying sales streams by way of expanding products portfolio, solutions and services as well as global presence. The company also aims to achieve growth rates in excess of the automation market by expanding its served market, strengthening competitive differentiation, and catering to a wider range of industries and applications.Rockwell Automation’s new Connected Enterprise (“CE”) integrated supply chain management system will be a catalyst. The company is increasing the number of industries, applications and geographies, as well as improving investments to expand the value of CE. With average profitability well above the corporate average, CE sales will be an integral part of Rockwell Automation’s incremental growth and boost margins over the next few years.Rockwell Automation outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 10%. The company has been witnessing upward revisions in the last 90 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up 0.3% to $6.77 for fiscal 2017 and 0.7% to $7.33 for fiscal 2018. A positive trend in estimate revisions reflects optimism over the company’s bright prospects.Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Rockwell Automation, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Rockwell Automation, Inc. QuoteRockwell Automation currently has a ROA of 9.2%, while the industry's ROA is 3%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets. Also, Rockwell Automation’s trailing 12-month ROE of 22.3% is higher than the industry’s ROE of 15.9%, reflecting the company’s tactical efficiency in using shareholders’ funds. Further, the company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 11.3% holds promise.Thus, Rockwell Automation is better placed on a stand-alone basis and deserves a better offer.Rockwell Automation currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks worth considering in the same sector are Lakeland Industries, Inc.

285,EMR,"We issued an updated research report on Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report) on Mar 12. The company’s earnings are projected to grow 12.40% in the next three to five years.This machinery company has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a market capitalization of approximately $3.2 billion.Let’s delve deeper and discuss why investors should consider adding Rexnord’s stock to their portfolio.Share Price Performance and Earnings Estimates Revision: Rexnord’s financial performance has been impressive in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 12.55%. In the last quarter, the company’s earnings and sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 37% and 2%, respectively. In the last three months, market sentiments have been positive for Rexnord, with its shares yielding 26.2%. This hike clearly outpaces 2.7% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Underpinning the favorable sentiments reflects positive revisions in earnings estimates for the stock. In the last 60 days, seven brokerage firms have raised estimates both for fiscal 2018 (ending March 2018) and 2019 (ending March 2019). Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.34 for fiscal 2018 and $1.72 for fiscal 2019, representing growth of 7.2% and 11.7% from their respective tallies, 60 days ago.Healthy Business Prospects: Rexnord currently operates in two business segments — Process and Motion Control, and Water Management. Globally recognized brands in the Process and Motion Control segment are Rexnord, Rex, Falk and Link-Belt while brands in the Water Management segment are Zurn, Wilkins, VAG, GA, Rodney Hunt and Fontaine. These products are used in various industries like mining, food & beverage, aerospace, non-residential construction and global water infrastructure.For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates strengthening demand from global food & beverage, global process industries and global commercial aerospace end markets to benefit Process & Motion Control segment. Further, industrial distribution business in the United States & Canada, Europe and Rest of the World will grow. For the Water Management segment, healthy demand from non-residential and residential construction markets of the United States and Canada, as well as water and wastewater infrastructure markets of China and Rest of the World will be beneficial.Inorganic Activities — Key to Profitability Enhancement: Over time, acquired assets have helped Rexnord leverage benefit from easy penetration into markets and expanded product offerings. Meanwhile divestments of non-strategic business have aided better usage of resources and profitability improvement. In this regard, the acquisition of Cambridge International Holdings and divestiture of non-strategic RHF product line in fiscal 2017 are worth mentioning.The company efforts continued in fiscal 2018 as well. In the third quarter, the company acquired World Dryer Corporation. The World Dryer’s hand dryers strongly complement Water Management segment’s Zurn business. The combined businesses will offer superior products to commercial building owners. In the fourth quarter, the company completed the buyout of Centa Power Transmission, to be integrated with the Process and Motion Control segment. This asset will create new business opportunities in the couplings market and is anticipated to enhance Rexnord’s revenue generation capability by approximately $100 million.Solid Near-Term Prospects, Long-term Targets: Rexnord believes that its business segments will benefit from synergistic benefits from acquired assets in fiscal 2018. Moreover, its digital enterprise strategy, DiRXN — this platform integrates innovative Industrial Internet of Things and e-commerce technologies to help customers to improve productivity — will enhance performance of the Process & Motion Control segment. Also, the company stands to gain from its supply-chain optimization and footprint-repositioning programs.Core sales in the year are anticipated to grow in mid-single digits (higher than the previous expectation of low-to-mid single digits). Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are projected to be $381-$387 million (above $375-$385 million expected earlier).Over the long term, Rexnord targets core growth to be in mid-single-digit and profit margin to be roughly 30%. Free cash flow is predicted to be in excess of net income. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected within 30-35% and 20-25% for the Process & Motion Control and Water Management segments, respectively.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the industry are ESCO Technologies Inc. (ESE  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) and Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

286,EMR,"In a bid to strengthen its foothold in pipeline solutions for oil and gas industry, Emerson Electric (EMR  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of GeoFields, Inc.GeoFields is a global supplier of software and implementation services for the oil and gas industry and the deal will also create new opportunities for Emerson. Further, the company will be able to expand its digital portfolio with the GeoFields software and services for pipeline integrity management, which would offer asset reliability solutions for its customers. The terms of the acquisition were kept under wraps.Acquisition RationaleEmerson already enjoys a stronghold as a comprehensive pipeline solutions provider globally and believes this buyout will enable it to expand portfolio of pipeline solutions for the oil and gas industry. This acquisition will also allow Emerson to perform risk modeling and high consequence area (HCA) risk analysis, collect critical integrity data as well as prioritize pipeline integrity-related maintenance activities.Emerson’s Expansion PlansEmerson intends to pursue growth and expansion of core business through acquisition of companies or assets that aid growth of its service offerings. Some of the notable acquisitions made by the company in recent times include Pentair Valves & Controls, Locus Traxx and PakSense. While the integration of Pentair’s Valves & Controls business will allow Emerson to bolster its presence in control, isolation and actuation business lines, the Locus Traxx and PakSense buyouts are likely to help widen the scope of cargo solutions.Our TakeRecently, the company has reshuffled and streamlined business, in order to optimize operational structure as well as boost profitability. In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 8.6%, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 7.5%.For the company’s Automation Solutions segment, favorable trends in power and life sciences and improving MRO spending by oil and gas customers is anticipated to boost growth. Moreover, the company is bullish about the prospects of its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it is witnessing improving trends in the United States, Europe and Asian construction markets. The company believes this segment to grow in mid-single-digit growth in fiscal 2017, on the back of a favorable outlook for global demand within its served markets.In view of recent optimistic order trends and recovering end markets, Emerson raised outlook for fiscal 2017 for the third consecutive time.However, macroeconomic factors like sluggish economic conditions, recession and adverse conditions in the end markets are impeding growth for the company. Further, prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, consequently marring Emerson’s prospects.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Barnes Group, Inc.

287,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with third-quarter 2017 results. Although the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, net sales surpassed the same and grew 9.9% year over year. The company is anticipated to continue the momentum on the back of recent optimistic order trends and recovering end markets. Emerson Electric raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 in the last quarterly report, reflecting these  catalysts.We believe an outstanding performance in the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions bode well for growth for rest of the fiscal year. Further, the company, which has a strong foothold in a diversified global manufacturing and technology industry, has several growth drivers working in its favor. Read on to find out the key drivers for this company right now.Existing Business ScenariosEmerson Electric experienced impressive revenue growth in the third quarter, driven by sound performance from the Automation Solutions backed by robust, broad-based demand in power, life sciences and chemical markets. Moreover, the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform experienced 7% increase in net and underlying sales, supported by robust demand in global HVAC and refrigeration markets.In light of the strong momentum, Emerson Electric anticipates net sales for the year to grow about 5% compared with prior projections of flat net sales.Recently, the company has reshuffled and streamlined businesses, which will optimize operational structure and bolster profits. Favorable trends in power and life sciences are expected to boost growth for the company. Emerson Electric’s small bolt-on and strategic acquisitions has also aided it to secure a place in the core market and grab greater market share. In the last few months, the company completed acquisitions of Pentair Valves & Controls, Locus Traxx, Blending & Transfer Systems business of FMC Technologies and PakSense. We believe these buyouts will supplement the company’s top-line performance, going forward.However, the company’s operations have been suffering as a result of slow spending in general industrial markets. This has affected the company’s order rates across the related segments and pulled down the sales figure. The company’s Industrial Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging and any improvements that Emerson anticipated did not materialize, consequently creating pressure.The industrial products sector is highly competitive; dominated by several multinational; behemoths like Emerson, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Barnes Group, Inc. (B  -  Free Report) and Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report). In order to boost competency Emerson makes expensive research and development investments. However, this increases its aggregate debt burden moving ahead.Further, the company believes that sluggish economic conditions and prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets may take a turn for the worse due to global economic uncertainty. Such tough economic conditions and dwindling order rates do not bode well for the company, thereby adding to the company’s challenges.Considering the growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we believe its focus on business streamlining along with positive trends in certain business areas offer Emerson Electric modest growth opportunities.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

291,EMR,"As the ultimate step in its strategic portfolio restructuring, Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) inked a definitive agreement to divest its ClosetMaid business to Griffon Corporation for $260 million.ClosetMaid, a leader in home organization and storage systems, currently comes under Emerson’s Commercial & Residential Solutions business, and has been a strong revenue driver for the company in the last few years.Emerson anticipates the deal to conclude within 30 days, with minimal impact on net earnings and earnings per share. Roughly $180 million will be generated in after-tax cash proceeds from the divestment.Portfolio Repositioning Over the last two years, Emerson has been executing restructuring activities to reposition its portfolio, and fuel efficiency and growth. The company is following a strategic plan to transform itself into a leaner and more focused organization by offloading certain segments of the business.In fiscal 2016, the company sold three of its businesses — Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques — and generated $5.2 billion in proceeds. Notably, Network Power was sold to Platinum Equity for $4 billion. Post this transaction, Emerson retained a subordinated interest in Network Power. Similarly, Japan-based Nidec took over Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses to Nidec Corporation for a purchase price of $1.2 billion.These restructuring actions will enable Emerson to capitalize on its growth platforms. The company’s actions seem to have been received well by investors, as its shares have appreciated 13.4% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry average of 7.2%.Acquisitions GaloreEmerson has been also active in the acquisition space, in order to expand its core business. In April, the company completed the acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls — a business unit of Pentair plc — for $3.15 billion.Integrating Pentair’s Valves & Controls business will enable Emerson to fortify its automation portfolio and help it offer complete valve solutions portfolio and sturdy service network, thereby elevating the company’s brand value.The company is now aggressively working on integrating the Valves & Controls business. It expects the acquisition to be earnings accretive in fiscal 2018 and contribute meaningfully to operating cash flow.Further, the company entered into an agreement to buy leading non-intrusive corrosion monitoring technologies provider — Permasense Limited. The Permasense buyout will fortify Emerson’s footprint in the integrity and corrosion management solutions business. It also expanded its global capabilities in fresh food monitoring, on the back of the Locus Traxx and PakSense buyouts. These two companies will assist Emerson in facilitating steady and safe control of food, and other temperature-sensitive goods.During first-quarter fiscal 2017, the company acquired Blending & Transfer Systems business of FMC Technologies — a leading provider of systems for lubricant, grease, fuel and chemical blending applications — to fortify its presence in advanced flow measurement and control technologies. We believe these buyouts will help the company create a solid core business model and drive profitable growth, going forward.Industry Trends & Impact on EmersonEmerson’s process automation business has finally got over its recession, with orders turning positive in late 2016 and organic revenues growing. After the sale of a major chunk of this segment to Nidec Corporation, Emerson now generates more than 60% of its revenues from this segment. Improving industry trends bode well for this segment’s growth in the quarters to come. In fact, Automation Solutions platform reported an impressive 12% year-over-year growth in net sales in third-quarter fiscal 2017.Going forward, ongoing recovery in oil and gas is likely to be the most significant profit driver for Emerson.The company is enjoying broad-based growth, driven by favorable trends in energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets, as well as strong demand in HVAC and refrigeration markets. Emerson expects increasingly favorable global market conditions and positive trends in capital spending, which will likely drive underlying sales growth across both platforms in the coming quarters.Emerson Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteSumming UpIn light of the recent optimistic order trends and recovering end markets, Emerson recently raised its outlook for fiscal 2017 for the third consecutive time.

Additionally, Emerson will control BP’s fiscal metering systems on all North Sea assets that are crucial for custody transfer, fiscal accounting and taxation purposes. Our TakeEmerson’s growth momentum is being driven by favorable trends in energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets as well as strong demand in the HVAC and refrigeration markets. Moreover, the company is well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has returned 14.6%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.5%. Meanwhile, Emerson’s Automation Solutions platform has been witnessing particular momentum in recent times. Strong MRO demand along with small and mid-sized projects, focused on expansion and optimization of existing facilities, has boosted the segment’s top line as well.Furthermore, the company remains optimistic about the prospects of its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it is witnessing improving trends in the United States, Europe and Asian construction markets. For instance, in fiscal first quarter, the company’s Automation Solutions platform reported an impressive 30.8% year-over-year growth. For fiscal 2018, the company expects underlying sales at this segment to grow in the 4-6% range, on the back of a favorable outlook for global demand within its served markets.Additionally, the company has a solid history of clinching lucrative contracts in the energy infrastructure field that proves to be conducive to its top-line performance. We believe that such lucrative contract wins will remain a key growth driver, going ahead.

295,EMR,"Machinery company Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has completed acquiring Haan, Germany-based Centa Power Transmission. Financial consideration of the buyout has not been disclosed. The deal was originally announced on Jan 8.Centa Power specializes in manufacturing flexible couplings and shaft lines. Its products are mainly used by customers in the industrial, marine, power generation and rail-end markets. It carries its operations through subsidiaries in 10 countries and with the help of nearly 450 employees.In a month’s time, Rexnord shares have declined 2.9%, less than the fall of 8.7% recorded by the industry it belongs.

The company anticipates that this acquisition will strengthen its business portfolio and create new business opportunities in the couplings market. Centa Power assets, in combination with Rexnord’s digital productivity platform — DiRXN — and related products, will be an added benefit.The company anticipates the buyout to enhance its revenue generation capability by approximately $100 million. Rexnord’s Inorganic Initiatives: A BoonOver time, Rexnord has worked toward improving its business portfolio and enhancing profitability by acquiring meaningful businesses or disposing of non-core assets. In this regard, the acquisition of Cambridge International Holdings and divestiture of non-strategic RHF product line in fiscal 2017 (ended March 2017), as well as the buyout of World Dryer Corp. in third-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017), is worth mentioning.World Dryer’s hand dryers strongly complement Water Management segment’s Zurn business, which provides water-efficient plumbing products. Notably, acquisitions and divestitures had a positive impact of 1% on revenues in the third-quarter fiscal 2018.For fiscal 2018 (ending Mar 31, 2018), Rexnord anticipates benefiting from the innovation of new products, strengthening of demand in end markets, benefiting from its supply-chain optimization and footprint-repositioning programs and synergistic benefits from acquired assets.

(AZPN  -  Free Report) to deliver asset optimization software solutions along with global automation technologies and operational consulting services. The collaboration will enable customers to optimize production as well as drive operational excellence.The latest partnership is likely to leverage AspenTech’s broad suite of asset optimization software and Emerson’s capabilities in automation engineering services & software, large-scale project execution and consulting services as well.Currently, AspenTech’s asset optimization software supports Emerson’s Project Certainty and Operational Certainty initiatives by creating value across all asset lifecycle phases in capital intensive as well as complex projects.

Also, it will offer optimization strategies that are based on real-time data and advanced analytics, facilitating business improvements in production, and in areas like reliability, safety as well as energy management.Our TakeAt present, Emerson’s growth momentum is being driven by favorable trends in energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets as well as strong demand in the HVAC and refrigeration markets. Moreover, the company is well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. Going forward, it believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest growth drivers.In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has returned 15.8% outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.6%. The company is very enthusiastic about the prospects of its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it is witnessing improving trends in the United States, Europe and Asian construction markets. For instance, during the first quarter, the company’s Automation Solutions platform reported an impressive 30.8% year-over-year growth. For fiscal 2018, the company believes this segment’s underlying sales to grow by 4-6%, on the back of a favorable outlook for global demand within its served markets.

297,EMR,"On Feb 13, we issued an updated research report on industrial goods manufacturer, Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report).Regal Beloit reported solid fourth-quarter 2017 results on the back of modest organic growth and positive order trends. On a GAAP basis, the company reported net income of $51.5 million or $1.15 per share compared with $45.6 million or $1.01 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The significant year-over-year improvement was backed by higher revenues.Adjusted earnings were $1.14 per share compared with $1.04 in the year-ago quarter and came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales increased to $820.7 million from $758.1 million, largely driven by organic growth across all segments. Moreover, quarterly revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $790 million.Over the years, Regal Beloit has consolidated its product lines and streamlined brands to evolve as a dynamic enterprise. In order to drive continuous improvement, the company has strictly followed ‘Compass Operating System’ that encompasses a common set of business processes, disciplines and lean Six Sigma tools. Backed by an “open-door” management style, this has helped Regal Beloit gain a competitive advantage and reach more people in diverse markets around the world.In addition, the company has continually focused on prudent investment decisions for a disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet position and cash flow enhancement to support dividend growth. We believe that such moves, along with a robust operating platform and an efficient management team will help in the execution of its strategic priorities and drive net asset value in the future. The company’s strong free cash generation is another positive, providing it an opportunity to pursue accretive acquisitions and unlock additional value.Furthermore, Regal Beloit continues to focus on simplification initiatives to lower operating costs and improve margins in the future. The company expects organic growth in 2018 to be in low single digits with modest demand trends. Its long-term strategy involves organic growth through innovative products, broadening customer base, exploitation of new opportunities and tactical investments in emerging markets. The company has also expanded technologically and geographically on the back of its aggressive acquisition policy. Management further indicated that it plans to continue seeking accretive acquisitions as part of its overall growth strategy. Regal Beloit remains confident of generating robust operating cash flow to fund its organic and inorganic growth as well as return significant capital to its shareholders.Despite core strengths, Regal Beloit has underperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of of 0.7% compared with a 4.6% gain for the latter. The electric motor manufacturing space is a highly competitive and fragmented. With the rise in competition within the industry, the company is witnessing a decline in its product prices, which is detrimental to its overall margins. Also, it has to continually invest heavily in R&D to introduce newer value-added products that provide a hedge against competition.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Other stocks in the industry worth considering include ESCO Technologies Inc. (ESE  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) and A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.ESCO Technologies has topped estimates twice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.4%.Emerson Electric has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.3%.

298,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 68 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure was flat year over year.Favorable global market conditions and strong top-line growth boosted the bottom line, which was offset by high cost of sales and administrative expenses.Inside the HeadlinesThe fiscal third quarter saw the company return to growth, as both the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions platforms delivered net and underlying sales growth and boasted high-single digit order rates in the quarter. Net sales grew 9.9% year over year to $4,039 million. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,975 million. Underlying sales growth for the quarter was 4% and acquisitions contributed 7% to growth, while currency translation affected the top line adversely by 1%. Consistent improvement in key end markets and growth in the U.S., and Asia drove sales.The company’s Automation Solutions platform reported an impressive 12% year-over-year growth in net sales to $2,440 million. Underlying sales also grew 2%, as favorable trends in key served markets supported operations. Robust, broad-based demand in power, life sciences and chemical markets was driven by higher optimization projects and MRO activity. Underlying sales in North America rose 6%, led by energy-related markets, while Asia was also up 6%. Europe was down 5%, while Latin America and Middle East/Africa were also down 17% and 2% respectively.Margins contracted 70 basis points to 15.5%. However, excluding the dilutive impact of the Valves & Controls acquisition, margins actually expanded 170 basis points to 17.9%.MRO activity levels in energy-related markets are gathering momentum, particularly in North America, driven by shale and downstream customers. Power and life sciences markets also remained favorable. Continued improvement in order trends and an expanding project line indicate favorable momentum for the segment in the fiscal fourth quarter.The Commercial & Residential Solutions platform witnessed a 7% increase in net and underlying sales, with net sales coming in at $1,602 million, supported by robust demand in global HVAC and refrigeration markets, and encouraging conditions in construction related markets. Asia witnessed particularly strong growth once again, as it rose 17% year over year, driven by robust growth in China, which is enjoying major demand acceleration in refrigeration, heating and air conditioning markets. Europe was up 1%, while North America grew 6%, led by consistent strength in the air conditioning & refrigeration markets, and strong demand for professional tools in the oil and gas, and construction-related markets.Latin America went up 7%, while Middle East/Africa was down 6%.Under the platform, the Climate Technologies business grew 7.8% year over year to $1,187 million, while Tools & Home Products unit grew 3.8% year over year at $415 million.Margins contracted 50 basis points to 25.1%.Emerson Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteOther DevelopmentsDuring the fiscal second quarter, the company had completed the acquisition of Pentair Valves & Controls, a business unit of Pentair plc, for $3.15 billion.Integrating Pentair’s Valves & Controls business will enable Emerson to fortify its automation portfolio, and help it in offering complete valve solutions portfolio and sturdy service network, thereby elevating the company’s brand value.The company is now aggressively working on integrating the Valves & Controls business.  It expects the acquisition to be earnings accretive in fiscal 2018 and contribute meaningfully to operating cash flow.Emerson also expanded its global capabilities in fresh food monitoring, on the back of the Locus Traxx and PakSense buyouts. These two companies will assist Emerson in facilitating steady and safe control of food, and other temperature-sensitive goods.As part of its restructuring, Emerson had announced agreements to sell its Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses in fiscal 2016. The deals are part of the company’s portfolio-repositioning strategy, as it seeks to enhance focus on its core Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses. The restructuring will help Emerson leverage on its growth platforms and drive profitable growth.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.14 billion, with long-term debt of $3.8 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter rose 23% from the prior-year quarter to $774 million.OutlookIn light of the recent optimistic order trends and recovering end markets, Emerson raised its outlook for fiscal 2017 for the third consecutive time. It now expects net sales for the year to grow about 5%,with underlying sales to be up about 1%. This is comparable to the prior projections of net sales to be approximately flat,with underlying sales to be up about 1% (excluding unfavorable currency translation of approximately 1%).Further, in light of strong operational performance and positive order trends, Emerson now projects earnings per share for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $2.58–$2.62 (earlier guidance: $2.50–$2.60).Emerson now expects Automation Solutions net sales to be up 4–5% (earlier projection: down 3–4%), while Commercial & Residential Solutions net sales are anticipated to be up 5–6% (in line with earlier projections).To ConcludeIn the fiscal third quarter, the company returned to broad-based growth, driven by favorable trends in energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets, as well as strong demand in HVAC and refrigeration markets. Favorable construction markets in North America, Asia and Europe also boosted revenues.Emerson expects increasingly favorable global market conditions and positive trends in capital spending, which will likely drive underlying sales growth across both platforms in the coming quarters. Solid order trends, successful multi-year restructuring initiatives, and momentum in both its platforms should prove accretive for the company’s sales. Emerson’s cost-cutting initiatives are also likely to boost the company’s profitability significantly, going forward.However, a strong U.S. dollar, volatile industrial spending, and uncertainties in emerging and mature economies remain concerns.Emerson currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report) and Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report). While Barnes Group sports a Zacks rank #1 (Strong Buy), Eaton and Regal Beloit both carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Barnes Group has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates each time for an average of 11.6%.Eaton also has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average beat of 3.3% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice.Regal Beloit generated two beats over the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 1.5%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

299,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Feb 6. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 83 cents per share, reflecting a beat of 3.8%.We expect Emerson to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Emerson has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Emerson is +1.39% as the Most Accurate estimate of 55 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Reasons Driving Better-than-Expected Results Emerson is well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth, as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. Going forward, Emerson believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest growth drivers. Further, its restructuring efforts, undertaken over the past few quarters, are likely to prove conductive to upcoming results.Currently, the company’s Automation Solutions segment has been experiencing favorable trends in power and life sciences along with improving MRO spending by oil and gas customers, which is expected to boost growth. For the Commercial & Residential business, the company’s focus on domains like human comfort, connected home, food quality, advancing energy efficiency at home and work, is likely to prove conductive for its operations. Going forward, we believe selected investment opportunities along with positive trends in certain business areas offer modest growth opportunities.The company’s accretive acquisitions are also anticipatedto be conducive to its top line, in the to-be reported quarter. The company’s acquisition of Blending & Transfer Systems business of FMC Technologies will fortify presence in advanced flow measurement and control technologies. The company also acquired Pentair Valves & Controls, Locus Traxx and PakSense which are likely to drive sales.Despite these positives, prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets is likely to affect both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, which in turn may hurt Emerson’s operations. This apart, currency fluctuations haveremained a headwind over the past few quarters, and mightimpact earnings and revenues in the upcoming release as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

300,EMR,"A few industrial products companies are gearing up to report quarterly numbers on Aug 1. The Q2 earnings season is in full swing, with about 286 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than-expected earnings (as on Jul 28).Earnings of these companies (accounting for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 11.3% on 6.1% higher revenues. Of these companies, 74.5% have surpassed earnings estimates, with 69.2% coming ahead of revenue estimates.As per our latest Earnings Preview, dated Jul 28, data projects that the total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are now on track to grow an impressive 9.2% from the year-ago period, on 5% higher revenues. This is comparable to earnings growth expectations of 5.6% recorded at the beginning of the reporting season.The Industrial Products space (which accounts for about 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization) is anticipated to chart one of the highest earnings growth rates this quarter amongst all Zacks sectors. In fact, its earnings are on track to be up 17.6% in the quarter, on 13.8% higher sales compared with the last year.Industrial products stocks have performed well in second-quarter 2017, with the industry gaining roughly 4.7%, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 2.7% (Apr 1 to Jun 30). We believe that growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Further, there are economic indicators which point toward a strong operating environment for the industry. Industrial production — which measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors — grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, led by robust growth in mining and utilities. Additionally, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery rose 4.6% in the first five months of 2017, largely for the construction, mining and oil and gas field machinery. These indicators bode well for the industry.Let’s have a look at how some industrial companies are positioned, ahead of their scheduled announcements tomorrow:Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) is engaged principally in the worldwide design, manufacture, and sale of a broad range of electrical, electromechanical and electronic products and systems. The company has a modest earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates twice in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 4.3%. In the last reported quarter, the company reported in-line earnings.Our quantitative model hints at an earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in Q2. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of +2.94% (the Most Accurate estimate of 70 cents being higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents), in addition to the favorable Zacks Rank.(For more details, read: Emerson to Report Q3 Earnings: Is a Beat in Store?).For a possible earnings beat, the company should have the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.

The power management company has a decent earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 3.3%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 10.3%.A favorable rank and positive Earnings ESP hint toward an earnings beat this season for the company.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company’s Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a favorable Zacks Rank #3 indicate that Eaton Corporation’s earnings will likely beat estimates this quarter. Its Most Accurate estimate of $1.18 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16.

In the last reported quarter, the company missed estimates by 5.1%.We do not expect Xylem to beat expectations this quarter. Though the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

301,EMR,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Emerson is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for EMR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 70 cents per share for EMR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for EMR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.94% heading into earnings season.Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that EMR has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

303,EMR,"Protection safety equipment & services provider Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1, after the market closes.In the last four quarters, the company delivered better-than-expected results, pulling off an average positive earnings surprise of 6.27%. In the last quarter, earnings of 83 cents per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.22%.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In the last three months, the company’s shares have yielded 10.4% return, outperforming roughly 1.5% gain of the industry it belongs to.Let us see how things are shaping up for Fortune Brands this quarter.Factors to Affect Q4 ResultsFortune Brands will gain from the strengthening U.S. housing market in the quarter. Housing starts exhibited solid month-over-month gains in October and November but slipped 8.2% in December. Overall, housing starts in the fourth quarter were up roughly 6.7% from the previous quarter. Favorable population and robust labor market are likely to lead to new constructions while aging existing construction will raise demand for repair and remodelling services.In the fourth quarter, Fortune Brands anticipates Cabinets segment’s sales to grow in the mid-single digit range. This segment deals with manufacturing and selling of custom, semi-custom and stock cabinetry and vanities.The company’s Cabinets segment failed to meet the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the first three quarters of 2017 while surpassing it in one. The segment’s sales in the fourth quarter are estimated to be $634 million, above $614 million generated in the last quarter. As reported by Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association, cabinetry sales in January-November 2017 grew 2.8% year over year, with stock cabinet sales and semi-custom sales increasing 3% and 3.5%, respectively. However, custom cabinet sales slipped 0.4%.Also, Fortune Brands anticipates sales in the Doors segment to increase in mid-single digits in 2017 while Security segment’s sales are predicted to increase in mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. The plumbing segment will benefit from new brand additions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Doors segment’s revenues stand at $130 million for the fourth quarter, below $138 million reported in the third quarter. The consensus estimate for the Security segment is $162, above $158 million recorded in the previous quarter, and for the Plumbing segment is $457 million, above $438 million in the third quarter.In addition, we believe that development of new products, addition of well-known brands through acquisitions and favorable impact of foreign currencies might be possible tailwinds in the quarter. On the flip side, headwinds like sudden inflation in raw materials price or supply shortage, industry competition and burden of high debt levels might affect results.Stocks to ConsiderOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

304,EMR,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) recently acquired ProSys, a global supplier of software and services that facilitates increased production and safety for chemical, pulp & paper, oil & gas, as well as refining industries. ProSys’ unique technologies and proficiency will enable Emerson to aid customers in improving plant performance, safety and profitability by optimizing human as well as automation resources.Acquisition RationaleThe acquisition complements Emerson’s buyout of MYNAH Technologies in May 2017. ProSys’ portfolio consists of solutions that aid management of alarms crucial to plant production, as well as handling changing plant states.ProSys’ software portfolio supports Emerson’s Operational Certainty program, which allows industrial companies to realize Top Quartile performance in areas such as safety, reliability as well as production. ProSys’ technologies, when combined with Emerson’s added expertise will enable operators to navigate plant systems safely and efficiently. This will also allow customers to accommodate the changing state and age of the industrial workforce.Our TakeEmerson has been executing restructuring activities since 2015 to drive efficiency and growth. The company has taken a series of concerted efforts to develop a better brand with significant customer focus. It has also devised cost cutting and divestment plans to unlock greater benefits in the coming quarters. All of its segments garnered significant savings from restructuring actions. Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 22.1% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 11.6%.The company’s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to be conducive to core business. The company is on a constant lookout for small bolt-on and strategic acquisitions to restore sales, up to $20 billion and cash flow back to over $3.2 billion, over a span of next five years. Recently, the company completed the buyout of Pentair Valves & Controls and a business unit of Pentair plc. Further, the company expanded global capabilities in fresh food monitoring, with the acquisitions of Locus Traxx and PakSense. We believe such strategic buyouts will supplement the top-line performance, going forward. This apart, the company’s diligent efforts for launching new products and technologies helps it to gain a competitive advantage over peers.However, the fact remains that, prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, which in turn are hurting Emerson’s operations. Moreover, the company’s operations have been suffering as a result of slow spending in general industrial markets. This has affected its order rates across the related segments, consequently pulling down the company’s top line.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Barnes Group, Inc. (B  -  Free Report) and Donaldson Company, Inc. (DCI  -  Free Report). While Deere & Company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Barnes Group and Donaldson Company carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
