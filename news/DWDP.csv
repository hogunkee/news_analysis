1,DWDP,"United Technologies (UTX) pushed back after an activist investor said a split of the underperforming industrial conglomerate would release billions in shareholder value.In a quarterly investor letter Friday, Third Point CEO Dan Loeb argued for breaking United Tech into three business units — elevators, climate control and aerospace. The hedge fund sees such a move reversing years of underperformance; realizing the full potential of the company's franchise assets; and fixing problems for the advanced Geared Turbofan jet engine from United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney unit.The letter spoke of a new ""significant stake"" in the $100 billion industrial giant, which had already been reported in March.United Technologies countered in a statement that it ""disagrees with several of the assertions"" in the Third Point letter, without specifying which. It added a full portfolio review should be completed this year, after the pending acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL) closes. CEO Greg Hayes has said he is mulling a breakup of core businesses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Third Point's letter made note of United Tech's ""weak operating performance"" and added ""a three-way split would unlock in excess of $20 billion of value,"" net of separation costs.Third Point added: ""UTC fits a pattern of many underperforming conglomerates where value is diminished by the ill effects of a 'one size fits all' approach to corporate strategy, incentive compensation, and capital allocation."" A history of poor management led most recently to the ""botched ramp-up"" of the next-generation geared turbofan (GTF) engine, it said.Some Wall Street analysts expected the GTF to be a profit driver. But problems with the jet engine led to grounded flights and tensions with aircraft maker Airbus (EADSY).Meanwhile, rival jet engine maker General Electric (GE) reports deliveries of its next-gen Leap are behind schedule. A GE unit made the Boeing (BA) jet engine that blew apart midair in April.Some analysts have argued that struggling General Electric should break up.

4,DWDP,"General Electric (GE) is exploring ""hybrid deals"" with public companies to combine assets that could include spinning off its transportation business, the Wall Street Journal reported.The so-called hybrid deals would give shareholders stakes in multiple public companies. They could be structured in a way that avoids a big tax bill from an outright sale, the report said.After examining several options for its struggling transportation business since the fall, GE may do an IPO after reportedly failing to find a buyer.An initial public offering or spinoff of the rail division appears near, the Journal said. It had reported earlier that the business is one of GE's oldest but is valued low, making a big tax bill likely if it is sold.Management doesn't have to look far afield or far back for inspiration as it considers hybrid deals. The 2017 deals that created Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE) and DowDuPont (DWDP) could serve as templates. The moves under consideration are part of CEO John Flannery's ongoing portfolio review as he looks to turn the embattled 126-year-old company around.But GE Capital could be up for sale although its ""liabilities and uncertainties might require GE to write a check to complete such a deal,"" the Journal said.

7,DWDP,"HOUSTON — Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Wednesday the conversation about the White House's proposed tariffs is ""ongoing"" and that he isn't sure President Trump has made up his mind ""with clarity"" on the matter.X The Trump administration's plan to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has had a chilly reception from the energy industry and related sectors, as executives gather at CERAWeek 2018.On Tuesday, Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) CEO Timothy Dove said the tariffs would have a ""negative impact"" on the shale exploration and production company's returns. On Monday, Plains All American Pipeline (PAA) CEO Greg Armstrong said the company has $1.5 billion in projects that use a lot of steel that could be impacted by the tariffs.And chemical giant DowDuPont (DWDP) told Bloomberg that it's considering a major investment in Canada or Argentina instead of the U.S. Gulf Coast because steel tariffs would make domestic construction more costly. Exxon Mobil (XOM), however, said Wednesday it plans to invest $20 billion in Gulf Coast refining projects.Perry, who touted the Trump administration's efforts to ease oil and gas regulations in his opening remarks, later told the press that he thinks the tariffs are an ongoing debate.""I'm not going to speak for the president today, but not sure he's made up his mind with clarity about where he wants to go with this,"" he said.Perry said Trump wants to send a signal to countries that use subsidies that hit U.S. manufacturing jobs, adding that he agrees with Trump that ""we need to be better negotiators, look for better deals for the United States.""DowDuPont shares slipped 1.5% on the stock market today and Exxon sank 3.2% amid a broad market sell-off.

So Cohn's abrupt departure suggests that the major averages would come under near-term pressure.S&P 500 futures fell 1% below fair value.

It also means Cohn won't be around to argue against further protectionist moves.Indeed, there were reports that the U.S. can levy a big trade case vs. China. In some ways, criticism of the steel and aluminum tariffs could spur the China action. Opponents of those proposed duties note that the U.S. imports very little steel from China.Trump did say Tuesday that Canada and Mexico might be tariff relief if there's a revised Nafta deal.

13,DWDP,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes.

14,DWDP,"A good economy had the odd effect of sinking the S&P 500 on Monday, amid concerns about higher prices and borrowing costs as central banks remove the crutches intended to support rebounds in the U.S. and abroad.X But for the individual companies in the S&P 500 index, quarterly results — that more granular measure of customer attitudes and one of the main drivers of any stock — are surpassing Wall Street forecasts at a particularly high rate, one not seen since the previous decade.The above-the-bar results have been helped, as ever, by tech, health care and financials, including Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) UnitedHealth (UNH) and Mastercard (MA). But companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and Eastman Chemical (EMN) have led suppliers of materials higher. Industrials — minus long-ailing General Electric (GE) — also look solid after a long drought.Among the 322 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, 78% topped Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data released Thursday. Eighty percent beat estimates for revenue.That's the best rate of above-estimate earnings since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thompson Reuters. For sales, it's the best since at least 2002.S&P 500 earnings are currently on track to deliver a 14.7% gain, with revenue up a robust 8%. That assumes that the remaining S&P 500 companies due to report will meet estimates.Analysts also appear optimistic about first-quarter earnings, even as the prospect of higher wages touches off investor fears of inflation, and economic growth stirs anxieties that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates to keep that growth honest.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, the global recovery has brought new demand for technology, energy and infrastructure. And a rebound in oil prices has boosted demand for equipment of all kinds, lifting industrials and, in turn, demand for the suppliers of chemical materials.In the stock market today, the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite sold off yet again as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs. Stocks rallied strongly to start 2018 in part on expectations for strong, broad earnings growth.Within Thomson Reuters' Materials sector, which includes companies like DowDuPont and Eastman, 94% of companies have beat on earnings for the most recent quarter — the highest percentage of all 11 industry sectors measured by the firm. Eighty-one percent of companies in the Materials segment have beat on revenue.Even as the troubles deepen at General Electric, which has weighed on growth in the industrial sector as it tries to focus more on aviation, power and health care — that segment overall has remained solid. Seventy-four percent have beat on earnings, 81% on revenue.GE earnings per share slid 41% in the fourth quarter. It faces an SEC investigation, and one analyst said the company could be removed from the Dow.Within the technology sector, 85% of technology companies have beaten earnings estimates, led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), CA (CA), Intel (INTC) and Xilinx (XLNX). Ninety percent beat on revenue, amid strong growth in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.More tech companies are also bringing in bigger businesses as consumers.""You're seeing a transition from consumer-based to business-based, which is a big driver,"" Aurelio said. ""So you're seeing things like data-center growth.""In the Consumer-Discretionary category, where around three quarters of companies have produced above-the-bar results, Amazon (AMZN) last week turned out earnings far ahead of analyst expectations, helped by the GOP's new tax law and the broader migration to e-commerce and smart devices.""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at that time. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""Earnings from 89% of companies in Thomson Reuters' Health Care segment — which includes biotech, pharmaceuticals and health care services — came in above analyst views; 91% beat on revenue.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, was among them. But the companies that surpassed earnings estimates by the widest margin were pharma distributor Cardinal Health (CAH), ResMed (RMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign dental braces.Those earnings follow a 2017 that BMO analyst Matt Borsch (who follows managed care companies, hospitals and other care providers) characterized as mediocre, in terms of volume — or the number of inpatient admissions, outpatient procedures, and doctor and emergency-room visits.But more of that volume, he said, has been packed into the end of the fourth quarter, as more people meet their deductible on their high-deductible plans, which have become increasingly common.""When you have the high-deductible health plans, you generally have a pretty strong dynamic of people, on average, increasing their utilization significantly after they've met the deductible, and therefore that is why you see that more late in the year,"" he said.The companies who have reported so far, largely, aren't benefiting from low expectations, either. Expectations have remained relatively similar for earnings this quarter compared with quarters past and were a tad higher for revenue, Aurelio said.As investors make their way through fourth-quarter results and the market's volatility, the outlook for the first quarter remains not so bad.""Typically as you get closer to the next earnings season, the expectations decrease,"" Aurelio said. ""So we'd see the growth rate for Q1 normally drop, and it's been going up.""At the beginning of the year, he said, expectations were for 12.2% earnings growth in the first quarter. On Thursday, growth expectations were for 17.8%. That's despite lowered guidance from Apple (AAPL) and many iPhone chip suppliers.""So that's a pretty bullish signal,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?Big Wage Gain Sinks Stocks, Bonds: 3 Reasons To Doubt The DataDid Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Will Brokerages Receive Fresh Lift From Tax Reform, Rate Hikes?ObamaCare Exchange Enrollment Shows Surprise Gain, Despite Trump's Attacks

15,DWDP,"Key market indexes were down hard Tuesday as Alphabet (GOOGL) weighed on techs and the 10-year Treasury yield hit 3% for the first time since 2014, raising expectations for four Fed rate hikes this year.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) slumped 2%, PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) also tumbled 2% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) sank 1.4% in the stock market today. Foreign markets held up better as iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) and iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) gave up 0.3% each.3M (MMM), which reported quarterly earnings in line with views, weighed on the Dow with an 8.5% drop. Caterpillar (CAT) reversed to a 6% loss, while Boeing (BA), Travelers (TRV) and DowDuPont (DWDP) each fell 4% or more.Apple (AAPL) shed 1.4% as it slid further below its 200-day moving average and extended its losing streak to five. Shares have fallen amid reports of weaker iPhone demand. Related chip stocks took another hit Tuesday as analysts cut their ratings and/or price targets on iPhone chip suppliers. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) fell 0.9%.Among other techs, Alphabet lost 4.5% to test its 200-day moving average. The Google parent late Monday reported Q1 results that beat views on both the top and bottom lines, but its traffic acquisition costs were higher than expected. The rest of the FANG stocks also fell: Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) were down about 4% apiece.The biggest sector fund decliners included industrials, biotech and technology ETFs. Gold miners, utilities and real estate led the upside among sector plays. Gold futures climbed 0.5% to $1,330.40 an ounce.Bitcoin gained 5% to $9,408.25, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) popped 9% as it pads gains above its 50-day line and extends its win streak to five.New sector leaders are emerging in the exchange traded fund universe as oil prices surge to three-year highs amid continued unrest in the Mideast.Energy is ranked No. 10 among the 33 sectors tracked by IBD. Dig a bit deeper into the sector and you'll find most oil & gas industry groups have moved up the ranks from three weeks ago: U.S. exploration & production to No. 16, up from No. 59, oilfield services to No. 21 from No. 94, oil machinery to No. 24 vs. No. 79.Other risers in the top 50 industry groups include: Refining to No. 33 vs. No. 93, drilling to No. 35 vs. No. 110, and international exploration & production, No. 38 vs. No. 139.So it shouldn't be too surprising to see several oil-and-gas ETFs building bases or getting close to potential buy points. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) continues to work on the right side of a three-month cup base with a 40.29 entry.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Top holdings as of April 20 included QEP Resources (QEP), Whiting Petroleum (WLL), Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO) and HollyFrontier (HFC).XOP's 4.7% year-to-date gain through Friday, according to Morningstar Direct, outpaces the S&P 500's 0.4% return. But the ETF sharply lags the S&P 500 based on its average annual performance over the longer haul, with losses over the past three, five and 10 years vs. the broader index's 10.6%, 13.8% and 9.1% gains for those respective periods. It carries a 0.35% expense ratio.Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer of investment manager DoubleLine Capital, recommended going long in XOP and shorting Facebook (FB) at a conference in New York.

16,DWDP,"Tech stocks led Tuesday's market rally, which was fueled by easing trade war fears following China President Xi Jinping's pro-globalization remarks.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) leapt 2.2%, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) rallied 1.8%,and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) advanced 1.6% in the stock market today. DowDuPont (DWDP), Intel (INTC) and Boeing (BA) were among seven Dow stocks rising more than 3% each.Apple (AAPL) added 2.1% to regain its 50-day moving average, which it gave up Monday. Shares of the iPhone maker have been hitting resistance at that line the past three weeks. They have held above the 200-day line during that time.Facebook (FB) gained 4.2% as CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before a Senate Committee regarding the data scandal. Shares remain below their 200-day line and are 15% off their high.Energy, semiconductors and biotechs were among the biggest sector fund gainers Tuesday, while utilities and real estate lagged. VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) surged nearly 6% to retake its 50-day line for the first time in over two months. West Texas intermediate crude prices soared 4% to $65.79 a barrel.SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) gained 4.5% and Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) added 3.6%.Graphics chip designer and artificial intelligence player Nvidia (NVDA) vaulted nearly 6% on an upgrade from Morgan Stanley to overweight from equal weight. It's now 4% below its 50-day moving average and 10% off its 52-week high.Given the market's volatility, most U.S. stock funds are testing support near their 200-day moving average.So it stands to reason that a commodity-based safe-haven play is faring better. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which tracks the price of gold, remains above its 50-day moving average. Shares may be forming a flat base with a potential buy point at 129.61. GLD was last featured in this ETF column on March 29 as it sought support at the 50-day line.The $36.8 billion fund extended its year-to-date gain to 2.6% as of Monday, according to Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500, meantime, pulled back 2.3%. But the gold ETF's average annual returns over the past three, five and 10 years sharply lag the S&P 500's performance over those same periods.GLD carries a 0.40% expense ratio. Younger peer iShares Gold Trust (IAU), which bears a 0.25% expense ratio, shows similar price action to GLD.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Other news shaking up the market include Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), he notes, which could face close regulatory scrutiny.""Although U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, and China's proposed taxes on American goods, have not been imposed yet, markets are already beginning to price in the news,"" Holmes wrote. ""A trade war could be a concern sometime down the road, but I'm confident U.S. and Chinese officials can work together to avert a full-blown tit-for-tat standoff.""However, due to some early warnings sings of possible economic turbulence ahead, Holmes says: ""I would highly urge investors to ensure a portion of their portfolio is in a historically reliable store of value—investment-grade municipal bonds, for instance, and gold bullion and gold mining stocks.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Pare Gains As Apple Tests Support Again And Bitcoin DropsWill The Escalating U.S.-China Trade War Hurt Your Stock Funds?Could Blockchain Be A Bigger Disrupter Than The Internet?

17,DWDP,"Blue chips led the pack midday Thursday, as the Nasdaq gave back part of its early gains. Volume was up on both major exchanges.X The Nasdaq gripped a 0.2% gain after being up 0.5% early in the session. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.5% at midday. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, while the small cap Russell 2000 was flat.Two stocks in the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average showed especially good action. DowDuPont (DWDP) broke out of a 10-week flat base. The stock rose 1.63 to 74.68, crossing above a 73.95 buy point. Volume was about 10% above average.DowDuPont will report Q4 results before the market's open Feb. 1. The Street expects earnings to fall 33% to 66 cents a share. For the full year 2017, analysts estimate earnings will edge up 1%. In 2018, earnings are expected to surge 25%.Another Dow stock, IBM (IBM), popped 3.48 to 161.97 in heavy volume.The stock cleared a 157.95 buy point Wednesday in twice its usual volume. IBM will report Q4 results Jan. 18. Revenue has been a concern among analysts. The Street expects revenue to grow 1.3% to $22.05 billion in Q4.IBM's 157.95 buy point is flawed. The cup-with-handle base lacks a prior 30% uptrend. This makes the breakout less likely to work. However, the torrid volume Wednesday and so far Thursday are signs of institutional buying.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) trimmed its position 20%, 16% and  31% in Q1, Q2 and Q3 respectively. IBM is Berkshire's eighth largest position, but analysts will be looking at the Q4 data to see if Buffett trims the position further.The Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY) rose modestly Thursday but is up 3.4% so far this week.

18,DWDP,"U.S. stock indexes sauntered to small gains midday Friday, with only small caps holding a losing hand for the week. Volume was running higher on the NYSE but flat on the Nasdaq.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average sagged 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which was on track for a loss for the week, rose 0.8%.Breakouts midday Friday in strong volume included Signature Bank (SBNY), up 3% in volume 78% above average, and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA), up 3% in volume 330% greater than usual. Lions Gate has been rallying on word that the company is in buyout talks.Investors also might want to monitor stocks that are either in buy zones or close to buy points. For example, despite rising 25% last year and 5% year to date, the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average still has some potential buy opportunities.Stocks in their 5% buy zones include Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM), Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and DowDuPont (DWDP).Dow stocks in bases and not far from potential buy points include Coca-Cola (KO) and Travelers Companies (TRV).Of the above seven Dow stocks, four are expected to accelerate earnings growth in 2018. The four are Apple, Travelers, DowDuPont and Coca-Cola. Each has a base that is either first or second stage.As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from later stages.The base count is one reason why Apple may have more left as an investment. Also, Apple grew earnings 11% in fiscal 2017 ended in September, and the Street expects growth to pick up to 24% in fiscal 2018. While the 24% growth may be priced into the stock, earnings surprises offer the potential for additional thrust.Meanwhile, among IBD's 197 industry groups, three groups have shown uncommon strength this week.Over the past five sessions, the chip equipment group jumped 7% (think of stocks such as Applied Materials (AMAT)), while the commercial document group popped 4% (think label company Multi-Color (LABL)) and the hotel segment rose 3% (think La Quinta (LQ)). The biggest loser for the week was office supplies, down 5%.RELATED:Schlumberger Is Bullish Oil-Patch SpendingRetirement: Changes In The Roth IRACan This Great Stock Lead Again?

IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) gave up 1.6%. Gold plays also lagged. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) lost 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively, as gold futures slid 0.8% to $1,329.60 an ounce. Both ETFs gapped down below their 50-day lines.Most U.S. equity stocks and funds have come under pressure amid recent market volatility, but a Vietnam ETF is near highs after a breakout.VanEck Vectors Vietnam (VNM) climbed past a 19.36 cup-with-handle buy point March 20. It  pulled back and broke out again a week later. It remains near the top of a buy range from the entry. But keep in mind: All purchases are at much greater than usual risk with the market in correction.The $450.6 million fund was last featured in the ETF Leaders column on March 15, as shares approached the potential buy point. The fund formed much of the base along support at its 50-day moving average.VNM tracks the MVIS Vietnam Index, which is composed of companies based in Vietnam or that generate at least 50% of their revenue in Vietnam.

SPY fell to its 200-day moving average.On the Dow, Nike and Boeing held slim gains after rising 3% each intraday. They were the only two advancers. Athletic shoe giant Nike reported quarterly results late Thursday that topped views and offered a bullish outlook. But DowDuPont (DWDP), 3M (MMM) and Pfizer (PFE) lost more than 3% apiece.Big-cap techs showed continued weakness: Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) each fell 2% or more.

VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) tumbled 3% to take out its 50-day moving average. Dow component Intel fell 2.7%, while graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) slid nearly 4% and rolled back below its 50-day line for the second time this week. Micron Technology (MU), which reported earnings late Thursday, was down nearly 8%.Investors flocked to a safe haven Thursday as technology and most other sectors got routed amid heightened trade war fears.Most equity ETFs saw losses. But Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) held on for a 0.4% gain and even managed to close above its 50-day moving average. The defensive ETF has been testing that support line the past week. When the market is in confirmed uptrend, a rebound off the 50-day can set up a potential buy opportunity. But when the uptrend is under pressure, all buys are at greater risk than usual.Also note that since late January, the 50-day line has been below the 200-day line. That's a bearish sign. However, the big tech sell-off begs the question: Is sector rotation occurring?

22,DWDP,"Bayer (BAYRY) faces continued U.S. antitrust objections over its planned takeover of Monsanto (MON), as officials fears the merger would hurt competition, according to two people familiar with the matter.The Justice Department's antitrust division doesn't think Bayer's proposal to sell businesses goes far enough, said the people. The government wants the German chemicals company to divest more assets to resolve its concerns, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the investigation is confidential.Negotiations between the two sides are continuing and a final decision by the government is probably months away, the person said. Talks have been constructive as Bayer has taken steps to address the government's concerns, the person added.Monsanto shares tumbled 4% to 118.18 on the stock market today, after briefly hitting 116.29.

28,DWDP,"Stocks continued to shine on the third day of trading in 2018, and this time the Nasdaq lagged.X Following gains of 1.5% and 0.8% on Tuesday and Wednesday, the tech-rich Nasdaq composite rallied 0.2% by day's end, backing off intraday highs in a rather tight trading session. Yet the leading index of 2017 (up more than 28% that year) still looks poised to hold firmly above the 7000 level in its first week of trading in 2018.Defensive stocks continued to struggle. The Dow utility average, losing more than 1% on both Tuesday and Wednesday, fell another 0.8% on Thursday. The Dow transports added 0.3% and stands as a current leader among sector indexes since Jan. 1, up more than 2%.Meanwhile, DowDuPont (DWDP) is giving large-cap investors a chance to time their new buy wisely as the chemicals giant broke out Thursday, rising out of a nearly 10-week flat base that shows a 73.95 buy point. Shares rose 2.1% to 74.60, helping the Dow Jones industrials rise 0.6%. The S&P 500 is up 0.4%.For a flat base, simply add 10 cents to the base's left-side high, or in DowDuPont's case, 73.85. DowDuPont corrected less than 8% within the base from intraday high to low, falling nicely within the maximum 15% decline threshold.Volume in DowDuPont, a fundamentals turnaround play not too unlike Apple's (AAPL) situation in 2016-2017, is running mildly above average. For a big or megacap stock, you'd prefer to see volume run 40% above the 50-day average or higher. However, in some cases, huge turnover doesn't come in until days or even weeks after the breakout itself.Also notice on a daily chart how turnover has definitely heated up compared with the dull volume days during the last two weeks of December.Analysts see DowDuPont's earnings up just 1% in 2017 to $3.22 a share, but then surge 25% to $4.03 a share, which would be the highest earnings since at least 2008. Total sales rose 36% in 2016 to $66.18 billion, and are seen gaining 18% in 2017 to $78.07 billion and up 7% to $83.48 billion this year.DowDuPont has grown sales in each of the past seven quarters. The increases range from 8% to 46%.The Dow Jones industrial average component has 2.34 billion shares outstanding and a market value of $174 billion.The Street sees earnings slipping 33% to 66 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2017, despite revenue rising 49% to $19.43 billion. There may be some restructuring expenses hitting the bottom line following a historic merger between Dow Chemical and DuPont. The company has been cutting jobs and closing facilities as part of a $3 billion savings plan.However, DowDuPont's earnings are expected to bounce back the next quarter, rising 20% to $1.21 a share in the first quarter of 2018 on an 8% hike in sales to $22.17 billion.Elsewhere the highflying Bitcoin-tracking Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is cooling its heels after stupendous gains in December. The ETF fell just 2.2% to 2,204 in ultralight trade. Average volume has recently expanded to 133,000 shares, so the dollar volume is ample for most traders.At this point, following a hyperbolic run last month and a elevatorlike plunge over just four sessions, quiet trading is a welcome change. But at the current price level, the risk of losing money on a new buy is likely higher than normal. Why? Bitcoin Investment has not corrected long enough to produce a genuine new chart pattern that can maximize short-term gain and minimize losses.Over the next several weeks, keep tracking the price movement. Does it hold above its fast-rising 50-day moving average? Will it form a bullish new base such as a cup or double bottom? Or do big sellers come in strong again? Only time will tell.Some commentators believe the strength of Bitcoin is bullish for gold. Gold-related ETFs are doing well so far this year.The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) investment trust rose more than 0.5% to 125.46 in turnover boosting 10% above usual levels. A new base has been forming since the large-cap ETF topped at 128.32 in September. SPDR Gold is now less than 3% below that peak.The current base has elements of a double bottom, which would give a 124.07 entry, 10 cents above the Oct. 16 middle peak of 123.97.Airlines have been rising in recent months, but strength in crude oil futures lately may serve as a stiff headwind. American Airlines (AAL) tried to break out of an 11-week cup with handle that features a 53.57 buy point. But shares, after hitting as high as 54.40 intraday, shaved its gain to less than 0.7% at 52.68. Plus, volume is limp.Southwest Air (LUV), part of IBD Leaderboard, is down slightly. At 64.70, it's extended from a proper buy point, after having broken out past 59.99 in a large cup with handle.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Southwest has one of the best Composite Ratings among the U.S. companies within IBD's Transport-Airline industry group at 81 on a scale of 1 to 99.The Dow transportation average rallied 0.4%. At 10,863, the sector index is up nearly 2.4% since Jan. 1.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and stock market analysis.)RELATED:Can You Really Identify Major Stock Market Peaks?

Exxon's is 16%. Estimates for DowDuPont and Exxon represent upward revisions.

30,DWDP,"DowDuPont (DWDP), formed by the combination of the largest U.S. chemical makers, reported preliminary third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates as prices climbed and demand rose in most of its markets.XEarnings excluding some items rose to 55 cents a share from 50 cents a year earlier, when calculated as if the companies were always merged, DowDuPont said in a statement Thursday. The company was expected to earn 41 cents a share, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Pro-forma sales climbed 7.6% to $18.3 billion, beating the $17.5 billion average estimate.The Aug. 31 merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont created the world's largest chemical maker until the company executes its plan to split into three. Third-quarter results were driven by ""robust consumer-led demand"" and higher prices, the company said. The gains more than made up for higher costs, weak agricultural conditions in Brazil and the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Hurricanes reduced earnings in the quarter by about $250 million, the company said last month.""Given that DowDuPont already recalibrated expectations for the hurricane impacts and headwinds in Brazil, the upside surprise is, in our view, more positive than it looks, and bodes well for Q4,"" Laurence Alexander, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. who recommends buying the shares, said in a note to investors.Shares of the Dow industrials component rose 2.8% to 73.05 on the stock market today, hitting a new record high.The company last month announced changes to its split-up plan that will increase the material science unit's focus on commodity products such as polyethylene plastic. The agriculture unit was unchanged, while the specialty products business will gain silicones, auto adhesives and pharmaceutical ingredients.On a net basis, the company earned 32 cents a share on revenue of $15.4 billion. Adjusted earnings exclude costs for integration and separation, restructuring, certain taxes and amortization of changes in the value of DuPont's inventories, as well as a gain from the sale of a co-polymers business.Final results for the quarter are due to be announced Nov. 2.RELATED:Caterpillar Soars On Blowout Q3 Earnings, Raised Guidance3M Raises Outlook After Strong Q3 Earnings; Dow Stock Gaps To HighUnited Technologies Tops Q3 Earnings Views, Raises GuidanceDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

Some of the heaviest losses came from gold miners, solar energy stocks and utilities.The Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.3%, as more than a third of its stocks turned in gained of more than 3%. DowDuPont (DWDP) and Home Depot (HD) led the index, but Apple (AAPL) was the mover and shaker, reversing a brief early decline and ending up 4.2%. The huge-volume move showed solid support at the stock's 40-week moving average.Exxon-Mobil (XOM) posted the Dow's biggest loss of the day, down 1.6%. That left the oil giant 8% lower for the week and nearly 13% below its Jan. 29 high.The S&P 500 advanced 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite bounced 2.1% higher, aided by Apple and by FANG stock tech leaders Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), which rose 3.8% and 4.5%, respectively. Amazon's move left shares less than 4% from Friday's high, and still extended after a breakout in January. Netflix ended 8% below its high, but also extended from a January breakout.Chip stocks posted many of the Nasdaq's strongest moves of the session. Micron Technology (MU) jetted 11% higher as a pair of analyst upgrades followed an increase to its fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings guidance, and news of a new chief financial officer, announced after Monday's close. The gain hoisted shares back to their 10-week moving average, as the stock continues building a two-month base pattern.In earnings news, the day's biggest winners were all tech names: Fabrinet (FN), Oclaro (OCLR) and Lumentum Holdings (LITE).

33,DWDP,"General Electric (GE) may be removed from the Dow Jones industrial average, to which it has belonged for more than 110 years, according to a Wall Street analyst.X GE is one of the original members of the Dow, a price-weighted measure of 30 U.S. blue-chip companies invented by Charles Dow in 1896. The index covers all industries except transportation and utilities.""We believe the chances that GE could be removed from the Dow are increasing as GE continues to face substantial challenges including earnings and cash pressure, tough global power generation markets, aggressive downsizing, shrinking its portfolio, management shake-up and SEC investigations,"" Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch wrote Wednesday.GE's falling share price makes it an ""outlier"" and ""likely candidate for removal"" from an index that aims to reflect the ""best"" large U.S. companies, Inch said.He sees headline risk if GE were to be dropped from the Dow, noting that roughly 40% of GE's common stock is held by retail investors.Shares of GE closed up 1.4% at 16.17 on the stock market today, after ending the previous session below 16 for the first time since Dec. 1, 2011.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.GE doesn't have to be replaced by another industrial giant, and recent changes show new components don't always come from the same sectors of dropped components.In the latest tweak, DowDuPont (DWDP) replaced DuPont in Sept. 1, 2017, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, after it merged with Dow Chemical.Before that, Apple (AAPL) replaced AT&T (T) on March 19, 2015. And on Sept. 23, 2013, Goldman Sachs (GS) replaced Bank of America (BAC), Visa (V) replaced Hewlett-Packard, which split up, and Nike (NKE) replaced Alcoa, which also split up.A committee made up of three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two from the Wall Street Journal meets twice a year to consider if any changes are needed to the Dow index.Committee members prefer the ratio between the highest share price and lowest share price among components to be no more than 10:1. But the current ratio between Boeing (BA) (the highest) and GE (the lowest) exceeds 20:1, Deutsche Bank said.A spokeswoman for S&P Dow Jones Indices declined to comment. ""As a matter of firm policy, we do not provide comment on additions or drops to our indices as we consider this information to be market moving and material,"" she said.One way for GE to stay in the Dow could be a reverse stock split.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How To Choose The Best Online Stock Brokers: Start HereBest Stocks To Buy And WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market Using A Simple Routine

36,DWDP,"The Nasdaq composite led another broad-based rally Friday on the back of decent buying in the semiconductor, retail internet, internet content and other technology sectors to cap a rosy start to 2018.X The tech-rich index, up nearly 0.7% at around 3 p.m. ET, also got an assist from fast growing firms in the game software space, such as Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI). The former, up 5% to 112.46, reclaimed both its 50- and 200-day moving averages in swift trading, a positive sign. Watch for a potential new base to finish.Meanwhile, Activision, a nice winner in 2017, is also showing nice support at the 50- and 200-day moving averages lately, but there's clear upside price resistance near the 66-67 level.Stiff gains in heavier than usual volume are a bullish trend, for it hints at a strong appetite for equities by the institutional crowd, i.e. mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors, banks, insurers and pension managers.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were not far behind, up around 0.5% to 0.6%. The Nasdaq is poised to finish the week up more than 3%. Six of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rallied 1 point or more.Another Dow 30 component, DowDuPont (DWDP), is having a terrific week, rising for a fourth straight session and moving further past a 73.95 entry in a sound flat base. Shares are up 1% to 75.28 in mildly below-average turnover.Keep an eye on the chemical giant's relative strength line, drawn in blue in all IBD and MarketSmith charts. A sharply rising line means a stock is sharply beating the S&P 500. That's one key to market outperformance for your portfolio. Also, if DowDuPont's RS line stretches into new high ground, that would also be bullish.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) delivered a solid rebound, rising 6% to 2,347 and snapping a ""mild"" three-day losing streak.As noted in a Stock Market Today column earlier this week, the Bitcoin-tracking ETF is not at any proper buy point. Keep watching to see if it keeps the current correction to a reasonable decline.Given that Bitcoin Investment soared more than 1,500% last year, it's totally acceptable to see a drop in the 40% to 50% range off the 3,522 all-time peak. However, the market laws of supply and demand still apply. Over time, you want to see this and any other ETF or ETN (exchange-traded note) rise in higher or above-average trade, and fall in lighter turnover.Trading exchanges CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) could be alternatives to playing the Bitcoin trend, but keep in mind that Bitcoin futures trading activity, while increasing, is still small for both of these companies relative to their gigantic business involved with equity index, option, fixed income and commodities derivatives.CME Group, up fractionally on Friday, got a solid bounce off the 50-day moving average earlier in the week. The stock may form a new base, but for now it's well extended after clearing a 128.06 buy point in a good flat base in active turnover on Sept. 6 last year.Meanwhile, government bond investors did not ruffle their feathers following a smaller than expected increase in monthly U.S. payrolls. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond, in fact, edged up to 2.47%, meaning that bond prices fell on selling pressure. The yield is still below a 2.62% peak seen in 2017, but one could reasonably expect the yield to continue rising amid broad expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise the cost of money perhaps three more times this year.In December 2015, the Fed pushed the fed funds rate on overnight loans to big banks from a near-zero level to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%. In December last year, the U.S. central bank raised rates for a fifth time, sending the fed funds rate to a 1.25%-1.5% range.RELATED:The Bull Market Is Still Hot: What Should You Do Now?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneA Screen For Excellent Growth Stocks: Inside IBD 50How To Achieve Great Long-Term Investing Returns In Stocks: Use This Simple Routine

48,DWDP,"Leo Baekeland is the most important inventor you never heard of.That will change if cultural influencers can convey their enthusiasm for a new documentary, ""All Things Bakelite: The Age of Plastic,"" which is earning applause and awards at film festivals and science conferences across the globe. Director John Maher and his team bring alive the story of the man who invented the first synthetic material, with musical numbers, humor, interviews with excited chemists and product designers, and archival footage.""My great-grandfather had the courage to take risks and not give up in the face of repeated failure,"" Hugh Karraker, the executive producer, told IBD. ""The world changed one summer night in 1907 in his lab in Yonkers, when the first plastic settled to the bottom of a test tube. It has had a huge impact on our lives.""That form of synthetic plastic — known as Bakelite — was turned into 15,000 products that helped create the modern world, including electrical wire insulation, light bulb sockets, automobile parts, appliances, telephones, televisions and military gear. It is still used widely in everything from electronics to aerospace and led to the invention of other plastics.Baekeland (1863-1944) grew up in Ghent, Belgium. His father, a shoemaker, and his mother, a maid, were poor and illiterate, but recognized Leo's potential. At 8, he read the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin and wanted to emulate his dedication to self-improvement, curiosity about the natural world, and invention. He was drawn to photographic chemistry and at 17, won a scholarship to the University of Ghent, graduating maxima cum laude with a Ph.D. four years later.At 24, while trying to develop a better photographic plate, Baekeland was offered an associate professorship of chemistry and physics at his alma mater under his former chemistry professor, Theodore Swarts. He also fell in love and eventually married Swarts' daughter, Celine. Feeling pressure from his father-in-law, who thought Baekeland's startup was a distraction from academic pursuits, he and his bride sailed for America.Landing in New York City, Baekeland received a job offer from the firm that would become the photo giant Agfa Gevaert, which he accepted.""America was a mobile, open society where people who could prove they had the moxie to accomplish something would win out,"" Jeffrey Meikle, author of ""American Plastic: A Cultural History,"" said in the film.Two years later, the restless entrepreneur left the company to become an independent chemical consultant.By 1893, however, an economic depression had caused him to go broke and soon after he came down with appendicitis. While lying in bed near death, he rethought his plans and decided to concentrate on the one project most likely to bring him the best commercial results, an improved photographic paper for the small cameras being made by Eastman Kodak (KODK). Baekeland's Nepera Chemical Co. developed Velox, which was sold to Eastman Kodak in 1899 for $750,000, of which Baekeland netted $215,000 (equal to $6.4 million today).The money allowed Baekeland to outfit a barn on the grounds of his Yonkers mansion as a research laboratory, where he began experimenting in 1902 to try to create a commercial plastic. Electrical wires had been painted with a natural shellac excreted by a beetle, but that could melt at high temperatures. Many scientists had tried to create an artificial version by combining phenol with formaldehyde, but were unable to control the reaction that would result in a gunk that could not be molded.""He kept meticulous notes on each experiment and would try things again and again, even though everyone said what he was trying to do was impossible,"" Burkhard Wagner, a research chemist retired from Union Carbide, said in the film. ""He was extremely stubborn and where others saw a wall, he leaned against it and discovered a door. His genius was to realize that he could interrupt the chain reaction.""The result was neither animal, vegetable nor mineral: a man-made fourth kingdom, said Karraker. Baekeland decided to have it mimic his name, calling it Bakelite (pronounced ""bake-uh-lite"") and received a patent in 1909, which he announced at a meeting of the American Chemical Society. (His discovery occurred when he was 43; since 1945, the ACS has biennially bestowed the Baekeland Medal to promising chemists under 40).""Bakelite could be molded into anything, from automobile distributor caps and office equipment to toasters, cameras, tableware, and billiard balls, launching the era of industrial design and mass consumption from the 1920s to '50s,"" said Karraker. ""It was valued because it resisted scratches and solvents and was used where it was needed to withstand extreme heat, such as heat shields on spacecraft.""Of course, competitors leapt into the arena, but found themselves up against the extraordinarily thorough 55 patent applications that Baekeland was awarded in the U.S., as well as those in other countries, which anticipated the range of uses for his inventions or anything like them, said Wagner. He won all of his lawsuits, but in one case, he invited rivals Condensite and Redmanol to join him to form the Bakelite Corp. in 1923. The following year he was on the cover of Time and in 1925 was on the cover of the first issue of Plastics.""He was a good businessman, but had mixed feelings about being CEO because it was such a grind. Yet he preferred to manage his own affairs,"" said Karraker. ""The workload increased when his patents expired in 1927, resulting in a return to competing products. Bakelite was a game-changer and equally important were the manufacturing processes he developed. His work helped lead chemists to other plastics, like polyesters, polyurethanes and polyamides.""Baekeland's son, George, however, had no interest in taking over the business, so it was sold to Union Carbide in 1939. (Baekeland's part of the sale earned him $23 million, equal to $397 million today.)In 1984, Union Carbide was acquired by Dow Chemical and on Sept. 1, 2017, it merged with DuPont to become DowDuPont (DWDP), the world's largest chemical company in terms of sales.Leo Baekeland spent his remaining five years exploring botany to research the possibilities for new products, but he died at age 80 before he could achieve anything notable in that field.The global plastics industry remains enormous and growing, with total shipments in 2015 valued at $418 billion, according to Louis Pilato, a researcher and consultant with expertise in phenolic resin technologies and bio-based materials, who appears in the film. ""The cost of oil for plastic manufacturing, especially in the U.S., is low because of the use of fracking to fully extract it,"" he said.Yet Bakelite and its children have been a double-edged sword, the film admits, as plastic has become all-pervasive — though researchers have been developing forms with less negative impact on the environment.The 56-minute version of ""All Things Bakelite"" won the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival's Platinum Remi Award for documentary (named after Frederick Remington, whose art captured the spirit of the West). It has been screened at industry conferences from New Zealand to Norway, at the 200th anniversary of the founding of University of Ghent and the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and will be featured at the Sixth Biannual Baekeland Thermoset Symposium in Shanghai in April 2018. The producers have also been showing a 21-minute version, designed especially for middle- and high-school classrooms, and hope to distribute it to universities and public libraries worldwide.If they are successful, Leo Baekeland will take his rightful place alongside America's other great inventors, such as Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and Alexander Graham Bell.Inventor of Bakelite, the first plastic, which revolutionized consumer and industrial product design.Overcame: Poverty and lack of business opportunity before he moved to America.Lesson: Creative persistence in the face of repeated failures can achieve great results.""The religion of science is the worship of truth and the worship of truth is the worship of God.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:How Harley-Davidson's Founders Hogged The Motorcycle MarketSupermodel Kathy Ireland Became A Role Model For MogulsMeet The Man Best Buy Hired To Take On Amazon'Shark' Daymond John Wrapped His Brand In Hip-Hop Mystique

69,DWDP,"Trade disputes between the two biggest economies escalated after the United States and China engaged in a tariff war. In his pledge to punish the alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property, Trump finally unveiled the list of $50 billion worth of Chinese goods targeted for 25% tariff to be applied in two phases.The first round of tariff will apply to 818 imported Chinese goods worth $34 billion, including auto, electric cars, aerospace, communications tech, new materials and robotics and will go into effect on Jul 6. The second wave of 284 goods worth another $16 billion is under review and will go into effect after a public comment. This includes semiconductors, and a broad range of electronics and plastics related to China's Made in China 2025 strategic plan, aiming to dominate the emerging high-technology industries that will drive future economic growth for China (read: Trump, Tariff & Geopolitics Lead May: 10 Top ETF Stories).In retaliation, the second-largest country announced that it will slap a 25% tariff on 659 American goods for a similar amount. The list of goods was more than six-fold from an earlier version released in April. Penalties on 545 American goods worth $34 billion will be effective Jul 6 and targets agricultural products, autos and seafood. The 545 products include lobsters, soybeans, electric cars, orange juice, whiskey, salmon and cigars, according to the Ministry of Finance. Notably, most items are food and other farm goods hitting American farmers the most.The new tariffs will hit hard the American seafood industry. The United States imported more than $2.7 billion in Chinese seafood, and exported more than $1.3 billion to China last year. In particular, the Maine lobster industry will be hurt the most as it was worth more than $430 million at the docks last year. Chinese imports of American lobster have grown exponentially in recent years, rising to $142.4 million last year from $108.3 million in 2016. Then, Salmon is the biggest seafood item being exported to China and accounted for $318.5 million of the total seafood last year.The implementation date for the remaining 114 products will be announced later and will include chemical products, medical equipment and energy products.As Trump threatened to pursue an additional tariff if China retaliates, he is seeking for another tariff on $100 billion in Chinese goods, according to Reuters. The intensifying tariff talks could trigger a full-fledged trade war between the world's two largest economies and hit hard various corners of the economy. Below we have highlighted ETFs & stocks from those areas:Farm BeltAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States exports about $14 billion worth of soybeans to China.

(DE  -  Free Report) could be among the biggest losers as the proposed China tariff on agricultural products would reduce demand for the related machines. Bunge Ltd. (BG  -  Free Report), an integrated global agribusiness and food company spanning the farm-to-consumer food chain, could also lose from the lower demand for farm products. Deere and Bunge fell 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively on tariff talks.AerospaceBoeing (BA  -  Free Report) would be hit hard from the proposed Chinese tariff, as it is the top U.S. exporter to China and will likely buy about $1 trillion worth of its aircraft over the next 20 years. Shares of BA shed 1.2% on the day. iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), which offers exposure to the aerospace and defense sector of the U.S. equity market, dropped 0.4%.AutoGeneral Motors (GM  -  Free Report) would be the biggest loser as China has been the largest retail market for six consecutive years as the automaker sold four million vehicles in 2017 for the first time ever.

First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF (CAR  -  Free Report)Z), which offers nearly one-fourth exposure to the American auto sector, dropped 1.1% (read: Trade War Tensions Flare Up: Must-Watch ETFs & Stocks).SemiconductorsTrump’s import tariff for Chinese products will compel American semiconductor companies to pay duties on their own products. This is because chips are manufactured in the United States but are shipped to the Asian nation for assembly, testing and packaging due to its favorable labor costs, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Some of these chip stocks include Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report).

75,DWDP,"The Dow endured a particularly tough week, ending with marginal gains for the first time only on Thursday. During the early half of the week, strong earnings results failed to boost investor sentiment. Trade and inflation related fears weighed on investors over most of the week. The Fed refrained from raising rates but market watchers remained concerned over its future actions.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow decreased 0.1% on last Friday after gaining over two consecutive winning sessions. Strong earnings results from large-cap technology and Internet boosted investors’ sentiment in the mid-day trading.However, the markets shed most of their gains as soft U.S. GDP data and tepid earnings reports from energy sector tumbled the stocks. The blue-chip index fell in the negative territory primarily due to tepid earnings results from Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report).The Dow lost 0.6% over last week. Investors remain concerned that iPhone sales may come in below expectations in the second quarter.

Slide into the healthcare and industrial stocks more than offset gains from several merger and acquisitions (M&A) except a telecom mega deal. Moreover, strong first quarter earnings results also failed to uplift investor sentiment.The Dow gained 0.3% during the month of April. Strong earnings results by most of the large U.S. corporates failed to encourage investors. Disappointing guidance by Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM  -  Free Report), the largest contract chipmaker worldwide, led to losses for tech majors. Rising bond yields also dented investors’ confidence.The index lost 0.3% on Tuesday with 9 of the 30-stocks in the index closing in the green while 20 traded in the red. During the trading session, the blue-chip index was once down 1%, nearly touching its lowest close since April 2.The index declined 0.7% on Wednesday. Markets were up in the early hours of trading buoyed by the Fed’s decision to keep monetary policy unchanged. However, the broader-market lost momentum later in the day on news of further escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict. Strong earnings results from Apple also failed to boost market sentiment as investors remain concerned about inflationary pressures.The index gained 0.02% on Thursday even as investors remained uneasy ahead of Friday’s official jobs report. Earlier in the day, the Dow was down by nearly 400 points, moving below its 200-day moving average, the first such occurrence since early April. However, it recovered subsequently to post marginal gains as fears related to trade and uncertainty over the Fed’s future actions weighed on sentiment. Components Moving the Index Apple Inc.

77,DWDP,"The Justice Department granted antitrust approval on Tuesday for Bayer’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) proposed acquisition of Monsanto , after requiring the German giant to divest roughly $9 billion worth of assets and businesses. So let’s dive into a quick overview of everything investors need to know about the deal.Brief Background Bayer is a Leverkusen, Germany health care, pharmaceutical, and agriculture conglomerate that is currently a major force in the pesticide industry and employs almost 100,000 people worldwide. St. Louis-based Monsanto is a world leader in seeds and crop genes. Therefore, at the moment, Bayer is much bigger in Europe and Asia, while Monsanto’s presence in North America is huge.The roughly $66 billion merger was initially announced in September 2016, and would make Bayer the world’s largest supplier of pesticides and seeds. Bayer received antitrust approval from the EU on March 21. The DOJ’s approval was one of the last remaining regulatory hurdles to jump in order for Bayer to officially buy Monsanto.The move also comes after Dow Chemical and DuPont (DWDP  -  Free Report) successfully completed their merger last September. Meanwhile, investors await news about AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) acquisition of Time Warner , with a federal judge expected to hand down a decision by June 12.DOJ Approval The DOJ announced that it required Bayer to move on from $9 billion of assets businesses, which the department said in an official statement was the “largest merger divestiture ever required by the United States.”The antitrust division was reviewing Bayer’s acquisition based on the idea that it would lead to higher seed prices and negatively impact both farmers and consumers. “Without the agreed-to divestitures, the proposed merger would likely result in higher prices, lower quality, and fewer choices across a wide array of seed and crop protection products. The merger also threatened to stifle the innovation in agricultural technologies that has delivered significant benefits to American farmers and consumers.”Bayer must now divest its businesses that compete with Monsanto. The list of businesses Bayer must divest includes: cotton, canola, soybean, and vegetable seed businesses, along with Bayer’s Liberty herbicide business—which the DOJ noted is a key competitor to Monsanto’s Roundup brand.Furthermore, the settlement requires “structural divestitures” and the sell-off of some intellectual property and research capabilities, in order to foster a competitive environment going forward. This includes Bayer’s relatively new “digital agriculture” business.The German giant will sell these businesses and assets to chemicals rival BASF SE (BAS  -  Free Report), which the DOJ referred to as “an experienced chemical company with a substantial crop protection business” that will “fully resolve all horizontal and vertical competition concerns.” The DOJ now believes that “American farmers and consumers will continue to benefit from competition in this industry.”Going Forward The planned merger is now subject to a 60-day public comment period. “Receipt of the DOJ's approval brings us close to our goal of creating a leading company in agriculture,” Bayer CEO Werner Baumann said in a company statement. Bayer noted in the same statement that it has “obtained almost all clearances” and now expects to receive all outstanding approvals “very shortly.”“According to the DOJ's conditional approval, the integration of Monsanto into Bayer can take place as soon as the divestments to BASF have been accomplished. This is expected to be in approximately two months.”Recent Performance  Shares of Bayer and Monsanto both opened higher on Wednesday following the DOJ announcement. However, over the last five years, both Bayer and Monsanto have greatly underperformed the S&P 500’s 68% surge. BAYRY stock is up just 11.8%, while MON has climbed 26.7%. Over the last year, investors can see that things look even worse for Bayer, which is one of the reasons that it hopes its planned merger finally goes through after two years of speculation and review.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

82,DWDP,"Industry Rank Analysis 12-16-09
"
83,DWDP,"In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things -- a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks Rank #1 and 2 stocks than #4 or 5 ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week.
"
84,DWDP,"One industry that looks promising right now based on the Zacks Rank is Paper. It is currently in 18th place overall out of 205 industries ranked, and it climbed five spots this week. The average Zacks rank for the group is 2.35. With a total of 17 firms in the group, that is a very impressive average. Normally, the bigger the group in terms of the number of companies, the more the group average will be close to 3.00 (hence the sectors shown below all range between 2.73 and 3.21).
"
85,DWDP,"The closely related Wood Products industry does not fare quite as well, sitting in 43rd place with a 2.67 average rank, but it is coming up quickly, gaining 65 spots in the last week. The lumberjacks are OK (cue the ""Monty Python"" music).
"
86,DWDP,"Some of the firms of note in those groups that have earned the coveted Zacks Rank #1 are: Clearwater Paper (CLW  -  Free Report), Neenah Paper (NP  -  Free Report) and Universal Forest Products (UFPI). All three of those are small caps. Investors looking for a larger name might consider #2 ranked International Paper (IP  -  Free Report).
"
87,DWDP,"The Chemical industry, broadly speaking, is also showing some strength. There are several sub-industries that we track. The strongest of these was Chemical-Plastics, which was in 9th place, up 32 spots in a week with a 2.50 average rank. It is a small industry with small-cap firms in it.
"
88,DWDP,"The big boys of the industry are not doing all that bad, either. The Diversified Chemicals, which is where you find most of the big, well-known firms, came in in 41st place, up four spots with an average rank of 2.65. The Specialty Chemical industry was right on its heels in 42nd place, up 3 spots on the week with an average rank of 2.66. Some of the bigger-cap names with Zacks Rank #1 ratings from those two groups include Dow Chemical (DOW), Solutia (SOA) and W.R. Grace (GRA  -  Free Report).
"
89,DWDP,"Both the Paper and Chemical industries are very sensitive to the overall level of economic activity. Their strong ranks are more evidence that the economy is coming back.

"
91,DWDP,"Chemicals are generally used to make a wide variety of consumer goods and are also used in agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and service industries. The chemical industry itself consumes 26% of its own output. Major industrial customers include rubber and plastic products, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp and paper, and primary metals.
"
92,DWDP,"The chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years. The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic organic polymers used as plastics, fibers and elastomers. Globally, the chemical industry is mainly concentrated in three areas of the world: Western Europe, North America and Japan. The European community is the largest producer, followed by the U.S. and Japan.
"
93,DWDP,"Chemicals are a nearly $3 trillion global business, and the European Union (EU) and U.S. chemical companies are the world's largest producers.
"
94,DWDP,"The US chemical industry produces 19% of the world’s chemicals output, amounting to $689 billion. The industry directly employs over 800,000 people nationwide. A total of nearly 5.5 million additional jobs are supported by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry and by the subsequent expenditure-induced activity. In addition, the US chemical industry is responsible for 10% of US merchandise exports, totaling $145 billion annually, as well as 11% of all US patents.Outlook
"
95,DWDP,"The recession had hit the chemical industry hard. As a result of lack of demand, chemical companies shelved their growth plans. With plants idled or running at historically low rates, the companies looked for avenues to streamline operations and increase productivity. Accordingly, they resorted to restructurings, plant closures and layoffs. Cost-cutting initiatives at industry majors, like, The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) and EI DuPont de Nemours & Co (DD) helped them save billions of dollars.
"
96,DWDP,"With the economic turnaround, the global chemical industry is recovering from the recession-hit lows. Domestically, chemical production volumes increased across all regions of the country in 2010, reversing the steep declines experienced in 2008 and 2009. The largest gains occurred in the Gulf Coast and Ohio Valley regions, boosted by export demand for basic chemicals and plastics. Output is expected to grow moderately in all regions in 2011 and continue to improve through 2012.
"
97,DWDP,"The growth outlook for the U.S. economy remains favorable, despite the anemic pace in the first quarter. Current expectations are for a real GDP growth rate in excess of 3% for 2011.
"
98,DWDP,"End-markets for chemical products are showing strong growth. This growth has been reflected in the earnings releases of most chemical companies for first quarter 2011. Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), for example, reported a 28% increase in sales revenues, primarily due to improved customer demand in packaging, transportation and other markets and the positive impact of growth initiatives.
"
99,DWDP,"Combined with the restructuring and cost saving programs that many chemical companies implemented last year, output growth is driving high earnings across the sector, to the extent that many companies are confident of out-performing full year forecasts.
"
100,DWDP,"Based on the strong first quarter results, Eastman Chemical Company expects second quarter 2011 earnings per share to be slightly higher than first quarter 2011 and full year 2011 earnings per share to be slightly higher than $9.Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) revenue also grew 14% year over year to $1.6 billion in first quarter 2011 driven by higher volumes across all business segments. Encouraged by the first quarter strength, the company raised its outlook for full-year 2011.
"
101,DWDP,"The company now expects 2011 operating EBITDA to be at least $200 million higher than 2010’s $1,122 million and adjusted earnings per share to be at least $0.85 higher than 2010’s $3.37, based on a tax rate and diluted share count of 17% and 158.7 million shares, respectively.The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) revenue grew 20% year over year to $14.7 billion by volume (8%) and pricing (12%) gains across all business segments and geographical regions, particularly North America and Europe.
"
102,DWDP,"Growth in export markets has been driven by several factors. These include favorable energy costs (natural gas) due to the abundance of newly found shale natural gas; and demand from emerging markets, where recovery and expansion have been the strongest. As per the American Chemistry Council (ACC), U.S. exports would grow by 9.7% in 2011, outpacing the expected 7.8% growth in imports.
"
103,DWDP,"Further, the cost-containment measures implemented by chemical companies, such as plant shutdowns, aggressive cost cutting and production improvements, should continue to bolster industry-wide margins. The resultant large cash flows could then be leveraged for growth opportunities.
"
104,DWDP,"Dow Chemical, Celanese and Eastman Chemical have long-term strong Buy recommendations, while DuPont has a long term Buy recommendation.End-Market Scenario
"
105,DWDP,"In the U.S. there are 170 major chemical companies, operating internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating. 
"
106,DWDP,"In Europe, especially Germany, the chemical, plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industries. Together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies. 
"
107,DWDP,"According to the ACC, the Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI) rose 0.5% in March 2011, following a revised 0.8% gain in February 2011, as chemical production increased in all regions, with the largest gains in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and West Coast regions.
"
108,DWDP,"U.S manufacturing sector output was up 0.7% in March, following a 0.6% gain during February. Output grew in many key end-use markets for chemistry products, including construction supplies, motor vehicles, electrical equipment, furniture, paper and plastic and rubber products.
"
109,DWDP,"The U.S. home building sector is a major consumer market for the chemicals industry accounting for about 10% of chemical demand. 
"
110,DWDP,"Nationwide housing starts declined 4.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 529,000 units in December 2010, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. While this was the slowest pace of starts activity since October 2009, further downside risks from current levels are limited. Nevertheless, the continued softness in the U.S. housing industry makes this the weakest end-market for the Chemicals industry.
"
111,DWDP,"Trends in Raw Material Markets
"
112,DWDP,"The chemical industry is a large consumer of oil, naphtha and natural gas, which are widely used as energy and feedstock inputs.
"
113,DWDP,"Oil prices trended upward throughout 2009, and in April 2011, crude oil prices averaged around $111 per barrel, though they have since come down to the under-$100 level. With current economic conditions improving worldwide, global demand for oil is rising, leading to higher prices. Naphtha prices are also expected to remain elevated relative to last year’s levels, though they have given ground lately as well along with crude oil prices.
"
114,DWDP,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy shale gas which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big energy-intensive cities. The abundant availability of shale gas is not only desirable on environmental considerations, given its lower carbon footprint relative to coal or oil. But it is also cost effective, essentially removing a key source of disadvantage for U.S. based chemicals producers. OPPORTUNITIES
"
115,DWDP,"As per the ACC, favorable dollar exchange rates, growth in emerging markets and abundant shale gas will drive US chemical exports up and China will overtake the US as the largest market for chemical.
"
116,DWDP,"The chemical companies are looking at mergers and acquisitions as an option to grow in the current economic environment. The companies are focused on exploring growth opportunities in emerging markets with strong performance in the fast-growing regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America, particularly China and Brazil. The United States expects growth to continue, albeit at a slower rate than last year. Business conditions are improving, with corporate profits and investments rising and industrial production showing solid gains compared with the year before.
"
117,DWDP,"One of the largest operators in this space, DuPont (DD), recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Denmark’s Danisco for $5.8 billion in cash and the assumption of $500 million of Danisco’s net debt. This marks the company’s largest acquisition since its $7.7 billion buy of Pioneer Hi-Bred International in 1999. The deal will enable DuPont to expand the company’s offerings in more specialized areas like biofuels and food enzymes.
"
118,DWDP,"DuPont is focused on capturing $1 billion in working capital productivity gains during the 2011−2013 timeframe. The company is also on track to achieve a cumulative $600 million in benefits from fixed cost productivity and restructuring actions in 2011. It is executing strategies for further development and growth of new products, particularly for agriculture, photo-voltaics, alternative energy and materials.
"
119,DWDP,"Dow is delivering cost synergies from the Rohm & Haas acquisition and is targeting synergy capture of $2 billion by the end of 2012.WEAKNESSES
"
120,DWDP,"The global nature of the industry puts competitive issues into sharp focus. U.S. producers have responded to competitive pressures by streamlining operations, relocating manufacturing facilities to low-cost regions closer to end-markets, and being overall more nimble and flexible in responding to market opportunities. And it is not always easy to pull this off.
"
121,DWDP,"The recent surge in commodity prices, though subsiding in the last few days, is adding to the feedstock costs for many of these producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy given competitive pressures. As a result, margins for a number of producers will be under pressure in the coming quarters.
"
122,DWDP,"Additionally, given the industry’s sensitivity to the global economy, a diminution of growth outlook will be a materially negative development. The recent turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty.
"
123,DWDP,"(In a correction to the original report issued last week, German chemical company BASF, in the first quarter of 2011, reported a net income increase by EUR 1,382 million to EUR2,411 million (+134%). The company also announced in February that it would hire approximately 2,900 employees this year.)Calgon Carbon Corporation (CCC), a leader in the activated carbon sector, faces weak demand for carbon products. The company had weak volumes in 2010 and, though activated carbon sales recovered to some extent in the last reported quarter, we are skeptical about its sustainability. We expect sales volumes in the segment to remain challenging as the end-markets have yet to recover fully.
"
124,DWDP,"There are other possible hurdles that chemical makers may have to face such as pending rule changes within US regulatory agencies. The U.S. EPA has proposed a sweeping new rule that could impose stricter hazardous air pollutant emissions limitation and other requirement on operators of new and existing boilers and process heaters.
"
125,DWDP,"According to EPA’s calculations, compliance with these rules would cost boiler owners $12.2 billion to implement and annualized cost of $4.1 billion after accounting for savings and also result in mill closures.
"
126,DWDP,"The largest corporate producers worldwide with plants in numerous countries include BASF, Bayer, Braskem S.A. (BAK  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp., Degussa, The Dow Chemical Co., EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Eastman Chemical Company, ExxonMobil, INEOS, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MTU), PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report), SABIC and Shell, along with thousands of smaller firms.
"
127,DWDP,"(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake. The original article, issued last week, should no longer be relied upon.)
"
128,DWDP,"The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) came in ahead of expectations last quarter, leading to even more upward estimate revisions. The higher outlook has lifted the stock to a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) and maintained a great value as well.
"
129,DWDP," Company Description
"
130,DWDP,"Dow Chemical offers more than 5,000 different products from hundreds of facilities in almost 40 countries. They are best known for specialty chemicals, advanced materials and plastics, amongst many other areas of business. 
"
131,DWDP,"Well Ahead of Expectations
"
132,DWDP,"On Apr 28 Dow Chemical reported a 34% increase in its first-quarter net income. After adjustments the bottom line worked out to $0.82 per share, which was 15 cents better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company has beat the street's expectations in each of the past 3 quarters. 
"
133,DWDP,"Revenue rose 10% to $14.7 billion, about $800 million more than analysts were looking for. They did get some help from higher pricing, but the majority of the increase came on higher volumes. 
"
134,DWDP,"Analysts are Happy
"
135,DWDP,"After the news came out, analysts quickly began raising estimates. The 2011 Zacks Consensus Estimate is up 30 cents, to $2.87 on 16 upward revisions. None of the analysts have pared their expectations. 
"
136,DWDP,"With 15 upward revisions and no downward moves, the 2012 average estimate rose 10 cents, to $3.46. In 2010 Dow made $1.97 per share, so expected growth rates are now 46% and 21%, respectively. 
"
137,DWDP,"Thanks to the higher estimates, shares of DOW are trading at just under 14 times the 2011 consensus. 
"
138,DWDP,"Long-Term Trend
"
139,DWDP,"Below you can see the drastic improvements to Dow's earnings over the past few years. While the estimates have fluctuated for each year, the year-over-year growth has been fantastic. Right now all signs point to the trend continuing.

"
141,DWDP,"Earnings Preview 1/28/11
"
142,DWDP,"Next week the fourth quarter earnings season is in full swing. A total of 561 firms are due to report, including 106 S&P 500 firms. So far the earnings season seems to be going well. The firms reporting this week include several icons of U.S. business, including: Aflac (AFL  -  Free Report), Dow Chemical (DOW), Emerson (EMR  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE), Paccar (PCAR), United Parcel Service (UPS), Visa (V) and Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report).
"
143,DWDP,"It will also be a heavy week for economic data, including data on both ISM surveys (Manufacturing and Service), Personal Income and Spending, Productivity and finally the all important employment report. All in all, it looks like a very busy week, with lots of news that has the potential to move the markets.MondayPersonal Income probably increased by 0.3% in December, matching a 0.3% increase in November. Personal spending probably rose at the same 0.4% pace it rose in November. Of course, if spending is rising faster than income, it implies a fall in the savings rate. Over the short term that is a good thing, but in the longer term that is very bad news. In addition to the amount that Personal income goes up, the data breaks out the sources of that income growth. Over the last few years far too much of that income growth has come from higher transfer payments from the government, and not from higher wages and salaries. Dividend income will probably rise nicely, but be offset by a fall in interest income due to the ultra low interest rate environment we are in.TuesdayThe ISM manufacturing index is expected to slip slightly from its 57.0 level last month. As a “magic 50 index, that reading would mean that the manufacturing side of the economy is continuing to grow, but it is doing so at a slower pace than it was in December. In addition to the overall index, pay close attention to how some of the key sub-indexes which cover production, new orders and employment are faring.Construction Spending grew by 0.4% in December. It was probably slightly positive in January as well.Auto and light truck sales probably continued to accelerate from the 12.5 million seasonally adjusted annual rate they posted in December, that is well off the under-10 million pace at the depths of the Great Recession, but a far cry from the 16 to 17 million annual rates that were the norm before the recession. It will be a very long time before we hit those levels again, but we will continue to see vehicle sales slowly recover.WednesdayWe get the appetizer for the employment report in the form of the ADP employment survey. Last month, the ADP raised hopes greatly when they reported a net increase of 297,000 private sector jobs. That set up a big disappointment when the BLS reported a gain of just 113,000 private sector jobs. As the firm that actually cuts the checks of most companies payrolls, ADP is in an excellent position to gauge the strength of the job market. However, its numbers are often quite different than the private sector jobs numbers that are reported by the BLS on Friday. The BLS numbers do tend to be revised in the direction of the ADP numbers, so the big differential last month might be pointing to an upward revision to the November numbers when the BLS reports.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They have been extremely erratic of late. Last week they rose by 51,000 in the last week, to 454,000. I would expect them to decline, perhaps quite sharply, this week. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have been locked in a tight “trading range."" They are knocking on the low end of that trading range, and breaking out to the downside would be very good news. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. A rate of over 500,000 signals that the unemployment rate is probably headed back up and a high probability of a double dip.Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they rose by 94,000 to 3.991 million. That is down 847,000 from a year ago. Some of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims fell by 98,000 to 4.819 million, and are down by 991,000 over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits -- currently at 9.411 million, which is down 224,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.124 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty -- having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.The ISM Services Index is expected to have slipped a bit from the extremely strong 63.5 reading in January. This is also a “magic 50 index, so we could see a very big decline and still indicate that the service side of the economy is still growing. I would be surprised at a major decline, and think we will still stay north of the 60 level, indicating still strong growth. As with the ISM manufacturing index, the behavior of the key sub-indexes of business activity, new orders and employment are at least as interesting as the overall level of the index.We get the first read on Productivity growth in the Fourth quarter. In the third quarter, it was running at 2.3%. Over the long run, productivity is probably the single most important economic statistic there is. It is productivity, after all, that determines per capita GDP, and that is the GDP growth that really counts. Growing simply because there are more people in the country does not improve living standards. However, in the short term, rapid increases in output per hour are not particularly helpful in raising the number of hours worked (i.e. reducing unemployment). Given the relatively strong growth of 3.2% in GDP in the third quarter, and the still anemic growth in employment during the third quarter, I would expect to see an acceleration in productivity probably to around 2.6%.Unit Labor Costs fell by 0.1% in the third quarter as the growth in productivity was greater than the increase in compensation for labor. That was probably the case again in the fourth quarter. Falling unit labor costs are one of the big reasons for the high net margin fueled earnings growth that we have been seeing in the recent earnings reports. Essentially all of the gains from productivity growth are accruing to the owners of capital rather than the providers of labor. Capital getting the lion's share of that growth has been the pattern for several years now, but historically the two factors of production tended to share equally in the fruits of productivity growth. In the short term, that is certainly good for corporate profits and hence the stock market. However, the resulting large disparities in income inequality are seen by many (including myself) as one of the underlying causes of the financial meltdown and the resulting Great Recession.FridayThe most important report of the week is the employment report. In December, payrolls seriously disappointed by rising by only 103,000 and 113,000 on the private side. Growth should pick up in January, but total payrolls will likely again be lower than private sector payrolls, as State and Local governments continue to lay people off to deal with their dismal fiscal situations. Consensus estimates are not available, but I would expect total growth of about 175,000 in total and 185,000 on the private side. Revisions to prior month’s numbers will also be important, and in recent months they have been upward. The unemployment rate might bump up a bit from the 9.4% rate in December. Much of the change in the unemployment rate will depend on the civilian participation rate, which fell to 63.4% in December from 64.5% in November. If it continues to decline, the unemployment rate might stay where it is, or even fall further. If the participation rate stops falling, the unemployment rate will likely shoot upwards. That would not really be all bad. The key measure will be the percentage of people who are actually working. That ticked up to 58.3% in December, but is still extremely low. The report will probably show that average hourly earnings increased 0.1% in January, the same pace of growth as in December. The average workweek was probably unchanged at 34.3 hours, the same place it has been for the last three months. Overall, that adds up to middling report. Keep an eye on the duration of unemployment numbers which remain at historically very high levels.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
144,DWDP,"Historically the best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises.
"
145,DWDP,"Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.

150,DWDP,"OVERVIEW
"
151,DWDP,"The chemical industry comprises of companies engaged in the processing and refinement of agricultural and industrial chemicals as well as gases. Chemicals are used to make a wide variety of consumer goods besides being necessary in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and services industries. The European Union and the U.S. house the world's largest chemical companies.
"
152,DWDP,"The entire US chemical industry is broadly divided into four segments -- basic chemicals, life sciences, specialty chemicals and consumer products. While most of the larger companies operate in one or more of these segments, specialized operators in niche segments are also numerous.
"
153,DWDP,"Of these, basic chemicals or commodity chemicals form the largest segment and includes products like polymers, petrochemicals, plastics and inorganic chemicals, as well as fertilizers. Polymers form the largest product category, generating the biggest chunk of revenue. It includes products like polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene and polystyrene. Petrochemicals such as propylene, benzene, methanol, ethylene oxide are the major raw material for polymer products.
"
154,DWDP,"Plastics are next in line, with application across several end-markets including packaging, home construction, containers, appliances, pipes and transportation. Synthetic rubber, dyes and pigments, resins, carbon black, explosives and rubber products are the other derivatives under the category. Inorganic chemicals include acids like phosphoric, nitric and sulfuric, as well as caustic soda, chlorine and soda ash. Phosphates, ammonia and potash chemicals form the fertilizers category.
"
155,DWDP,"Pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, biological substance, animal health products and crop protection chemicals including herbicides, insecticides and fungicides form the Life sciences segment.
"
156,DWDP,"Specialty chemicals cover industrial gases coatings, electronic chemicals, adhesives and sealants.
"
157,DWDP,"Consumer products include products such as soaps, detergents and cosmetics that are chemically produced.
"
158,DWDP,"Mixed Outlook
"
159,DWDP,"We expect a slow recovery in global chemical production after a sharp decline in the last couple of years. The recovering global economy has resulted in improved demand for chemicals in several end markets. In North America, we expect chemical production to rise notably this year, however production levels are likely to remain below pre-recession levels. Chemical giant BASF is expecting about 10% growth in the US chemical industry on the back of rising demand for exports.
"
160,DWDP,"Given that the rate of recovery in demand is slow, chemical companies have had to resort to plant shutdowns and right sizing, resulting in meaningful improvements in their bottom lines. Aggressive cost cutting and production improvements should continue to help margins in the industry. Large cash flows, which should benefit from cost-cutting efforts and healthier balance sheets should support growth opportunities for chemical producers in the offing.End-Markets Scenario
"
161,DWDP,"About 10% of chemical demand comes from the housing sector and another 10% from the auto sector. Rest of the chemical demand comes from the agriculture, architectural and industrial coatings, paper and textile, electronics and other industries. The chemical industry was particularly affected by weak industrial demand in the second half of 2008 and in the first half of 2009. The drop in production in the chemical industry has been almost in sync with lower production in the key customer industries of housing, construction, automotive, electrical, furniture and paper.
"
162,DWDP,"However, the automotive industry has started showing signs of recovery while the housing sector continues to be sluggish. We expect automotive production to be higher in North America, though weakness is expected to persist in Europe. Growing emerging markets should propel production in the paper and textile industry while the electrical industry is expected to pick up with increased industrial investment. Other industries, including food and agriculture, are also likely to gain momentum with the recovering economy. The construction industry, however, is expected to remain weak.Trends in Raw Material Markets
"
163,DWDP,"The chemical industry is a large consumer of oil, naphtha and natural gas, which are widely used as energy and feedstock input. Crude oil prices have shown an uptrend since the second half of 2009. Oil prices have now reached near 2008 levels, when prices were historically high. Naphtha prices also soared through 2009 and are expected to rise further.
"
164,DWDP,"U.S. natural gas prices declined in the first nine months of 2009, but moved slightly upward thereafter. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, average annual gas price in the US was around $4 per mbtu in 2009 and remained at the same level in the first half of 2010, considerably below 2008 prices. Natural gas prices are expected to remain weak in the near-to-medium term, positively impacting profits for North American chemical manufacturers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
165,DWDP,"The overall chemical industry is in consolidation mode, driven by the need for creating scale economies in operations and supply-chain management. Major chemical makers are expanding through mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures. While we can cite multiple examples from recent history, the more noteworthy cases are those of Dow Chemicals (DOW), Agrium (AGU) and CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report).
"
166,DWDP,"Dow Chemicals is delivering cost synergies from its recent Rohm and Haas acquisition. Similarly, fertilizer manufacturer Agrium is growing through a combination of acquisitions and organic expansion. Agrium’s acquisition of United Agri-Products is expected to drive growth through an expanded product line. The take-over of rival Terra Industries has made CF a global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer sector.
"
167,DWDP,"After a tough 2009, chemical producers remain cautious about capital expenditures. Aggressive cost cuts and superior technology have been key techniques employed by most chemical manufacturers. DuPont (DD), for instance, plans to capture $1 billion each in the years between 2010 and 2012 by way of reducing fixed costs and working capital productivity gains.PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report), a major global supplier of protective and decorative coatings, responded to the economic turmoil with aggressive restructuring and cost reduction measures, while further increasing its focus on cash flows.
"
168,DWDP,"Additionally, leading chemical companies are consolidating mature businesses and are moving to low-cost regions. Fertilizer companies such as Potash Corporation (POT) benefits from geographic diversification as nearly 60% of its total production is exported. Other chemical manufacturers, such as Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) are benefiting through diversification into downstream businesses that have helped boost revenue and margins.
"
169,DWDP,"Dow Chemical, DuPont, Agrium and CF have long-term Neutral recommendations while PPG Industries and Eastman have long-term Outperform recommendations. WEAKNESSES
"
170,DWDP,"The chemical industry as a whole remains heavily exposed to economic cycles and pretty much all of the industry’s underperformance of the last two years can be put down to the economic turmoil. The global economic meltdown led to weak industrial demand for chemicals, which led to under-utilization of production capacity, resulting in a dramatic fall in operating profits worldwide.
"
171,DWDP,"While the global economic recovery appears to be firmly in place, the recent turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty. Chemical giant’s like DOW and DuPont have significant exposure to Europe with around 25% of their net sales coming from the region.
"
172,DWDP,"Weak residential and commercial construction demand especially affected companies engaged in paint and coatings. Revenues and margins for Sherwin-Williams (SHW  -  Free Report), the largest US producer of paints and coatings, declined significantly in 2009. We do not foresee any significant momentum in earnings growth for SHW unless there is some substantial growth in macro trends.
"
173,DWDP,"Recently, we downgraded Valspar Corporation (VAL), the sixth largest paint and coatings manufacturer globally, to Neutral from our previous Outperform recommendation. The downgrade was driven by concerns over rising raw material costs and pricing pressures that are taking a toll on the company’s paint business.
"
174,DWDP,"Recessionary trends, coupled with inventory de-stocking led to a sharp drop in volumes in the activated carbon sector last year, affecting Calgon Carbon Corporation (CCC), a leader in the activated carbon sector, and Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report), the global hybrid chemical company. A continuation of weak economic trends, particularly in the housing market, could hamper the growth of chemical makers.
"
175,DWDP,"Sherwin-Williams, Valspar, Celanese and Calgon Carbon have long-term Neutral recommendations.                    
"
176,DWDP,"Key Points: Earnings Surprise Ratio (# beat/# miss) at 5.49, almost double normal Median Earnings Surprise  6.67%, very strong Year over year Earnings Growth ratio (# Pos Growth/# Neg Growth) at 0.69 Sales Surprise Ratio at 1.38 Sales Growth Ratio at just 0.37 Total Net Income for S&P 500 reported so far is 19.0%, below what those same 351 firms reported a year ago and 11.0% above what they earned in the 2Q09 Total S&P 500 Revenues reported so far down 13.7% year over year, up 2.9% from 2Q09 2009 Earnings Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 up to 3.05, up from 2.48 last week2010 ratio at 2.14, down slightly from 2.17 last week S&P500 expected to earn $566.5 billion in 2008, $704.7 billion in 2010 Bottom Up estimates: $61.62 for 2009, $76.70 for 2010 Top Down estimates: $54.38 for 2009, $70.05 for 2010
"
177,DWDP,"Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together.
"
178,DWDP,"In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
179,DWDP,"So far, at least relative to expectations, we are off to a fantastic earnings season. With over 70% of reports in, there have been 269 which have exceeded expectations while only 49 have fallen short, a ratio of 5.49. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
180,DWDP,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.67%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal.
"
181,DWDP,"Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season. For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 149 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 207, which falls short of year-ago levels, a ratio of 0.72.
"
182,DWDP,"The disparity between firms beating estimates but having negative year over year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 9.25. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.49. A similar situation, though not quite as extreme, is true for Materials. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
183,DWDP,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year over year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 351 firms that have already reported are 13.7% below year-ago levels. A total of 189 firms have reported higher than expected revenues, versus only 137 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.38.
"
184,DWDP,"On the other hand, only 95 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 255 with lower revenues, a ratio of 0.37. Put another way, only 27.1% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
185,DWDP,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
186,DWDP,"The strategy seems to be working as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with six sectors seeing more than four increases for each cut, while only one sector, Utilities, seeing more cuts than increases.
"
187,DWDP,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, the revisions ratio now stands at 3.05, its highest level in over a year and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.14 for next year.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
197,DWDP,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percent reported in mind; for some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
198,DWDP,"Overall two small sectors, Conglomerates and Business Services, appear to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile.
"
199,DWDP,"In other words, the positive earnings surprises have been widespread. The list of the most impressive surprises is very eclectic and includes Textron (TXT  -  Free Report), Dow Chemical (DOW), SanDisk (SNDK), PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report) and Peabody Energy (BTU).Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseIncome SurprisesYr/Yr

"
263,DWDP,"•    Total Revisions activity approaching peak for this earnings season
"
264,DWDP,"Analysts are responding to better-than-expected 3Q earnings by raising 2009 estimates almost across the board. Unlike the data presented above for the surprises, the revisions data is for all 500 firms in the index. Total revisions activity has picked up dramatically, and will continue to do so over the next week or two, but we are getting towards peak activity.
"
265,DWDP,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short-term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase.
"
266,DWDP,"On the other hand, the defensive Staples sector has a very high revisions ratio of 7.43, so it’s not just the cyclicals. Then again, given the great performance by the Staples on the surprise front, a strong estimate revisions performance is not surprising.The Zacks Revisions Ratio: 2009Sector %Ch

"
329,DWDP,"S&P500 expected to earn $560.3 billion in 2008, $699.6 billion in 2010
"
330,DWDP,"So far, at least relative to expectations, we are off to a fantastic earnings season. With almost 40% of reports in there have been 155 which have exceeded expectations while only 26 have fallen short, a ratio of almost 6:1. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
331,DWDP,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two -- there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.56%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
332,DWDP,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 79 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 119 which have fallen short of year ago levels, a ratio of 0.66.
"
333,DWDP,"The disparity between firms beating estimates, but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 25:1. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.52.
"
334,DWDP,"A similar situation, but not quite as extreme, is true for Materials. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
335,DWDP,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 198 firms that have already reported are 4.7% below year-ago levels. A total of 105 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus only 68 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.54.
"
336,DWDP,"On the other hand, only 57 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 119 with lower revenues -- a ratio of 0.41. Put another way, only 28.9% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
337,DWDP,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someones paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
338,DWDP,"The strategy seems to be working, as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with six sectors seeing more than four increases for each cut, while only two sectors, Utilities and Aerospace, seeing more cuts than increases. Then again, there have been no reports yet for those two sectors.
"
339,DWDP,"For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 2.48 -- its highest level in over a year and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.17 for next year.

"
348,DWDP,"Massive positive surprises in cyclical Materials, Industrial and Discretionary sectors
"
349,DWDP,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percent reported in mind; for some sectors the sample size is extremely small.  The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
350,DWDP,"Also keep in mind that the consensus is generally tighter for defensive sectors like Staples and Medical than for cyclical sectors like Materials, thus a 8.96% median surprise for Staples might be more significant than a 12.71 median surprise for Discretionary. Both, however, are impressive.
"
351,DWDP,"Overall, Tech appears to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front, with a 25:1 surprise ratio and a 7.69% median surprise, although strong arguments could be made for several other sectors. Some of the more impressive Tech earnings surprises include Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and SanDisk (SNDK).
"

393,DWDP,"Analysts are responding to better than expected 3Q earnings by raising 2009 estimates almost across the board. Unlike the data presented above for the surprises, the revisions data is for all 500 firms in the index. Total revisions activity has picked up dramatically, and will continue to do so over the next few weeks, it always happens during earnings season.
"
394,DWDP,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase. On the other hand, the defensive Staples sector has a very high revisions ratio of 7.43, so it's not just the cyclicals.

415,DWDP,"Cabot Corporation (CBT  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the market closes on May 7.In the last reported quarter, the company incurred net loss of $122 million or $1.98 per share against a net profit of $55 million or 86 cents recorded a year ago. However, adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents.Net sales increased around 17.8% year over year to $720 million in the quarter, also outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $644 million.Cabot beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missed in the other two, with an average positive surprise of 3.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cabot Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cabot Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cabot Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayCabot, during its first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call, stated that it expects the Reinforcement Materials segment to benefit in the fiscal second quarter from customer agreements along with a firm spot market in Europe and Asia. Also, continued momentum in the specialty applications is expected to benefit the Purification Solutions segment while competitive ECS pricing prevails.Moreover, the Performance Chemicals segment is expected to witness an improvement on a sequential basis owing to higher seasonal volumes and the favorable impact from price increases. However, the company also noted that the segment’s margin is likely to be adversely impacted by higher feedstock costs in specialty carbons and increased costs to support growth investments.Consolidated revenues for Cabot for the fiscal second quarter is projected to rise 3.3% sequentially and 9.7% year over year, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at $744 million.Reinforcement Materials unit demonstrated a healthy performance in the fiscal first quarter as sales jumped more than 31% year over year to $387 million. Profitability of the segment also improved owing to enhanced product mix and volumes relative to the last calendar year customer agreements, higher unit margins and improved pricing environment in China. The company expects the segment to benefit, in the fiscal second quarter, from the 2018 customer agreements and a favorable spot pricing environment, partly offset by seasonal weakness in volume in China and higher fixed costs.Sales for the Performance Chemicals rose almost 11.7% year over year to $229 million in the fiscal first quarter while profitability declined mainly due to higher feedstock costs and higher fixed costs for plant maintenance. The company expects the segment to witness a pickup in volumes in the fiscal second quarter that will be partly offset by higher fixed costs.Profitability for the Purification Solutions unit increased in the last reported quarter on benefits of a favorable product mix and receipt of royalty payments. In the fiscal second quarter, higher volumes from specialty applications are expected to be offset by an increasingly competitive MATS pricing environment and lower MATS volumes, per the company.In the last reported quarter, the Specialty Fluids unit witnessed lower profits due to a lower level of project activity. The company expects a similar level of project activity in the to-be-reported quarter, but an uptick in project activity may be expected in the second half of 2018.   Cabot’s shares have lost 11.7% over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 3.7% decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cabot is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cabot for the fiscal second quarter is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at $1.00. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cabot currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Koppers Holdings Inc. (KOP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.00% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Univar Inc.

416,DWDP,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because DowDuPont is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for DWDP in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.11 per share for DWDP, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DWDP, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.91% heading into earnings season.The Dow Chemical Company Price and EPS Surprise Dow Chemical Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Dow Chemical Company (The) QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that DWDP has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for DowDuPont, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

417,DWDP,"A host of chemical companies are lined up to report their quarterly numbers this Thursday. The chemical industry is gaining strength on the back of continued demand strength across major end-use markets such as construction and automotive and an upswing in the world economy.Improving fundamentals in the energy space — another key market for chemicals — have also acted as significant tailwinds to the chemical industry. A rebound in crude oil prices has led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy market and a favorable pricing environment for chemical products.Notwithstanding a few challenges including raw material cost inflation, chemical companies are expected to continue the earnings momentum in the March quarter as the fundamental driving factors remain firmly in place.Strategic measures, including productivity improvement, pricing actions and portfolio restructuring, are expected to continue to drive the performance of chemical makers in Q1. Cost-cutting measures by chemical companies should continue to yield industry-wide margin improvements. Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s business-friendly tax reform is a positive for U.S. chemical stocks.Per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector, which is among the Zacks sectors that are expected to score the strongest gains in Q1. Earnings for the sector are projected to surge 42.1% in Q1 while revenues are expected to move up 21%, per the latest Earnings Preview.We take a look at four chemical companies that are gearing up to report their Q1 results tomorrow.DowDuPont Inc.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.DowDuPont was formed through the $130-billion mega-merger of chemical giants, The Dow Chemical Company and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont), completed on Aug 31, 2017.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 23.9% in the last reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for DowDuPont for Q1 stands at $21,320 million, reflecting an expected 61.2% growth from the comparable period a year ago.While raw material cost inflation poses as a headwind, DowDuPont is expected to continue to gain from higher volumes, strong demand, cost synergies, higher pricing across most of its businesses and favorable currency swings in Q1. (Read more: DowDuPont Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards?)Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) will report its results before the bell.

The same for the Vinyls segment is expected to increase 5.2% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1,570 million.Westlake Chemical is expected to gain from contributions of the Axiall acquisition and higher global demand for all major products in both Vinyls and Olefins segments.

The company should benefit from strong demand across Fluoroproducts and Titanium Technologies segments. It is witnessing solid demand for Ti-Pure titanium dioxide and a more favorable demand and pricing environment for its Fluoroproducts unit. Chemours should also gain from efforts to reduce costs and optimize its business portfolio.Chemours Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Chemours Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Chemours Company (The) QuotePlatform Specialty Products Corporation (PAH  -  Free Report) will report its results ahead of the bell.

418,DWDP,"DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on May 3.DowDuPont, which was formed through the $130-billion mega-merger of chemical giants, The Dow Chemical Company and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont), posted adjusted earnings of 83 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2018, which outstripped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents.The company raked in net sales (on a reported basis) of $20,066 million for the quarter. It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19,371 million.DowDuPont has underperformed the industry it belongs to since it started trading on the NYSE on Sep 1, 2017. The company’s shares have lost around 5.9% over this period, compared with roughly 3.1% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that DowDuPont is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for DowDuPont is currently pegged at +2.91%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.11 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.08. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: DowDuPont currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to Watch ForDowDuPont gained from higher volumes and pricing and solid demand in its core end-markets in the fourth quarter, which is expected to continue in the March quarter.The company, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it is seeing strong leading indicators of broad-based growth across developed economies such as in the United States, Germany and France. Moreover, the emerging middle class in developing economies, especially in China and India, continues to support sustainable growth. This augurs well for the company’s products and technologies. The company has also realized more than $800 million in annual cost synergy run-rate from its cost synergy programs. It has raised its cost-synergy commitment from $3 billion to $3.3 billion. DowDuPont remains committed to achieve the increased cost synergy target and deliver new products from growth investments and strong innovation pipeline. DowDuPont should gain from cost synergy realizations in the March quarter. It expects to achieve synergy savings of $225-$275 million in the first quarter.The company, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it sees net sales to be in the range of $20.5 billion to $21.3 billion for the first quarter, a roughly 2% growth from the comparable quarter a year ago. The company sees higher sales across most of its business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for DowDuPont for the first quarter stands at $21,320 million.DowDuPont expects results in its agriculture business in the first quarter to be affected by a timing shift of sales into the second quarter as a result of an expected delay in growers’ final planting decisions in North America. Results in this unit are also expected to be affected by unfavorable product mix in the Brazil Safrinha season due to a delay in summer season harvest. The company expects revenues for its agriculture unit to be flat year over year in first-half 2018.DowDuPont sees operating EBITDA, barring the agriculture business, to rise 13% year-over-year in the first quarter. The company is expected to gain from higher volumes, strong demand, cost synergies, lower pension costs, higher pricing across most of its businesses and favorable currency swings in the first quarter, offsetting headwinds from higher feedstock cost. Moreover, the company is expected to benefit from continued volume ramp up in Sadara joint venture in the March quarter.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Koppers Holdings Inc. (KOP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.00% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Univar Inc.

"
423,DWDP,"Sales Growth Ratio at just 0.41
"
424,DWDP,"Total Net Income for S&P 500 reported so far is 6.1% below what those same 198 firms reported a year ago, 5.4% above what they earned in the 2Q09
"
425,DWDP,"Total S&P 500 Revenues reported so far down 4.7% year over year, up 0.5% from 2Q09
"
426,DWDP,"2009 Earnings Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 up to 2.48, 2010 ratio at 2.17
"
427,DWDP,"S&P500 expected to earn $560.3 billion in 2008, $699.6 billion in 2010
"
428,DWDP,"So far, at least relative to expectations, we are off to a fantastic earnings season. With almost 40% of reports in there have been 155 which have exceeded expectations while only 26 have fallen short, a ratio of almost 6:1. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
429,DWDP,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two -- there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.56%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
430,DWDP,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 79 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 119 which have fallen short of year ago levels, a ratio of 0.66.
"
431,DWDP,"The disparity between firms beating estimates, but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 25:1. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.52.
"
432,DWDP,"A similar situation, but not quite as extreme, is true for Materials. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
433,DWDP,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 198 firms that have already reported are 4.7% below year-ago levels. A total of 105 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus only 68 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.54.
"
434,DWDP,"On the other hand, only 57 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 119 with lower revenues -- a ratio of 0.41. Put another way, only 28.9% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
435,DWDP,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someones paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
436,DWDP,"The strategy seems to be working, as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with six sectors seeing more than four increases for each cut, while only two sectors, Utilities and Aerospace, seeing more cuts than increases. Then again, there have been no reports yet for those two sectors.
"
437,DWDP,"For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 2.48 -- its highest level in over a year and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.17 for next year.

446,DWDP,"Massive positive surprises in cyclical Materials, Industrial and Discretionary sectors
"
447,DWDP,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percent reported in mind; for some sectors the sample size is extremely small.  The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
448,DWDP,"Also keep in mind that the consensus is generally tighter for defensive sectors like Staples and Medical than for cyclical sectors like Materials, thus a 8.96% median surprise for Staples might be more significant than a 12.71 median surprise for Discretionary. Both, however, are impressive.
"
449,DWDP,"Overall, Tech appears to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front, with a 25:1 surprise ratio and a 7.69% median surprise, although strong arguments could be made for several other sectors. Some of the more impressive Tech earnings surprises include Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and SanDisk (SNDK).

"
492,DWDP,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase. On the other hand, the defensive Staples sector has a very high revisions ratio of 7.43, so it's not just the cyclicals.

514,DWDP,"DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) plans to invest around $100 million to expand manufacturing capacity and to modernize facilities at the Sabine River Works plant in Orange County, TX.  The added capacity is expected to come online in several phases starting in 2020. This investment, spanning over the next two years, will incrementally expand production to support global growth of specialty materials manufactured at the site, specifically the Surlyn, Nucrel, Fusabond and Vamac product lines. The company is also contemplating longer-term plans to invest in a new facility to further support market growth.  Given the strong demand of advanced polymers, this investment will enable both the Packaging & Specialty Plastics business of DowDuPont’s Materials Science Division as well as the Transportation & Advanced Polymers business of its Specialty Products Division to meet growing demand of specialty materials used for applications in food packaging, transportation and consumer goods. DowDuPont has underperformed the industry it belongs to over a year. The company’s shares have moved up around 7.2% over this period, compared with roughly 11.7% gain recorded by the industry.    DowDuPont is seeing strong leading indicators of broad-based growth across developed economies such as in the United States, Germany and France.

516,DWDP,"The tariff dispute, which has been playing spoilsport, has intensified with President Donald Trump’s latest rhetoric on a potential trade war with China. Trump is seeking a further tariff of $100 billion against China in addition to the already proposed $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods, targeting robotics, information technology, communication technology and aerospace.Earlier this week, Washington planned to slap a 25% tariff on 1,300 China-made products, which include a wide array of products including raw materials, construction machinery, agricultural equipment, electronics, medical devices and consumer goods. These goods belong to industries, such as aerospace and agricultural equipment, which were the key growth areas of China over the next seven years.The new taxes came a day after China hit back with likely 25% duties on 106 American goods including soybeans, corns, aircraft, and vehicles worth an estimated $50 billion, against Trump’s similar threat in response to alleged intellectual property theft. The second-largest economy has already imposed a duty on 128 American food products, including meat, fruit, pork, dried fruits, wine and aluminum scrap, worth $3 billion effective Apr 2, in retaliation against Trump’s severe tariff of 24% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports.The round of sanctions and retaliation could trigger a global trade war, hurting worldwide economy and corporate profits at big U.S. exporters. As such, several corners of the broad market and various industries are in distress. In particular, large-caps stocks, which derive most of their revenues outside the United States especially China, appear vulnerable. On the other hand, small caps, which provide true domestic exposure, should be safe and better plays in case the tit-for-tat situation turns into a full-blown trade war.So let’s pick a couple of stocks from industries on China’s hit list for a match up to see which one is in the line of fire and which is guarded well enough to survive the tariff onslaught.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) versus Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report)Boeing would be hit hard from the proposed Chinese tariff, as it is the top U.S. exporter to China and will buy about $1 trillion worth of its aircraft over the next 20 years. On the other hand, NOC would remain unscathed by the dispute. Boeing has shed 4.6% in a month while NOC has gained 4.4%. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Deere & Co. (DE  -  Free Report) versus Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report)Farming equipment maker Deere could be among the biggest losers as the proposed China tariff on agricultural products would reduce demand for the related machines while packaged food companies like Hormel could see a boost resulting from cheaper commodity prices, including soybeans and corns, on weak Chinese demand. Both stocks have a Zack Rank #2. Shares of DE are down 3.6% over the past month while HRL has climbed 6.8%.DowDuPont Inc (DWDP  -  Free Report) versus Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report)DowDuPont’s agriculture unit is expected to be hurt by price declines in soybeans. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). On the other hand, Archer Daniels Midland could benefit from reduced prices. American agricultural producers export about $20 billion worth of products to China each year. Of this, $14.6 billion comprises soybeans and the rest include cotton, wheat and corn. ADM has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) versus H&E Equipment Services Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report)Caterpillar is vulnerable to the trade dispute as it has heavy exposure to China. Meanwhile, H&E Equipment Services is a small-cap stock and does not do business in China. CAT has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while HEES has a Zacks Rank #2. Both stocks were beaten down over the past month.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report)) versus Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report)American automakers would be the worst hit from the proposed tariff and a potential trade war. In particular, China has been General Motors’ largest retail market for six consecutive years as the automaker sold four million vehicles in 2017 for the first time ever. Meanwhile, Tesla also seems to be the biggest loser as China has threatened more import tariff on electric cars. Out of the two, GM still seems attractive with a Zacks Rank #1, while Tesla has a Zacks Rank #4.Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report): A Wild CardAs Tyson Foods is the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, it is likely to be impacted by China’s 25% tariff on pork and pork products. Notably, China is the third-largest consumer of U.S. pork and bought about $1.1 billion worth of pork products from the United States last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. However, a possible duty on soybean would reduce the price of the commodity due to large supplies and thereby result in reduced cost for meat companies like Tyson. As such, Tyson is both a beneficiary and a loser in this series of tariff attack. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a top VGM Score of A.Bottom LineAll the buzz has resulted from the Trump administration, which is seeking to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China by $100 billion. Last year, the United States had a record $375-billion trade deficit with China, while China reported a U.S. trade surplus of $276 billion.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

517,DWDP,"The shale gas revolution in the United States has been a huge driving force behind chemical investments in plants and equipment in the country. And currently, the U.S. petrochemical industry is in the middle of a shale-induced investment boom leveraging access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks. However, the escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing is expected to play spoilsport.President Donald Trump, who has a record of attacking China for unfair trade practices, recently proposed sweeping tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China. The President’s decision to levy tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese goods came after a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports slapped by the Trump administration that went into effect on Mar 23.President Trump’s protectionist actions enraged the Red Dragon with Beijing retaliating with plans of imposing tariffs on more than 100 American products with shipment values worth as much as $50 billion, bringing the world’s two largest economies close toward a full-blown trade war.China on Wednesday declared that it would levy additional tariffs of 25% on an array of U.S. products including soybeans, cars, planes, beef, corn, whiskies and chemicals. Notably, chemicals comprise roughly 40% of the products targeted by the planned tariffs. China had earlier slapped tariffs on about $3 billion worth of U.S. imports.The Trump administration responded with a proposed $100 billion in additional tariffs on China yesterday, further intensifying the trade tussle between the two countries.China’s proposed countermeasures, if enforced, are likely to harm the U.S. chemical industry which is currently on an upswing.Shale Bounty Fueling U.S. Chemical InvestmentThe U.S. Chemical Industry has clawed its way back from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey and is set to ride the growth wave this year. According to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), a leading industry trade group, expects chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.7% in 2018 with capital investments on chemical projects are expected to play a key role in the growth.A recovery in manufacturing, rising business investment and a rebound in domestic oil and gas production has set the stage for significant expansion and capital investment, per the ACC.Major export markets such as Latin America and Asia are also expected to play a significant role in basic chemical production growth in 2018 and 2019. Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are also driving chemical demand across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing.The United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of cheap ethane feedstock extracted from shale. This is driving investment in chemical production projects. Petrochemical makers are significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas.New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) are boosting shale production, bringing down prices of ethane (derived from shale gas) in the process.The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities (crackers) in the United States to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost-effective way. Chemical makers including DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report), BASF SE (BASFY  -  Free Report) and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report), Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) and Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK  -  Free Report) are investing on shale gas-linked projects to take advantage of abundant natural gas supplies.LyondellBasell currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While both BASF and Eastman Chemical carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), DowDuPont, Celanese and Westlake Chemical each have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.According to the ACC, 320 new chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth more than $185 billion, 62% of which is foreign direct investment. Such investments — many backed by Federal government support — are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years.  New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream.Chemical industry capital spending continues to go up, clocking $38 billion in 2017, per the ACC. This also accounts for one-half of overall construction spending by the manufacturing sector. The trade group expects capital spending to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.But Trade War Could Dampen U.S. Investments & ExportsThe Trump administration’s actions to impose heavy tariffs on steel imports and the threats of tariffs on U.S. chemical exports by China are detrimental to the U.S. chemical industry. These moves are expected to dampen new chemical investment in the United States, hurt U.S. chemical exports and harm the domestic chemical industry’s competitiveness. All these may eventually lead to a slowdown in growth in the American chemical industry.The steel tariffs would discourage chemical makers spending billions of dollars on new projects. These hefty tariffs will lead to a spurt in steel prices, which in turn, are likely to push up the costs of building petrochemical plants in the United States that use a significant amount of steel, thereby eroding the economic benefits of these projects. As steel costs constitute a significant portion of the costs of constructing these plants, this may discourage many companies from continuing their projects.    Notably, DowDuPont, which completed construction spending worth $6 billion in petrochemical projects along the U.S. Gulf Coast last year, had raised concerns that the tariffs on U.S. steel imports could add hundreds of millions of dollars in costs to its planned chemical project on the U.S. Gulf Coast.Chemical industry groups have also expressed their discontent about the brewing trade war. The ACC recently said that China is among the most important trading partners of the U.S. chemical industry, importing 11% (or $3.2 billion) of all U.S. plastic resins last year. The trade group is worried that 40% of the products to which Beijing has assigned new tariffs are chemicals including polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polycarbonates.The ACC said that “engaging in a trade war with one of our country’s most significant trading partners is not the answer. We strongly urge both the U.S. and Chinese governments to work together to come to a satisfactory and mutually beneficial decision before this situation escalates further.”According to the ACC, out of the announced investments by the chemical industry in new factories, expansions and restarts of plants across the United States, more than half of the projects are currently in the planning stage. The trade group is worried that the trade tariffs may force investors to consider doing business elsewhere.China is one of the biggest export markets for U.S. chemicals and thus, leaves the American chemical industry heavily exposed to Beijing’s planned retaliatory trade actions. The prospects of tariffs have created an uncertain demand environment for U.S. chemical products in this major market. This is worrisome as export markets are expected to significantly contribute to the growth of the U.S. chemical industry this year and the next.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                                                                                                                                            Here's another stock idea to consider.

"
531,DWDP,"In last week's edition of Trading Tools, shipping issue Excel Maritime Carriers (EXM) was examined, as it appeared on the Zacks Put/Call Ratio Greater than 1.0 filter. However, utilizing the Zacks Unusually High Option Volume screener today, a different security caught my eye: The Dow Chemical Company (DOW), a Michigan-based manufacturer of plastic materials, agricultural products, and  you guessed it  chemicals. 
"
532,DWDP,"For an explanation of the contrarian stance that makes Schaeffer's so unique, check out a recent version of Trading Tools. Besting Expectations
"
533,DWDP,"Dow Chemical took its turn in the earnings confessional on Thursday, reporting a first-quarter profit of $24 million, or 3 cents per share - 97% lower than its net income of $941 million, or 99 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, however, the firm said it earned 12 cents per share, besting the Street's expectations for a per-share loss of 21 cents.
"
534,DWDP,"Helping offset demand issues were feedstock and energy costs, which fell by nearly half in the first quarter. In addition, the company said the closing of plants and payroll cuts resulted in savings of $270 million, compared to the period a year earlier.  
"
535,DWDP,"Though Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said he expects 2009 to be ""a recessionary year globally,"" he remained optimistic, stating ""we actually have seen a few bright spots and some moderation in the pace of decline in the industry."" In addition, Liveris said the firm is ""very seriously engaged"" with some ""very serious bidders"" for Dow's agriculture unit, Dow AgroSciences.  
"
536,DWDP,"As a result of the pleasant surprise, shares of DOW skyrocketed 18% Friday  and fueled a mad dash for call positions on the stock. Bulls Battle Back
"
537,DWDP,"According to Zacks, DOW saw nearly 38,000 calls change hands on Thursday  two-and-a-half times the security's average single-day volume of fewer than 15,000 bullish bets. Most active was the equity's near-the-money May 15 call, which saw roughly 8,500 contracts cross the tape. 
"
538,DWDP,"However, the 12.50 strike remains home to peak call open interest in the front-month series, with about 21,300 contracts in residence. In addition, the May 11 strike harbors nearly 14,500 open call positions, while the round-number 10 strike is home to more than 10,000 calls.  
"
539,DWDP,"The optimistic uprising stands in contrast to the sentiment among short-term options speculators. The chemical concern's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR)  which measures options slated to expire within 3 months rests at 1.03, in the 72nd annual percentile. In other words, near-term traders have been more bearishly biased toward DOW only 28% of the time during the past year. Word on the Street
"
540,DWDP,"Joining options bettors on the bearish bandwagon are analysts. The stock currently harbors only 1 ""buy"" or better rating, Zacks reports, compared to 6 tepid ""holds"" and 2 ""sell"" or worse ratings.  
"
541,DWDP,"However, after glancing at the charts, these skeptics could get spooked. Since grazing the 6 region in mid-March, shares of DOW have more than doubled. In fact, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 Index (SPX) by a whopping 93% during the past 40 trading sessions.  
"
542,DWDP,"What;s more, the equity is poised to close its second consecutive week atop its 20-week moving average  a trendline that, in conjunction with its 10-week counterpart, guided the shares into the red during most of the past year.  
"
543,DWDP,"Should DOW's recent rally shake loose some bears, the stock could inch higher. A reversal in sentiment in the options arena, or a fresh wave of upgrades and/or price-target boosts, could place additional buying pressure on the equity. 
"
544,DWDP,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, DowDuPont has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.2, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.2. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, DowDuPont’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.However, the stock’s PE stands slightly below the Zacks Basic Materials sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.3. This indicates that the stock is slightly stretched right now, compared to its peers.Nevertheless, we should also point out that DowDuPont has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.3, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for DowDuPont stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, DowDuPont has a P/S ratio of about 2.4. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, DowDuPont currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes DowDuPont a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though DowDuPont might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A. This gives DWDP a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s full year estimate has inched higher by 0.2% over the past 30 days on one upward revision, while there were no downward revisions in the same time frame.

Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the top 19% out of more than 250 Zacks industries, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company. Further, over the past two years, the industry has outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The overall economic recovery helped bolster demand across all markets and regions, and our strong portfolio of products and technologies continued to drive growth.   
"
552,DWDP,"Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs believes that Rohm & Haas deserves some attention.  In a February 3rd research report, the analyst stated, ROH remains one of our favorite ideas as we believe it offers considerable but more sustainable cyclical leverage paired with attractive exposure to advance semiconductors.  In our view, the company has worked diligently to streamline its portfolio and cost structure and has steadily raised net profit margins over the past 2 years, even in the face of unprecedented raw material headwinds.  Looking toward 2005, Rohm & Haas expects sales growth between +9% and +11%, which would yield annual sales of about $8 billion.  That would mark the third straight year of double-digit sales growth.  Earnings should improve significantly from 2004 to between $2.50 and $2.75, reflecting the strength of the Rohm & Haas business portfolio, geographic reach, and its products and services.

Air Products  (NYSE:  APD ) serves customers in technology, energy, healthcare and industrial markets worldwide with a unique portfolio of products, services and solutions, providing atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials and chemical intermediates.  Air Products reported record fiscal first quarter revenues of about $1.9 billion, marking an advance of +18% from the year-ago quarter.  Diluted earnings per share of 72 cents advanced +24% from 58 cents in the prior year.  It also beat the consensus by more than +4%.  The company said the strength of its portfolio, especially its leadership positions in its growth businesses, is producing higher earnings and improved returns.  Air Products felt comfortable enough to raise its fiscal 2005 earnings per share guidance to between $2.95 and $3.15.

553,DWDP,"With our relentless focus on shareholder value, we continue to load our existing asset base while delivering a step change in our productivity and maintaining strict capital discipline, said John P.

Ashland, Inc.  (NYSE:  ASH ) is a transportation construction, chemical and petroleum company providing products, services and customer solutions throughout the world.  In late January, Ashland reported income from continuing operations of $1.39 per share for the fiscal first quarter.  A few days later, the company revised the quarters result lower to $1.28 per share after reevaluating accounting practices.  However, that was still above the consensus and far better than the year-ago result.  Ashland attributed its strong performance to a robust performance from refining and marketing.  The chemical sector consists of the Ashland Distribution, Valvoline and Ashland Specialty Chemical divisions.  First quarter results for the chemical sector advanced +14%, as Ashland Distribution achieved all-time record operating income of $24 million.

The Dow Chemical Company  (NYSE:  DOW ) is a leader in science and technology, providing innovative chemical, plastic and agricultural products and services to many essential consumer markets.  Dow Chemical reported $10.9 billion in sales for its fourth quarter, which was +31% better than a year earlier.  Excluding items, earnings per share of 85 cents exceeded the consensus by about +18% while also bettering the year-ago result.  The company said its margin expansion was due, in part, to an improvement in industry fundamentals, but also stated that price/volume management and its on-going commitment to controlling costs were also important contributors.  We began 2004 determined to maintain the momentum of our drive for financial fitness, to sustain gains of 2003 and to further develop the foundation for long-term strategic growth, said Andrew Liveris, President and CEO of Dow.  Supported by improving chemical industry fundamentals, we achieved success on all fronts.   
"
555,DWDP,"The Dow Chemical Company, along with its entire industry, will have to continue contending with high feedstock and energy costs in 2005, but plans to maintain its focus on financial discipline.

556,DWDP,"Chemicals may not seem like the most exciting investment opportunity during an economic recovery.  Its not the easiest to understand either.  However, chemicals are an important ingredient in millions of household and industrial products, and many analysts believe the industry will ride the coattails of this recovery to regain a level of prominence in the market.  What can be more exciting than that?  At present, the specialty chemicals industry has a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.86, which places it 80th out of more than 200 industries.  Also, diversified chemicals have a ranking of 2.89, or 85th out of more than 200 industries.  Chemicals had been among the hardest hit during the economic slowdown, but the right moves during this economic rebound could spark a profitable reaction in your portfolio.  But youll need help 
"
557,DWDP,"The main reason for the chemical industrys resurgence is the improvement in the manufacturing economy, which has improved demand.   The Dow Chemical Company  (NYSE:  DOW ) and  Rohm and Haas  (NYSE:  ROH ), both profiled below, cited the economic recovery for their strong quarterly reports, which included earnings per share that easily topped Wall Streets expectations.  According to the Institute for Supply Management, Junes PMI registered 61.1%, marking the 13th consecutive month of growth for the manufacturing economy.  (A reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding.)  This manufacturing growth, coupled with the cost-cutting during the downturn, have caused substantial improvements in the operating results of many chemicals companies, culminating in a solid performance for the industry in the first quarter.  
"
558,DWDP,"Of course there are still challenges for the chemicals industry, namely high raw materials costs.  Energy prices remain sky high and many companies in the space are remaining cautious despite strong quarterly reports.  However, the robust industrial recovery is providing a lot of cover for chemical companies.  Many analysts believe as long as that recovery stays on track, and the industry is able to offset the high costs, than the space should be able to keep their balance sheets strong and ride the storm out.   
"
559,DWDP,"As far as investments are concerned, chemicals is not the easiest space to grasp.  Chemicals are used in the paint you put on your walls to the food you put in your mouth, and everywhere in between.  You may want to consult a scientist to understand the ins and outs of a particular chemical group, but he or she might not be the best help when it comes to making an investment.  Luckily, investors have Wall Street analysts that can help in that regard, and given the technical aspect of the industry, their insight can be paramount.  An improving economy and analyst research are two important factors in a successful investment, and the chemicals industry may serve as a good catalyst to fulfill your profit equation.

The company serves customers in more than 180 countries and a wide range of markets that are vital to human progress, including food, transportation, health and medicine, personal and home care, and building and construction, among others.  Dow Chemical experienced significant earnings improvement in its first quarter by reporting 50 cents per share.  The result exceeded the year-ago total of 9 cents many times over and beat the consensus by more than +16%.  Broad-based economic recovery in the first quarter resulted in increased volume in all operating segments and geographic areas, said J. Pedro Reinhard, Executive Vice President and CFO of Dow Chemical.  In fact, this was the first time that year-over-year volume increases were achieved in all operating segments since the second quarter of 2000.  High feedstock and energy costs continued to be a challenge for Dow Chemical in the quarter, jumping by almost $100 million from last year.

The company has built leading positions in key growth markets such as semiconductor materials, refinery hydrogen, home healthcare services, natural gas liquefaction, and advanced coatings and adhesives.  Air Products benefited from an improving manufacturing environment in its fiscal second quarter, which helped diluted earnings per share rise to 62 cents, which was enough to match the consensus.  Revenue came in at about $1.86 billion, marking an +18% improvement from the prior year thanks to strong volumes across its Gases and Chemicals segments, acquisitions, and favorable currency effects.  Gases segment sales advanced +14% year-over-year to $1.28 billion while Chemicals segment sales increased +21% to $483 million.  Air Products said the strong volume gains in the first half of the year, along with improving manufacturing in North America and Asia, should help earnings to improve in the second half of the fiscal year.  John P. Jones, Chairman and CEO of Air Products, stated, Our continued earnings improvement is evidence that the strategies we embarked upon a few years ago are working and delivering value for Air Products shareholders and customers.  To learn more about Air Products & Chemicals, Inc., click  APD .

Eastman Chemical will report its second quarter numbers on July 29th.  In late April, the company put together a solid first quarter, which included diluted earnings of 52 cents per share, excluding items.  That result topped the consensus by 20 cents, or more than +62%.  In addition, sales revenue of $1.6 billion improved by +11% year-over-year things mainly to higher sales volume, favorable foreign currency exchange rates, and higher selling prices.  Brian Ferguson, Chairman and CEO of Eastman Chemical, stated, Our first quarter results clearly indicate that we are making progress toward improving profitability of the company.  The strong performance reinforces our resolve for taking the necessary actions to continue to improve the companys financial results.  As for the second quarter, Eastman Chemical expects strong sales volume thanks to the improving economic conditions and normal seasonality.

An improving global economy sparked higher demand across most of its businesses in the first quarter, helping to send sales up +14% to $1.83 billion.  A favorable impact of currencies also helped sales, which along with the demand, more than offset the impact of higher raw materials.  Earnings from continuing operations reached 51 cents per share, excluding items, which easily surpassed the year-ago performance of 37 cents while topping the consensus by more than +18%.  Raj L. Gupta, Chairman and CEO of Rohm and Haas, stated, We expect to continue to see higher demand as a result of the continuing economy recovery, as well as gains made through market share and new products we are introducing into the marketplace.  The sales growth, along with tight cost controls and a moderating raw materials environment, should bring full-year earnings in the $1.95 to $2.10 range.

563,DWDP,"Benchmarks closed in the red for the third consecutive trading day on Wednesday following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. President Trump is expected to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese imports and announced that U.S.’s trade deficits with China will be reduced significantly. Shares of Dow component Boeing declined after investors fretted that a possible trade war between the two biggest economies may push China to retaliate, which may adversely affect the company. Boeing’s performance weighed on broader markets, with the Dow registering a one-day decline of around 250 points.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1%, or 246.74 points, to close at 24,758.12. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% to close at 2,749.48. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,496.81, losing 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 3.9% to close at 16.99. A total of 6.53 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.14 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Trump To Initiate Trade War With China?Per U.S. Census Bureau data, the United States posted a trade deficit of $375 billion with China last year, which was two-thirds of the economy’s trade gap of $566 billion. In contrast, China registered trade surplus of $276 billion during the same period, which was also two-thirds of the second biggest economy’s trade surplus of $422.5 billion.Last Wednesday, President Trump tweeted that the U.S. is looking to reduce its trade deficit by $1 billion.  A White House spokesperson later clarified that the exact amount was around $100 billion. Additionally, Trump reportedly said that the U.S. is looking to impose “tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports,” with Chinese telecommunications, apparel and technology sectors likely bearing most of the brunt.Following this development, a trade war is likely to break out between the United States and China. Investors fear that The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) might be the primary target of Chinese retaliation. The aircraft manufacturer projected last September that China may invest about $1 trillion over the next 20 years to acquire aircraft from the company.Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5% on Wednesday, weighing on the Dow and the industrials sector of the S&P 500. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) declined 1.1%, becoming the second biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings, including 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) fell 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively.Additionally, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) decreased 1.3% and was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Two of its main components, DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) and Praxair, Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) declined 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Praxair has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PPI Increase Less Than January’s, Retail Sales FallIn economic news, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) for finished goods increased 0.2% in February. This increase was slightly higher than the consensus estimate of 0.1%, but fell short of January’s rise of 0.4%. Core PPI rose 0.2% in February, in line with January’s movement. Subdued PPI number along with in line consumer price inflation data reduced concerns over the pace of Fed rate hikes this year.Additionally, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that retail sales fell 0.1% last month, in contrast to the consensus estimate of 0.4% increase. Retail sales fell for third straight month, indicating that consumer spending will fall in the first quarter of this year. However, core retail sales increased 0.1%, which are closely correlated with the consumer spending component of the GDP.Stocks That Made HeadlinesV.F.

564,DWDP,"Finally, the dragon is ready to take on the eagle in the raging import tariff issue. Though the Asian country initially announced $3 billion worth of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, it matched the tariff value (more than $50 billion) this week with the United States and declared that it will levy tariffs on more than 100 American products. The move came after the United States proposed $50 billion tariffs on 1,300 Chinese products (read: 8 Must-Watch ETFs if Trump Slams Tariffs on China by Friday).Notably, Beijing’s retaliatory tariffs target U.S. agricultural and food exports considerably. The product list comprises yellow soybean, black soybean, corn, corn flour, other wheat and mixed wheat, different kinds of fresh and cold beef, dried cranberries, frozen orange juice, non-frozen orange juice and whiskies.The move was expected only. After all, China purchases about half of the U.S. soybean and the country is the second-largest buyer of American cotton. Needless to say, funds like Teucrium Soybean Fund (SOYB  -  Free Report), Teucrium Corn ETF (CORN  -  Free Report), iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN and iPath Bloomberg Livestock SubTR ETN COW will be in focus now. SOYB and CORN were down more than 1.8% and 1.9%, respectively, on Apr 4.Will These Agriculture Stocks Hit a Wall? DowDuPont Inc (DWDP  -  Free Report) fears its agriculture unit could be hurt by the rising trade qualms as there could be “price declines in the total market” for soybeans, quoted on Reuters. Agricultural machinery maker Deere & Co (DE  -  Free Report) lost about 2.9% on Apr 4. Soybean exporter Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM  -  Free Report) and another agribusiness Bunge Limited (BG  -  Free Report) gained on Apr 4 but could be in focus as long as trade talks take the center stage.Will Meat Producers Benefit?Along with analysts like Mizuho’s Jeremy Scott, we too believe that if prices of soybeans and corns fall, the feed cost of meat producers will decline. This could help meat producers to benefit on margins in a difficult operating environment.Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), which is the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, may gain from this logic. Shares of TSN were up 2.3% on Apr 4. Livestock ETFs COW (up 3.3% on Apr 4) and iPath Pure Beta Livestock ETN  (up more than 2.6% on Apr 4) may benefit from a likely decline in feed costs.How Will These Country ETFs Behave? Several country ETFs are poised to cash in on China’s up to 25% tariff on U.S. agriculture. Australia is one of the likely beneficiaries as Beijing can now turn to it for wine as well as nut and fruit requirements. Beijing’s tariffs on American pork will lead European Union, Brazil and Canada to export more to China now. So, these country ETFs including iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (EWZ  -  Free Report), iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC  -  Free Report) and iShares MSCI Australia ETF (EWA  -  Free Report) are all under the spotlight.What About Wine ETF?China is on its way to becoming the world’s ‘second-most valuable wine market’ only after the United States. American wine exports (97% from California) to greater China in fact increased 10% in 2017. While the United States has slowly been making inroads into China’s booming wine market, the tariff can hurt California’s brewing industry.The market share loss of the United States will help exporting nations like France, Spain and Italy, but is less likely to hurt the wine fund Spirited Funds/ETFMG Whiskey & Spirits ETF . This is because the fund has a global approach and the United States accounts for only 13.5% of the basket (read: Why These Sector ETFs Are Winning Picks Now).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

567,DWDP,"The materials sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism. This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand.However, the relation between the United States and its trade partners is not so sweet right now, with fears of a potential trade war looming large. “We’ll be imposing tariffs on steel imports, and tariffs on aluminum imports. And you’re going to see a lot of good things happen,” Trump said. Trump’s America First agenda has sparked fears of a trade war, as he told steel and aluminum industry executives in a meeting about his intention to implement a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports.Trump's tariff plan ""is bad policy at a bad time and will only add to the risk of a trade war,"" per a New York Times article citing Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital.Into the HeadlinesTrump said the tariffs will be introduced as early as next week. However, it is not yet clear if any specific product or country will be excluded from the arrangement. American stocks for companies that use the metals took a beating as a result of this announcement.The U.S. measures “overturn the international trade order,” per a Bloomberg article citing Wen Xianjun, vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association. “Other countries, including China, will take relevant retaliatory measures,” Wen added.Japan voiced its concerns too. “Steel and aluminum imports from Japan, which is an ally, do not affect U.S. national security at all,” Japan’s Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters in Tokyo. “I would like to convey that to the U.S. when I have an opportunity,” Seko added.American companies have for long criticized Chinese practices, as they complain that Chinese companies dump their products at below-market prices, thanks to the state subsidy they receive. However, America can expect retaliatory measures from China, as the emerging market nation is the largest producer of steel and aluminum. Amongst the biggest concerns, China is evaluating trade of soybeans and other farm products with the United States, which might weigh on American famers and ultimately on Trump’s support among rural Americans and Republican strongholds.Adding to the agony, if the tariffs lead to an increase in raw material cost for manufacturers who use these metals, they might have to pass on a certain percentage of the rise to consumers. This in turn will add on to inflationary pressures, at a time when Wall Street is already worrying about the impact that rising inflation will have on the markets.The S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. Strong wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes. Therefore, at an already shaky time for Wall Street, Trump’s tariffs do no good to alleviate investor concerns about the markets (read: 5 ETFs to Bet on Post Fed Minutes).Let us now discuss ETFs that are expected to be impacted because of this announcement.Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials’ stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index.

568,DWDP,"The materials sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism. This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand. Manufacturing has been gathering pace globally and driving demand for metals.However, the scenario in the United States and among its trade partners is not that sweet right now. U.S. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross stated last week that the administration has got the green light to move ahead with proposed tariffs on metals and that President Donald Trump has until April to decide the future course of action around his protectionist agenda (read: Stave Off Rising Rates Anxiety With These ETFs & Stocks).Into the HeadlinesRoss recommended a possible global tariff of at least 24% on imports of steel and 7.7% on aluminium after careful consideration of all factors including import surges in recent years. Ross added that the current scenario threatens to impair the U.S. national security.  Per a Financial Times article, Wang Hejun, an official at China’s commerce ministry, said, “The spectrum of national security is very broad and without a clear definition it could easily be abused,” adding, “If the final decision from the US hurts China’s interests, we will certainly take necessary measures to protect our legitimate rights.”American companies have for long criticized Chinese practices, as they complain that Chinese companies dump their products at below market prices, thanks to the state subsidy they receive.As a result, Trump is expected to take a strict stand against this move, because he has been following his ‘America first’ agenda since his first day in office. Per a Financial Times article, in a meeting with Congress members, Trump said, “I want to keep prices down but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminium industry and we do need that for national defence,” adding, “If we ever have a conflict we don’t want to be buying steel [from] a country we are fighting.”If Trump moves ahead with his agenda, China in retaliation will need to carefully administer its moves, so as to not hurt its export dependent economy.InfrastructureMoving on to Trump’s infrastructure plans, the President unveiled his $1.5 trillion plan last week. However, a mere $200 billion of that will come from direct federal spending, whereas the rest is to be funded by state and local governments who are expected to match any federal allocation by at least a four-to-one ratio (read: Will Infrastructure ETFs Get a Boost from Trump's Plan?).Although the plan is still in its early stages, if passed, it will significantly benefit materials companies. ""For too long, lawmakers have invested in infrastructure inefficiently, ignored critical needs, and allowed it to deteriorate. As a result, the United States has fallen further and further behind other countries,"" Trump's message to the Congress read. ""It is time to give Americans the working, modern infrastructure they deserve,"" he added.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index.

570,DWDP,"Markets roared back to life on Tuesday after Dow rose more than 500 points to end in positive territory.

The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,115.88, gaining 2.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 16.1% to close at 31.30. A total of more than 12.3 billion shares were traded on Tuesday — the highest volume of trade since the Presidential elections of November 2016.Dow’s Roller Coaster JourneyThe Dow experienced a near 1,000-point swing on Tuesday, to finally end 567 points higher. This rally in the blue-chip index was its best in terms of percentage gains since the Presidential elections of November 2016. Coincidentally, the Dow was down by as much as 567.01 points earlier in the session. This marked its session low for Tuesday. Following this, the Dow rose by 600.48 points over the rest of the trading session, fluctuating 1,167.49 points in the process.DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) surged 6% and was the best performing component of the blue-chip index. On Monday, the Dow lost a staggering 1,175.21 points to close below 25,000, giving up all its gains for 2018. Following the decline, the Dow slipped into negative zone for the year. However, the blue-chip index roared back into positive territory following Tuesday’s stupendous gains.What Did the other Major Benchmarks Do?The S&P 500 amassed 46.2 points to end in the green.

However, earlier in the session, the VIX surged past 50 to hit its highest ever level since the devaluation of the Chinese Yuan in 2015.Such fluctuations in VIX have arisen due to investors rotating out of equities into bonds as stronger than expected jobs data have given rise to faster than expected rate hikes. Moreover, the Fed expects the inflation levels to meet its target rate by this year. Such a scenario reversed on Tuesday after an influx of money into equities.Stocks That Made HeadlinesSpirit Airlines Q4 Earnings & Revenues Top, Stock UpShares of Spirit Airlines, Inc.

573,DWDP,"U.S. economy has been on rally mode since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the Trump administration.Economic Scenario and Tax ReformUnited States’ GDP grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared with 3.2% in the previous quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the economy to register a growth rate of 3% in the final three months of 2017. However, U.S. retail sales grew 4.2% in 2017 compared with 3.2% in 2016, showing signs of a strengthening economy (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).     Moreover, Trump’s tax reform is expected to significantly benefit U.S. companies. Financials are expected to be among the major winners from the tax reform, as companies with a high effective tax rate are expected to have a significantly lower tax bill.Large-cap companies will be able to repatriate a significant portion of overseas earnings at a lower tax rate. For the sake of argument, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) announced its plans of bringing most of the $252.3 billion offshore cash back to the United States, following Trump’s tax reform. The repatriation is expected to generate a one-time tax payment of $38 billion (read: Profit From Apple's Big Plans With These ETF).Consumer Sentiment and InfrastructureComing to consumer sentiment, Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence increased to 125.4 in January compared with 122.1 in the prior month. It surpassed economists’ expectations of 123.1.Per a CNBC article, citing a statement by Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, ""Expectations improved, though consumers were somewhat ambivalent about their income prospects over the coming months, perhaps the result of some uncertainty regarding the impact of the tax plan,"" adding, ""Consumers remain quite confident that the solid pace of growth seen in late 2017 will continue into 2018"".Moving on to infrastructure, Trump addressed the need to rebuild America’s troubling infrastructure by a bipartisan agreement between the two parties. In his State of the Union Speech, Trump said, “I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve. Tonight, I am calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs.”Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks in the U.S. equity markets.It has AUM of $34.8 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year.

580,DWDP,"The chemical industry is riding high on an upswing in the world economy and strength across major end-use markets such as construction, automotive and electronics. Another positive for the industry is a recovery in demand in the energy space – a key chemical end-market that had been out of favor for a spell. The recovery has been driven by the rebound in crude oil prices from their historic lows.The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has outperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The industry has gained around 29.3% over this period, higher than S&P 500’s corresponding return of roughly 26.7%.Moreover, the Zacks Industry Rank of 45 carried by the Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is a testimony to the fact that the chemical industry is in fine shape. The favorable rank places the industry in the top 18% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our back testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.Demand Strength Across Major End-MarketsChemical makers continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors – major chemical end-use markets. The underlying trends in the housing space remain healthy, backed by steady buyer demand, low mortgage rates, high homebuilders’ confidence, low unemployment levels and rising rent costs.The automotive sector also continues its good run amid certain challenges, supported by an improving job market, rising personal income, improved consumer confidence, low fuel prices, impressive vehicle launches and attractive financing options.A rebound in crude oil prices has also led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy space, an important end-use market. The recent uptrend in oil prices has been supported by a decline in U.S. oil stockpiles and extension of oil production cuts by OPEC and other major world producers until the end of 2018. The recovery in oil prices has also led to a favorable pricing environment for chemical products.Strategic Actions to Yield Margin BenefitsCost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should reap industry-wide margin improvements in Q4. Chemical companies also remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify and perk up growth. Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings in the December quarter.  Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking appropriate pricing actions (reflected by hikes in chemical prices in the recent past) in the wake of a sharp rise in raw materials costs. This is also expected to support their margins in Q4.A Few ConcernsThe lingering effects of Hurricane Harvey pose a concern for U.S. chemical companies in Q4. Harvey weighed on U.S. chemical production during Q3, knocking off a sizable chunk of production capacity. A number of major chemical producers had to shutter or cut back ethylene production, leading to reduced supply of this major chemical. Some of these companies are also witnessing a spike in raw material prices, exacerbated by short supply due to hurricanes.The carry-over impacts of disruptions caused by Harvey (in the form of lost production volumes and costs related to the storm) may pose some earnings headwinds for U.S. chemical makers in Q4.Q4 Performance So FarThe Q4 earnings season has seen releases from 133 S&P 500 participants as of Jan 26, based on our latest report.  The picture so far is encouraging, with total earnings for these companies having increased 12.3% year over year on 8.8% higher sales.As per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is under the broader Basic Materials sector. The Basic Materials sector is among the Zacks sectors that are expected to rack up the strongest gains in Q4. Overall Q4 earnings for the sector are projected to climb 30.4% while revenues are expected to spike 18.9%.How to Pick the Winners?Given the large number of players operating in the chemicals space, picking the right stocks is apparently not an easy task. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple.

Strong growth in semiconductors and consumer electronics is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.The company also expects its agriculture business to return to growth in the fourth quarter with sales growing around 10% on a year over year basis, supported by increased fungicide sales, higher corn volumes in Latin America and portfolio benefits.

These include workforce reductions, buildings and facilities consolidations and select asset shutdowns.

Post the mayhem caused by the recent natural disasters, the company does not anticipate any further decline in the level of raw material cost inflation. In the third quarter, currency exchange translation had favorable impact on the company’s performance and is expected to remain a tailwind in the to-be-reported quarter.  Furthermore, the company sees an additional increase in selling price. Also, it remains on track with its restructuring program that is expected to deliver savings of more than $45 million for full-year 2017.  PPG Industries is also taking steps for growing organically as well as cutting costs. The company also remains committed to deploy cash on acquisitions and share repurchases. The company’s board, last month, authorized it to buyback outstanding common stock worth $2.5 billion. However, lingering impacts of natural disasters (hurricanes and earthquakes) may continue to affect sales volume and margins in the fourth quarter. PPG Industries expects natural disasters to unfavorably impact fourth-quarter earnings by up to 5 cents per share. Some raw material inflation is also expected in the fourth quarter due to supply related issues. For the company’s the Industrial Coatings segment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is expected to be $1,523 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an estimated 2.5% rise on a sequential comparison basis. Segment income is also expected to increase 7.1% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $240 million for the fourth quarter. Net sales for PPG Industries’ Performance Coatings segment, for the fourth quarter is expected to witness a 10.1% decline from the previous quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues for the unit is pegged at $2,059 million. Segment income is also expected to decline 35.1% sequentially as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $237 million for the fourth quarter. The segment is expected to be affected by the adverse impact of natural disasters.PPG Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PPG Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PPG Industries, Inc.

591,DWDP,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies offering high dividends.JPMorgan U.S. Dividend ETF JDIV tracks the JP Morgan US Dividend Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility and yield. It has AUM of $25.2 million and seeks to provide exposure to higher-yielding equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in Dowdupont Inc DWDP, Hollyfrontier Corp (HFC  -  Free Report) and Digital Realty Trust Inc DLR, with 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all just a little over 7.5% is allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Utilities, Financials and Consumer Goods, with 15.9%, 15.0% and 14.2% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017).Market ImpactMoreover, markets anticipate an interest rate hike in the December meeting of the Fed. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 91.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike and 8.5% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike in December. This fund is expected to be significantly impacted because higher interest rates reduce the appeal of dividend-focused funds. However, Janet Yellen has warned that faster rate hikes might cause inflation to go below the Fed’s 2% target. Moreover, newly elected Fed chair, Jerome Powell, is seen as a dovish lead, who will not steer much from the current policy.There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s tax reform and deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to dividend-focused funds.CompetitionThe fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space.

593,DWDP,"Markets ended lower on Tuesday after shares of GE declined for the second straight day. Moreover, oil prices declined after International Energy Agency slashed its global crude-demand forecasts. This factor also weighed on the broader markets. Further, lingering tax-reform woes also dampened investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren commented that the Republican tax plan would eventually lead to an economic slowdown.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) decreased 0.1%, to close at 23,409. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.2% to close at 2,578.87. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,737.87, declining 0.3%. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,775 to 1,054. On Nasdaq, declining issues outnumbered the advancing ones by 1,736 to 1,068. The CBOE VIX increased 0.8% to close at 11.59.General Electric and Tax Woes Weigh On the MarketsShares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) declined for the second straight day to hit its lowest levels since 2011. Shares of GE declined 5.9% on Tuesday, losing almost 12% in two days. On Monday, the company said that for the next year, the electric giant expects EPS in the range of $1.00-$1.07, which is significantly lower than the 2017 guidance of $1.05-$1.10 a share. The company also reduced its dividend by 50% in a bid to focus more on health care, aviation and energy business segments. The decline in the shares of GE weighed on the broader markets.Moreover, tax woes continued to worry the investors. Late last week, a version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focused on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Worries over a possible delay in tax cut plans dampened investor sentiment and brought about broad based losses for the markets.How Did Benchmarks Perform?The Dow shed 30.23 points to end in the negative territory. This marked the blue-chip index’s third decline out of the last four sessions. Earlier in the session the Dow was down by as much as 170 points. Such a dismal run can partly be attributed to the decline in GE’s shares. Further, shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and DowDuPont (DWDP  -  Free Report) were all down 0.1%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 2.2%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq lost 19.72 points to also end in the red. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Further, the S&P 500 closed almost 6 points lower, with eight of its 11major sectors ending in losses. The S&P 500 has also finished three of the past four sessions in the red. Decliners were led by energy shares, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) dwindling 1.6%. Energy shares tanked following the release of a report by International Energy Agency in which the global body slashed global crude-demand forecasts and stated that U.S. shale-oil production will witness a boom in the near future. Such comments led to a decline in oil prices.Political Drama Keeps Investors ConfusedSpeaking at a Center for American Progress Action Fund event, Democrat Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren warned of a possible economic slowdown on Tuesday if the Republican tax plan is implemented. She reasoned that such a plan would squeeze the tax revenues for infrastructure and retard economic growth.She also stated that the terms of the plan would actually lead to small business owners subsidizing big companies which in turn would lead to a crunch in tax revenues. Such comments from her come at a time when the investors are already battling tax-reform worries.Meanwhile, reports also surfaced from Wall Street Journal that the White House was considering Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz as a possible candidate for the second best job at tje Federal Reserve. Trump has already nominated Jerome Powell to fill in Yellen’s shoes post her retirement in February next year.

594,DWDP,"The latest research conducted by the National Cancer Institute (‘NCI’) confirmed that Monsanto Company’s  divisive herbicide — Roundup — is not carcinogenic. The company’s share price moved up to $118.15 on Nov 13, after the news surfaced last Thursday.Roundup’s Glyphosate is Non-CancerousMonsanto’s Roundup is a widely used weed killer in the United States. Several studies conducted over the last few years claimed that its primary ingredient — glyphosate — poses health problems to mankind by causing cancer. For instance, in 2015 a study conducted by the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer characterized glyphosate as probably carcinogenic. Notably, critics also viewed this chemical as harmful to the environment. Such arguments forced countries like Sri Lanka and Colombia to completely ban Roundup’s aerial spray.However, some studies contradicted the industry-wide concern and stated that there is no significant relationship between cancer and glyphosate usage. The European Food Safety Authority noted that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. In March 2017, the European Chemical Agency confirmed that the Roundup weed killer is entirely safe for public use.The NCI collected long-term data from the Agricultural Health Study for monitoring the health status of roughly 90,000 individuals in North Carolina and Iowa from 1993 to 2010. The result revealed that there is no linkage between glyphosate and cancer.Agro-Chemical Industry in Focus  Amid concerns like volatile demand and input cost pressure, the global seed, traits and agricultural chemical industry is anticipated to gain momentum on the back of shale gas revolution in the United States. Per the American Chemistry Council, the U.S. shale boom has carved path for 310 new chemical projects. New provisions of natural gas have captured chemical investors’ attention in the country. Moreover, the rebounding construction market and a resilient automotive sector are expected to propel this industry’s near-term growth. We note that the Zacks Agricultural Products industry is currently placed at the top 30% out of the 256 Zacks Industries.However, we also notice that new profit-making opportunities have triggered the degree of Monsanto’s business rivalry with the worldwide agricultural chemical market. There is an ongoing trend of consolidation in the contemporary seed, trails and Zacks Agricultural Products. Swiss giant Syngenta AG  was successfully acquired by ChemChina for $43 billion in June 2017. Furthermore, in September 2017, The Dow Chemical Company and DuPont joined forces to form the DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report).Monsanto Displays Robust GrowthMonsanto currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. Over the last year, shares of this company yielded a return of 19.2%, outperforming 16.9% growth recorded by the industry.Monsanto anticipates its fiscal 2018 earnings will likely be stronger on the back of improved Intacta penetration and pricing in South America, gains secured from the Precision Planning business spin-off (Sep 5, 2017) and increased Agriculture Productivity segment’s gross profit. We believe the aforementioned NCI declaration will increase Roundup’s sales and thus boost Monsanto’s near-term results.In addition, Monsanto accepted Bayer AG’S (BAYRY  -  Free Report) buyout offer worth $66 billion, inclusive of debt, in September 2016. The company believes that the deal will likely open up a number of new business opportunities going forward.Monsanto’s earnings per share are predicted to be up 12.1% in the next three to five years.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

595,DWDP,"The materials sector is garnering a lot of investor attention lately. Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism. This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand. Manufacturing has been picking up pace globally and driving demand for metals.Cause for AppealOn Oct 19, the Senate passed a budget of $4 trillion in a 51-49 vote, which will allow the Republicans to move ahead with the tax cuts with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote supermajority that is generally required. Moreover, this has increased investor optimism about President Donald Trump delivering on his promises of greater infrastructure spending, which is expected to give a boost to the materials sector (read: GOP Nears Tax Reform: Buy These ETFs).Per the Commerce department, construction spending increased 0.3% in September on a monthly basis to $1.22 trillion. It grew 2% on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, strong earnings performance has contributed to gains in the sector. U.S. economic fundamentals seem to be strong. GDP increased 3% annually in the July-September period compared with a 3.1% increase in the third quarter.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $4.4 billion and charges a moderate fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 25 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 68.7% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Chemicals, Containers & Packaging and Metals & Mining, with 72.9%, 13.2% and 9.2% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report), Monsanto Co.  and Praxair Inc (PX  -  Free Report) with 22.9%, 8.0% and 6.5% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 7, 2017).  The fund has returned 26.4% in a year and 18.0% year to date (as of Nov 7, 2017). XLB has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF (IYM  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Index. It has AUM of $967.3 million and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year. It has 50 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 66.5% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Diversified Chemicals, Specialty Chemicals and Fertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals, with 28.6%, 22.7% and 12.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 6, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are DowDuPont Inc., Monsanto Co. and Praxair Inc with 24.2%, 7.8% and 6.2% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 6, 2017). The fund has returned 28.7% in a year and 19.3% year to date (as of Nov 7, 2017). IYM has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook.Bottom LineXLB is more popular than IYM, as is evident from its higher AUM. Moreover, it also may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  However, IYM has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.Moreover, both the funds have had relatively similar year-to-date performance. IYM returned 1.3% more than XLB so far this year whereas in a year, IYM outperformed XLB by 2.3%. With growing developments in the sector, these ETFs are poised to offer great growth potential. However, since the factors driving growth in this sector are still exposed to a great deal of uncertainty, a more popular ETF like XLB might help alleviate some of the political uncertainties prevailing in the region.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

597,DWDP,"DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) logged a profit (on a reported basis) of roughly $514 million or 32 cents per share in third-quarter 2017, down around 29% from a profit of $719 million or 63 cents per share recorded in the comparable period a year ago.Barring one-time items, earnings came in at 55 cents per share for the quarter, which were in line the Zacks Consensus Estimate.DowDuPont raked in net sales (on a reported basis) of $15,354 million, up roughly 23% year over year.

The company also saw a 3% rise in adjusted local prices on gains in all geographic areas barring Latin America.Higher volumes and pricing, solid demand in most of the company’s core end-markets coupled with increased equity earnings more than offset higher feedstock costs, weak agriculture market conditions and unfavorable impacts of hurricanes in the reported quarter.DowDuPont was formed through the $130-billion mega-merger of chemical giants, The Dow Chemical Company and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont), which completed on Aug 31. The company plans to eventually break up into three independent companies. This is the combined company’s first post-merger earnings report.Segment Highlights Agriculture: Adjusted net sales fell roughly 4% year over year to $1.9 billion in the reported quarter on lower volumes and pricing.

Growth was aided by strong demand from the automotive market, especially in Asia Pacific and EMEA.Safety & Construction: Adjusted net sales rose 6% to $1.3 billion, supported by higher volume with gains recorded in all geographies.Financials DowDuPont had cash and cash equivalents of roughly $13.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Long-term debt was roughly $29.8 billion.OutlookMoving ahead, DowDuPont said that demand outlook remains positive for most of its key end-markets. It will remain focused on executing its near-term priorities that include delivering earnings and cash flow growth, executing its $3 billion cost synergy initiatives and advancing activities to create three growth companies in Agriculture, Materials Science and Specialty Products.DowDuPont also declared the actions it will take to generate planned cost savings of $3 billion.

599,DWDP,"A few chemical companies are lined up to report their quarterly numbers on Nov 2.  Per the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector. Overall, third-quarter earnings for the sector are projected to decline 3.5% while revenues are expected to increase 10.7%, per the latest Earnings Preview.The chemical industry is back on the growth path after being in limbo for a spell. The industry’s upturn is supported by an upswing in the world economy and strength across major end-use markets such as construction and automotive.Despite a few lingering challenges, chemical companies are expected to continue the earnings momentum witnessed in the second quarter. This is because the fundamental driving factors remained firmly in place.Strategic measures including productivity improvement, pricing actions, portfolio restructuring and earnings-accretive acquisitions are expected to drive the performance of chemical makers in the third quarter. Cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to yield industry-wide margin improvements. Synergies from acquisitions should also lend support to earnings.  Let's see what's in store for these three chemical companies that are set to report third-quarter results this Thursday.DowDuPont Inc.

600,DWDP,"DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) is set to release its third-quarter 2017 results ahead the bell on Nov 2.DowDuPont was formed through the $130 billion mega-merger of chemical giants, The Dow Chemical Company and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont). The merger, which was closed on Aug 31, is projected to deliver cost synergies of around $3 billion and growth synergies of roughly $1 billion. This will mark the combined company’s first post-merger earnings report.DowDuPont has underperformed the industry it belongs to since it started trading on the NYSE on Sep 1. The company’s shares have gained around 6.7% over this period, compared with roughly 9.9% gain recorded by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderDowDuPont is presently operating with three divisions – Agriculture, Materials Science and Specialty Products. The company would eventually break up into three independent companies. The breakup is expected to take place within 18 months of the merger closing.DowDuPont recently provided its expected results for the third quarter of 2017. The company said that it expects adjusted earnings per share of 55 cents for the quarter, up 10% from the prior-year quarter. On a reported basis, the company sees earnings of 32 cents per share.Adjusted earnings for the third quarter exclude integration and separation costs, restructuring and asset-related charges, a tax related charge, amortization of DuPont's intangible assets and a gain from the sale of the ethylene acrylic acid copolymers and ionomers business.The company also envisions net sales (on a reported basis) to be $15.4 billion and adjusted net sales to be $18.3 billion (up 8% year over year) for the third quarter. DowDuPont noted that sales benefited from higher pricing and volumes in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the third quarter stands at $17,501 million.DowDuPont noted that it results in the third quarter benefited from solid demand in most of its core end-markets, higher prices and increased equity earnings. These more than offset increased feedstock costs, weak agriculture market conditions and unfavorable impacts of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The agriculture market faced challenges from expected lower planted corn area and a delayed start to the Brazil summer season.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that DowDuPont is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for DowDuPont is +23.60% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at 55 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 45 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: DowDuPont carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.08% and a Zacks Rank #1.

601,DWDP,"A tough economic backdrop in Europe, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. fiscal cliff, manufacturing slowdown, sluggish activity in China and weakness across some key end-markets weighed on the companies in the chemical space in 2012. The combined effect of these issues led to depressed demand for chemical products.
"
602,DWDP,"While the situation is not expected to change radically in the current quarter given the continued Eurozone problems, the industry is expected to fare relatively better this year, aided by the gradual healing in the U.S. economy and hopes of a rebound in Chinese demand. The industry is expected to benefit from strength across emerging markets and a rise in shale gas production in the U.S. The fledgling recovery in the housing market also augurs well for the chemical industry in the second half of 2013 and beyond.Industry Fact File
"
603,DWDP,"Chemicals are used to make consumer goods and are also used in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service industries. In fact, the chemical industry itself consumes 26% of its own output. Major industrial consumers include rubber and plastic, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp and paper and primary metals.
"
604,DWDP,"The chemical industry, a nearly $3 trillion global business, has grown at a brisk pace for more than five decades. The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic organic polymers used as plastics, fibers and elastomers. The chemical industry is mainly concentrated in three areas of the world: Western Europe, North America and Japan. Europe is the largest producer, followed by the U.S. and Japan.
"
605,DWDP,"The U.S. chemical industry represents more than 15% of the global chemical output and employs nearly 800,000 people. It constitutes roughly 12% of the nation's exports, aggregating $187 billion annually. Roughly 5.5 million additional jobs are backed by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry. The U.S. chemical industry supports roughly 25% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP).
"
606,DWDP,"The chemical industry is cyclical by nature and heavily linked to the overall condition of the U.S. and world economy. The Chemical industry also touches 96% of manufactured goods, making the manufacturing industry the biggest consumer of chemical products.
"
607,DWDP,"There are 170 major chemical companies in the U.S. operating internationally, with more than 2,800 facilities abroad. The chemical industry is among the biggest industries in the U.S., a roughly $760 billion enterprise. It has been consistently leading the U.S. economy's business cycles due to its early position in the supply chain.
"
608,DWDP,"According to chemical powerhouse BASF SE (BASFY  -  Free Report), global chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) rose 2.6% in 2012, down from a 3.8% rise registered a year ago. The deceleration resulted from slower demand for chemical products compared with 2011, hindered by weak economic environment and subdued growth across a number of emerging markets.Industry Rank
"
609,DWDP,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
610,DWDP,"The way to look at the complete list of 260+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #87 and lower) is positive, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #174 and higher) is negative.
"
611,DWDP,"We have four chemicals related industries: Chemical Plastics, Chemical Specialty, Chemical Diversified and Chemical Fibers. The Chemical Plastics industry currently retains a Zacks Industry Rank #9, placing it in the top 1/3rd of the 260+ industry groups. The Chemical Diversified industry is featuring in the bottom one-third of all Zacks industries with a Zacks Industry Rank #187, followed by the Chemical Specialty industry with a Zacks Industry Rank #228 and the Chemical Fibers industry with a Zacks Industry Rank #257.
"
612,DWDP,"Looking at the exact location of these chemical industries, one could say that the general outlook for the chemicals space as a whole to towards the 'Negative' side.
"
613,DWDP,"Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks, which is at the core of our Industry Rank, has an impressive track record going back years, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, particularly over the short-term (1 to 3 months). The rank along with Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) (Read: Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Method) helps in predicting the probability of earnings surprises.Key Raw Material Trends
"
614,DWDP,"The chemical industry uses oil, naphtha and natural gas as energy and feedstock inputs. BASF report states that the price of Brent crude oil averaged $112 a barrel in 2012 compared with $110 a barrel a year ago. Price rose sharply at the beginning of 2012 stirred by the combined impact of higher demand and political unrest in the Middle East.
"
615,DWDP,"Brent crude, which hit a four-year high of $128 a barrel in Mar 2012, reached a nine-month high of $119 in Feb 2013, triggered by strong Chinese crude oil import data and geopolitical tension in the Middle East, exacerbated by Iran's nuclear program.
"
616,DWDP,"However, in a recent development, Brent crude prices eased to below $100 for the first time since July 2012 as reports of slowing Chinese economic growth coupled with weak U.S. economic data (disappointing New York manufacturing data coupled with a drop in retail sales) dampened the demand outlook for oil. However, a possible intervention by OPEC through a potential production cut may keep prices from sliding further.
"
617,DWDP,"The price of the other key raw material, naphtha, which is produced from oil, averaged $937 per metric ton in 2012 compared with $930 per metric ton in 2011. High crude prices kept the cost of naphtha elevated. Natural gas remains a bright spot on the feedstock front. The average annual price of natural gas in the U.S. dropped to $3 per million British thermal units (mmbtu) in 2012 from $4 mmbtu in 2011.
"
618,DWDP,"Over the last five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy, shale gas, which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big energy-intensive cities. Shale gas is not only desirable for environmental reasons given its low carbon footprint relative to oil or coal, but is at the same time cost effective.Chemical Industry on the Recovery Trail
"
619,DWDP,"The European debt crisis, weak U.S. manufacturing along with sluggish activity in China and other key emerging markets led to weak demand for chemical products in 2012. While the U.S. is not headed toward another recession, the lingering debt issue in Europe coupled with other economic uncertainties pose downside risks to the nation's economic outlook.
"
620,DWDP,"The American Chemistry Council (ACC) foresees national chemical output (excluding pharma) to rise 1.9% in 2013 (following a 1.5% gain in 2012) and 2.3% in 2014. Strength across light vehicle and aerospace markets bodes well for the industry. U.S. chemical exports are expected to rise 4.7% this year (up from 1.8% in 2012) and 6.6% in 2014, leading to an expansion in trade surplus.
"
621,DWDP,"The trade group expects global chemical industry output to grow 4.3% in 2013 and 4.7% in 2014. Chemical makers in the emerging economies are expected to deliver a 7.5% production gain in 2013.
"
622,DWDP,"The ACC expects strong rise in capital spending in the coming years, stemming from new investments in petrochemicals and derivatives. Domestic chemical investment jumped 15.5% to around $38.1 billion in 2012. The ACC envisions capital spending to reach $64.5 billion by 2017. The shale gas boom is expected to drive investment on plants and equipment in the U.S. A rebound across emerging markets is expected to contribute to accelerated rise over the next several years.
"
623,DWDP,"BASF expects global chemical production to recover this year on the back of healthy gains in the emerging markets. It expects the U.S. chemical industry to benefit from lower gas prices. Asia is expected to show strong rise riding on strength across construction, electronics and automotive industries. However, output in Europe is expected to rise narrowly due to marginal gain in industrial production.
"
624,DWDP,"According to the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), European chemical output is expected to show a modest increase of 0.5% in 2013 following a 1.5% decline in 2012. The expectation for a slim gain this year stems from the anticipated modest gain in every quarter, partly driven by export markets.OPPORTUNITIES
"
625,DWDP,"According to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry trade group, emerging market growth and abundant shale gas should help drive U.S. chemical exports. A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and strong demand from the emerging markets.
"
626,DWDP,"Affordable natural gas and ethane (derived from shale gas) offer U.S. producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive, oil-based feedstock. New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are boosting shale production, bringing down prices of ethane in the process.
"
627,DWDP,"Leveraging the abundant natural gas supply and cost advantage, chemical companies are investing billions of dollars for setting up facilities (crackers) that produce ethylene from ethane. ACC report indicated that over 50 projects have been announced by the U.S. chemical makers (representing capital investment of more than $40 billion) to take advantage of ample natural gas supplies. Such investments are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years.
"
628,DWDP,"Further, cost-cutting measures implemented by chemical companies including plant closures and headcount reduction should yield industry-wide margin improvements. Cash flows derived through these actions can be used for growth.
"
629,DWDP,"Mergers and acquisitions offer chemical companies another means to shore up growth in this difficult scenario. These companies remain focused on exploring growth opportunities in the fast-growing emerging markets, particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin (especially China and Brazil).
"
630,DWDP,"China is expected to see a recovery this year following a somewhat soft 2012. Government stimulus actions coupled with efforts to staunch inflation appears to bear fruit and exports to the U.S. and other key markets are regaining momentum. An improved demand outlook for China bodes well for the chemical industry in 2013.
"
631,DWDP,"We feel that chemical companies with strong earnings quality, healthy growth trajectories and liquidity profiles are better placed in the current rickety market environment. In particular, this is considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheets and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value in the form of dividends and share repurchases, or use them for value acquisitions.
"
632,DWDP,"We have a bullish view on Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), which is well placed to benefit from its Solutia acquisition. The company's diversified chemical portfolio and integrated and diverse downstream businesses represent the pillars of strength. It also benefits from business restructuring, cost-cutting measures and increased capacity additions.
"
633,DWDP,"Chemical titan E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD) is witnessing strength in its agriculture and food businesses. Its Agriculture segment delivered healthy sales in the December quarter boosted by higher volume and strong performance of the crop protection business. The company expects continued strong gain in crop protection in 2013 driven by new products. Moreover, DuPont should continue to benefit from the synergies of Danisco acquisition and its aggressive restructuring actions.
"
634,DWDP,"We are also optimistic about Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report), despite the challenges it faces in Europe. We like the company's initiatives to improve margins and profits by running its plants better and controlling expenses. The company's strong presence in emerging markets, especially in China, will enable it to deliver incremental earnings in 2013. We are also upbeat about the prospect of its TCX ethanol process technology.
"
635,DWDP,"We have a favorable view on Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD  -  Free Report). Impressive results from its core Merchant Gases segment coupled with Indura and DA NanoMaterials acquisitions helped it to rake in better-than-expected results in the December quarter. Air Products plans to take a number of steps including cost-control measures, restructuring actions, price improvements and volume gains. Its recent strategic moves will position it for future growth and profitability despite the soft economic backdrop.
"
636,DWDP,"In the specialty chemical space, PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) represents an attractive play. The company witnessed strong growth in its North American automotive OEM coatings business in the December quarter. Continued momentum across automotive OEM and aerospace markets helped it to post better-than-expected sales in the quarter. It has a diversified base of products and markets, and looks to grow its businesses strategically along with controlling costs.WEAKNESSES
"
637,DWDP,"Given the industry's sensitivity to the global economy, any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical companies. The turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty. Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand and the nagging impact of debt crisis.
"
638,DWDP,"The U.S. housing sector, a key consumer of chemicals, has shown signs of recovery lately, manifested by rising housing starts, increase in building permits and a steady pick-up in home prices. However, demand from this industry remains way below the historic levels. In addition, weakness still persists in commercial construction and electronics, which are among the key end-markets.
"
639,DWDP,"Chemical companies generate a considerable amount of revenues outside the U.S., and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. Currency exchange translation remains a headwind for these companies.
"
640,DWDP,"Chemical makers may also face greater regulatory challenges in 2013. Environmentalists as well as different consumer and industry groups long argued that the existing Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is outdated and needs an overhaul.
"
641,DWDP,"Recently, Sen. Frank Lautenberg and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand along with other co-sponsors introduced the Safe Chemicals Act of 2013, which is geared to limit the use of toxic chemicals linked to a broad range of diseases and place the burden on chemical makers to prove that their chemicals are safe.
"
642,DWDP,"Commodity prices, though subsiding lately, still remain a concern for many of the U.S. chemical producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures at play. As a result, margins for a number of producers may continue to be under pressure.
"
643,DWDP,"U.S. chemical kingpin The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) slipped into a bigger loss in the December quarter, clobbered by weakness across end-markets, especially in China, and weak pricing. Dow still faces challenges in Western Europe and is exposed to significant pension headwinds. Moreover, weakness in the electronics and construction end-markets may continue in first-quarter 2013 and currency headwinds are expected to persist given the weak euro.
"
644,DWDP,"Specialty chemical company Valspar Corporation (VAL) is grappling with the difficult market conditions. Persistent weakness in its Paints segment hurt its sales in the most recent quarter. Weakness in the residential housing market in Australia may continue to hurt paint sales moving ahead. The company cut its earnings forecast for full year citing a soft demand environment across some overseas markets.Methanex Corp. (MEOH  -  Free Report) put up a lackluster fourth quarter with both revenues and earnings missing expectations. Restricted supply of natural gas affected its operations in Chile, Trinidad and Egypt in the quarter. Methanex may continue to face headwinds due to curtailment of gas supply and constrained spending across its end markets.
"
645,DWDP,"In the agricultural chemical space, Potash Corporation (POT) is contending with macroeconomic uncertainties and a challenging demand scenario outside North America. Reduced contributions from all three nutrients arising from slack global fertilizer markets and lower demand hurt its sales in the December quarter. The company remains exposed to volatility in potash and phosphate pricing and currency exchange fluctuation.
"
646,DWDP,"Also, agricultural chemical company Agrium Inc. (AGU) is exposed to a soft pricing environment and somewhat weak overseas demand for potash and phosphate. The pricing environment for phosphate is expected to remain soft in the March quarter. Moreover, the global phosphate market is expected to remain weak in the near term, partly due to lower demand from India (a major phosphate import market).
"
647,DWDP,"Stocks will likely remain in a tentative mood today ahead of Friday’s non-farm payroll, with this morning’s Jobless Claims data reversing the gains of the last two weeks. The Personal Income & Outlays data this morning appears to be on the positive side, but the report’s internals likely have some transitory factors that should make us a bit skeptical of the strength, particularly on the income side.
"
648,DWDP,"On the earnings side, we got solid positive surprises from oil companies like Marathon (MPC  -  Free Report), Philips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report), Valero (VLO  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), but Dow Chemicals (DOW) came short of expectations. Overall, we have a relatively mixed picture on the data front ahead of market open, with the Chicago PMI coming out a later that is expected to give us a preview of Friday’s manufacturing ISM reading.
"
649,DWDP,"I had been skeptical of the sharp drop in initial Jobless Claims numbers the last two weeks, and this morning’s data confirms that skepticism. The data shows an almost complete reversal of the last two weeks’ gains, with initial claims going up 38K to 368K; initial claims were at 355K two weeks back. The four-week average remained essentially unchanged at 352K.
"
650,DWDP,"Seasonal adjustments are problematic at this time of the year, and that was the primary reason for the wild swings in this series the last few weeks. That said, the overall tone of labor market appears to be favorable, as indicated by Wednesday’s ADP reading.
"
651,DWDP,"I am looking for a positive surprise in tomorrow’s January non-farm payroll report, with consensus looking for something in the 160K vicinity. A jobs reading in the 190K to 200K range will provide a solid catalyst for this market to mount a fresh bid to scale the fall 2007 peak. 
"
652,DWDP,"The other data we got this morning was for the December Personal Income & Outlays, with Personal Income coming in way better than expected, while Outlays (or personal spending) a smidge weaker than expected. On the Personal Income front, the strength is no doubt welcome, but it likely reflects income being pulled forward in the month in the run up to expected tax hikes due to the ‘Fiscal Cliff’ issue.
"
653,DWDP,"There was a flood of dividend announcements by companies in the month and bonuses also likely got paid out early, which will likely show up as a sharp drop in January data. The Outlays data doesn’t carry as much informational value since we got the fourth quarter consumer spending numbers in Wednesday’s GDP report (up +2.2%), but this morning’s monthly spending gain was a bit on the weak side.
"
654,DWDP,"On the earnings front, we now have fourth quarter reports from 223 S&P 500 companies, or 56.4% of the index’s total market capitalization, as of this morning. Total earnings for these 206 companies are up +2.5% from the same period last year, with 66.4% of companies beating earnings expectations with a very healthy median surprise of +3%. 
"
655,DWDP,"On the revenue side, total revenues for these companies are up +0.4%, with 57.8% companies beating top-line expectations with a median surprise of +0.9%. The composite growth picture for the fourth quarter, where we combine the result from the 223 companies that have come out with results already with the 277 still to come, is for growth rates of +1.5% for earnings and +0.3% on revenues. This would be an improvement over the essentially flat performance in the third quarter. 
"
656,DWDP,"This has been a decent enough earnings season, particularly relative to the very low expectations in the run up to the start of the reporting season. The stronger looking beat ratios and surprises relative to the third quarter reflect those low expectations. But the quality of guidance hasn’t been that worrisome either. While guidance was invariably negative in the third quarter, it has been less so this time around. 
"
657,DWDP,"That said, expectations for 2013 have started coming down, particularly for the first half of the year. But they still seem to be on the elevated side and will need to come down more. It is interesting to see the market at multi-year highs with earnings estimates coming down. 
"
658,DWDP,"But who says the market is always right?RELATED ARTICLESJobless Claims Increase More than ExpectedTime for Frontier Markets ETFs?1500 is Just Psychological (VIDEO) 
"
659,DWDP,"The September quarter essentially mirrored the conditions witnessed in the first two quarters of the year. A feeble economic recovery in the U.S. and persistent recessionary conditions in Europe continue to lead to depleted demand for chemical products. Growth continues to struggle due to weaknesses across some key end-markets, including electronics.
"
660,DWDP,"Companies in the chemicals space saw their profits sag in the September quarter, largely due to the fragile economic conditions in Europe and weak pricing. Activity across the emerging Asian economies remained subdued in the quarter given the slowdown in exports due to weak western demand. The U.S. economy, on the other hand, is treading on thin ice given the concerns regarding the looming “fiscal cliff.”
"
661,DWDP,"While the scenario is not expected to change in the December quarter, the industry is expected to continue to see slack demand, amplified by the production disruptions associated with Superstorm Sandy and uncertainty in the U.S. economy. Nevertheless, the fledgling recovery in the housing market may represent a potential positive for the industry heading into 2013.Industry Fact File

"
668,DWDP,"The sluggish economy took a toll on growth in the U.S. as the nation’s chemical production increased a nominal 2.1% in 2011. South America and Asia (excluding Japan) witnessed growth of 4.7% and 11.1%, respectively. Growth in Asia was led by strong contributions from China.Weak Manufacturing Hurting Production
"
669,DWDP,"U.S. chemical output barely rose on a monthly basis in October, according to the latest monthly report from the American Chemistry Council (ACC). The Washington-based chemical industry trade group reported that the U.S. Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI) edged up 0.2% in October, following an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in September. The tepid growth reflects the continued weakness in the overall manufacturing sector.
"
670,DWDP,"The U.S. CPRI, which was created by Moore Economics to track chemical production in seven regions nationwide, is comparable to Federal Reserve’s industrial production index for chemicals. The ACC noted that chemical production improved across all regions other than West Coast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on a monthly comparison basis in October.
"
671,DWDP,"The October reading showed that overall chemical production fell 0.2% when compared on a year-over-year basis. On a region-by-region basis, production rose across the Gulf Coast and Ohio Valley areas while the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Northeast and West Coast regions saw declines. On a year-to-date basis (production for the first nine months of 2012 compared with the year-ago data), production inched up 0.1%.
"
672,DWDP,"On a monthly comparison basis, chemical production in the Gulf Coast region, where key building block materials are produced, edged up 0.5% in October. The Midwest and Ohio Valley regions witnessed a 0.1% and 0.6% increase, respectively. Output slipped in the Mid-Atlantic (down 0.1%), Northeast (0.1%) and West Coast (0.2%) regions. Production crept up 1% in the Southeast.
"
673,DWDP,"Output from the U.S. manufacturing sector dipped 0.5% in October after declining 0.2% a month ago. Within this sector, output rose in several key chemistry end-user markets including appliances, aerospace and structural panels.

674,DWDP,"The manufacturing sector serves as a barometer to gauge the overall health of the U.S. economy and has a major influence on the chemical industry. Lower investment, given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff, led to the weakness in manufacturing. The U.S. market is gripped by the fear that the economy may slip back into recession should the Congress fail to avoid the roughly $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled to take effect in January 2013.
"
675,DWDP,"The ACC said that output rose across many segments such as organic chemicals, plastic resins, consumer products, coatings, adhesives, and other specialty chemicals. This was, however, masked by declines in pesticides, fertilizers, man-made fibers, synthetic rubber industrial gases and pharmaceuticals.
"
676,DWDP,"Chemical output continues its declining trend in Europe. According to the European Chemical Industry Council (“CEFIC”), chemicals production in the European Union fell 2.2% year over year in the first eight months of 2012. Production fell 2.2% year over year in August 2012. Chemicals prices rose 1% year over year in August, led by an increase in the price for basic inorganics.Raw Material Trends
"
677,DWDP,"The chemical industry uses oil, naphtha and natural gas as energy and feedstock inputs. Oil prices remain high despite the sub-par growth outlook for the global economy, largely owing to geostrategic reasons. BASF report states that the price of Brent crude oil rose sharply in 2011 (averaging $110 a barrel), stirred by the combined impact of strong demand and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.
"
678,DWDP,"Brent crude, which hit a four-year high of $128 a barrel in March 2012, is hovering between a high of $115 and a low of $105 since October 2012. Geopolitical tension in the Middle East, exacerbated by Iran's nuclear program and the unrest in Egypt, is keeping price from sliding given the concerns about a potential supply crunch.
"
679,DWDP,"Price of the other key raw material, naphtha, averaged $930 per metric ton in 2011, representing more than 30% year-over-year surge. Naphtha prices are also expected to remain elevated relative to last year’s levels. The only bright spot for the industry on the feedstock front is natural gas. In fact, the price of natural gas has dropped to its lowest level in over a decade.
"
680,DWDP,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy, shale gas, which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big energy-intensive cities. Shale gas is not only desirable for environmental reasons, given its low carbon footprint relative to oil or coal, but is at the same time cost effective.Weak View for 2012, Better Days Ahead
"
681,DWDP,"The European debt crisis, weak U.S. manufacturing along with sluggish activity in China and other key emerging markets led to weak demand for chemical products in the September quarter, something which is expected to continue through 2012. While the U.S. is not headed toward another recession, the debt issue in Europe coupled with other economic uncertainty poses downside risks to the nation’s economic outlook.
"
682,DWDP,"The ACC foresees modest production growth in 2012 followed by a stronger recovery in 2013. National chemical output is expected to slow to 0.5% in 2012 from 3.8% a year ago, and then rise to 2.3% in 2013.
"
683,DWDP,"The ACC expects weaker growth in European chemicals output in 2012, in part, due to increased uncertainty. While developed economies, restrained by debt and stricter fiscal policies, are likely to increase chemical production at a modest pace, more rapid growth in output from the emerging markets is expected in 2012.
"
684,DWDP,"The ACC sees global chemical industry output to grow 2.3% in 2012, 4.3% in 2013 and 4.7% in 2014. Stronger growth is expected in specialty chemicals, consumer products and agricultural chemicals in 2012.
"
685,DWDP,"Growth in China is expected to be healthy, albeit at a slower pace, while production in other emerging markets is expected to expand in 2012. Chemical makers in the emerging economies are expected to deliver a 6.2% production increase in 2012 followed by a 7.5% growth in 2013.
"
686,DWDP,"The ACC expects strong growth in capital spending in the coming years, stemming from new investments in petrochemicals and derivatives. It envisions capital spending to reach $35.5 billion in 2012 and steadily advance to $51.5 billion in 2017. A rebound across emerging markets is expected to contribute to accelerated growth over the next several years.
"
687,DWDP,"A recent CEFIC report says that European chemical output will contract 2% year over year this year followed by a modest increase (of 0.5%) in 2013. The economic downturn in Europe and the region’s weak construction and automotive sector will contribute to lower output in 2012.
"
688,DWDP,"Moreover, chemical production in the European Union is expected be 8% below its pre-recession level in 2012, as austerity measures adopted to staunch the high sovereign debt levels have led to higher unemployment levels and weak demand. The expectation for a slim recovery in 2013 stems from the anticipated modest growth in every quarter, partly driven by export markets.OPPORTUNITIES
"
689,DWDP,"According to the ACC, emerging market growth and abundant shale gas should help drive U.S. chemical exports. A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and strong demand from the emerging markets. Affordable natural gas and ethane (derived from shale gas) offer U.S. producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive, oil-based feedstock.
"
690,DWDP,"Further, cost-cutting measures implemented by chemical companies including plant closures and headcount reduction, should yield industry-wide margin improvements. Cash flows derived through these actions can be used for growth.
"
691,DWDP,"Mergers and acquisitions offer chemical companies another means to shore up growth in this difficult scenario. These companies remain focused on exploring growth opportunities in the fast-growing emerging markets, particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America such as China and Brazil.
"
692,DWDP,"We feel that chemical companies with strong earnings quality, healthy growth trajectory and liquidity profiles are better placed in the current rickety market environment considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value in form of dividends and share repurchases or use them for value acquisitions.
"
693,DWDP,"We have a bullish view on Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), which is delivering forecast-topping earnings and is well placed to benefit from its Solutia acquisition. The company’s diversified chemical portfolio and integrated and diverse downstream businesses represents the pillars of strength. It also benefits from business restructuring, cost-cutting measures and increased capacity additions.
"
694,DWDP,"We are also optimistic about Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) despite the challenges it faces in Europe. We like the company’s initiatives to improve margins and profits by running its plants better and controlling expenses. The company’s strong presence in emerging markets, especially in China, will enable it to deliver incremental earnings in 2012. We are also upbeat about the prospect of its TCX ethanol process technology.
"
695,DWDP,"In specialty chemical space, PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) represents an attractive play. The company witnessed strong growth in its North American automotive OEM coatings business in the September quarter, enabling it to deliver better-than-expected earnings. It has a diversified base of products and markets, and looks to grow its businesses strategically along with controlling costs.
"
696,DWDP,"We also hold a favorable view on specialty chemical company Methanex Corp. (MEOH  -  Free Report). The company has taken up a number of steps, including production ramp ups in New Zealand and the Medicine Hat unit, to boost capacity. We are upbeat about its Louisiana project, which is expected to create significant value for its shareholders and meaningfully contribute in cash generation.WEAKNESSES
"
697,DWDP,"Commodity price hikes, though subsiding lately, is adding to feedstock costs for many of the U.S. chemical producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures at play. As a result, margins for a number of producers will continue to be under pressure.
"
698,DWDP,"Given the industry’s sensitivity to the global economy, any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical companies. The turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty. Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand (particularly in the construction industry) and the lingering impact of debt crisis.
"
699,DWDP,"The U.S. housing sector, a key consumer of chemicals, has shown signs of recovery lately, manifested by a steady pick-up in home prices. However, demand from this industry still remains way below the historic levels. Weakness in the electronics and construction end-markets may continue to weigh on the results.
"
700,DWDP,"Chemical companies generate a considerable amount of revenues outside the U.S., and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. Unfavorable currency exchange translation (stemming from a stronger dollar) dented most of these companies’ results in the most recent quarter.
"
701,DWDP,"Another challenge comes in the form of production disruptions as a result of Hurricane Sandy, which wreaked havoc on the Northeast U.S. Production is expected to be hit by associated outages in the December quarter.
"
702,DWDP,"Chemical titan The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) was hammered by several headwinds in the September quarter. Its profit slid on lower pricing across all regions. The company also saw weak demand for its products in the quarter, stemming from the challenging conditions in Europe and sluggish activity across major emerging markets.  
"
703,DWDP,"Moreover, building and construction sales remain under pressure due to lower volume in Europe and recovery in electronics remains slow, partly due to sluggish growth China. Moreover, currency headwinds are expected to continue given the weak euro. The company announced a major restructuring program including headcount reductions, plant closures and capital spending cuts.
"
704,DWDP,"The other chemical giant DuPont (DD) had a drab third quarter due to lower demand across titanium dioxide and photovoltaic markets. It witnessed weakness across a number of end markets in the quarter. The company reduced its earnings forecast for 2012 and announced a restructuring plan that includes retrenchment of 1,500 workers globally.
"
705,DWDP,"DuPont also remains exposed to raw material cost inflation, which is expected to constrict its margin in the fourth quarter. Moreover, currency headwinds weighed on the performance of a number of segments in the third quarter and are expected to reduce its earnings for 2012.Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) also felt the heat in the September quarter as weak demand due to the sluggish economic conditions led to a big slide in its profit. Slowing U.S. manufacturing growth due to high unemployment and the concerns over the U.S. fiscal cliff coupled with the slowdown in Asia is expected to impinge its results moving ahead. We have downgraded our rating on the stock to Underperform factoring in the challenges it may face in the next fiscal year.
"
706,DWDP,"Agricultural chemical company Agrium Inc. (AGU) has put up a lackluster third quarter on weak potash demand and is expected see a weak December quarter due to a significant decline in international potash demand and lower ammonia sales volume in Western Canada. Moreover, global phosphate market is expected to remain weak in the near term, partly due to lower demand from India.
"
707,DWDP,"Specialty chemical company Valspar Corporation (VAL) is contending with the difficult global economic conditions. Persistent weakness in its Paints segment hurt its sales in the most recent quarter. The segment has been hit by a weak residential housing market in Australia, which may continue to affect revenues moving ahead.
"
708,DWDP,"June quarter results mostly reflect a slow economic recovery in the U.S. and persistent recessionary conditions in Europe, leading to weakening demand for chemical products. High input costs and weaknesses across some key end-markets (such as construction and electronics) remain the major impediments to growth.
"
709,DWDP,"Companies in the chemicals space witnessed slowing economic activity in the quarter, largely due to the fragile economic conditions in Europe. Outlook for the U.S. economy has also suffered, though more recent data points seem to indicate some improvement.
"
710,DWDP,"Even the emerging markets have not been immune from global downturn. Activity in China and some other emerging economies slowed in the June quarter. The Chinese economy has been going through a rough patch as government stimulus actions have not been successful failed to staunch the slowdown, at least for now. The problems were compounded by a slowdown in exports. These issues are expected to continue to weigh on the performance of the chemical stocks in the second half of 2012.Industry Dynamics
"
711,DWDP,"Chemicals are generally used to make a number of consumer goods and are also used in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service industries. In fact, the chemical industry itself consumes 26% of its own output. Major industrial consumers include rubber and plastic, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp and paper and primary metals.
"
712,DWDP,"The chemical industry, a nearly $3 trillion global business, has grown at a brisk pace for more than five decades. The fastest growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic organic polymers used as plastics, fibers and elastomers. The chemical industry is mainly concentrated in three areas of the world: Western Europe, North America and Japan. Europe is the largest producer, followed by the U.S. and Japan.
"
713,DWDP,"The U.S. chemical industry represents roughly 19% of the global chemical output and employs more than 800,000 people. It is responsible for 10% of the nation’s merchandise exports, aggregating $145 billion annually. Roughly 5.5 million additional jobs are backed by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry.
"
714,DWDP,"The chemical industry, by nature, is cyclical and heavily linked to the overall condition of the U.S. economy. Chemical industry also touches 90% of manufactured goods, making the manufacturing industry the biggest consumer of chemical products.
"
715,DWDP,"There are 170 major chemical companies in the U.S. operating internationally with more than 2,800 facilities abroad. The chemical industry is among the biggest industries in the U.S., a roughly $760 billion enterprise. It has been consistently leading the U.S. economy’s business cycle due to its early position in the supply chain.
"
716,DWDP,"According to chemical giant BASF SE (BASFY), global chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) rose 4.8% in 2011, backed by healthy demand from major industries. In the EU, chemical production edged up 1.6% while declining 3.1% in Japan, hurt by the March 2011 quake.
"
717,DWDP,"The sluggish economy took a toll on growth in the U.S. as the nation’s chemical production grew a nominal 2.1% in 2011. South America and Asia (excluding Japan) witnessed growth of 4.7% and 11.1%, respectively. Growth in Asia was led by strong contributions from China.End-Market Scenario
"
718,DWDP,"U.S. chemical production continues its monthly declining streak as reflected in the recently released data by the American Chemistry Council (“ACC”). The Washington-based chemical industry trade group said that the Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI) fell 0.1% in June, following a downwardly revised 0.5% decline in May.
"
719,DWDP,"The U.S. CPRI, which was created by Moore Economics to track chemical production in seven regions across the nation, is comparable to Federal Reserve’s industrial production index for chemicals. The ACC reported that chemical production dipped in the Gulf Coast, Midwest, Southeast and West Coast regions and was flat in the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions.
"
720,DWDP,"On a region-by-region basis, production declined across all regions except the Gulf Coast and Ohio Valley areas. On a year-to-date basis (production for the first six months of 2012 compared with the year-ago data), production nudged up 0.2%.
"
721,DWDP,"On a monthly comparison basis, chemical production in the Gulf Coast region, where key building block materials are produced, was down 0.4% in June. The Midwest region saw a decline of 0.2%. Productions in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic regions were flat in June. Production slipped in the Southeast (down 0.2%) and West Coast (0.1%) regions during the month while remained unchanged in the Northeast.
"
722,DWDP,"Output from the U.S. manufacturing sector, the largest consumer of chemical products, crept up 0.2% in June, following a 0.1% fall a month ago. Within this sector, output rose in several key chemistry end-user markets including appliances, motor vehicles, computers, apparel, structural panels, rubber products, paper and printing.
"
723,DWDP,"Demand for U.S. manufacturing has been weak in recent months given the ongoing European predicament and slowdown in Chinese manufacturing sector. The ACC noted that output clipped in a number of key segments including plastic resins, fertilizers, adhesives, organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, production rose across many segments such as inorganic chemicals, industrial gases, consumer products, pesticides, coatings and synthetic rubber.
"
724,DWDP,"The decline in chemical output was also witnessed in Europe . According to the European Chemical Industry Council (“ECIC”), chemicals production in the European Union fell 2.1% year over year in the first five months of 2012. Production edged down 0.7% year over year in May 2012. Chemicals prices rose 2.7% year over year in May, led by a 4% increase in the price for basic inorganics.Raw Material Trends
"
725,DWDP,"The chemical industry uses oil, naphtha and natural gas as energy and feedstock inputs. Oil prices remain high despite the sub-par growth outlook for the global economy, largely owing to geostrategic reasons. BASF report states that the price of Brent crude oil rose sharply in 2011 (averaging $110 a barrel), stirred by the combined impact of strong demand and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.
"
726,DWDP,"Brent crude, which hit a four-year high of $128 a barrel in March 2012, recently exceeded $116 (highest in more than three months) on supply concerns stemming from Iran’s controversial nuclear program and a sharp decline in U.S. crude oil inventories.
"
727,DWDP,"Price of the other key raw material, naphtha, averaged at $930 per metric ton in 2011, representing more than 30% year-over-year surge. Naphtha prices are also expected to remain elevated relative to last year’s levels. The only bright spot for the industry on the feedstock front is natural gas. In fact, the price of natural gas has dropped to its lowest level in over a decade.
"
728,DWDP,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy, shale gas, which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big energy-intensive cities. Shale gas is not only desirable for environmental reasons, given its low carbon footprint relative to oil or coal, but is at the same time cost effective.2012: A Balanced View
"
729,DWDP,"For the rest of 2012, the outlook for the global chemical industry is balanced, as the U.S. and European Union continue to contend with soft local economies while the emerging markets are expected to show higher growth in output despite the recent slowdown.
"
730,DWDP,"The ACC foresees moderate production growth this year followed by a stronger recovery in 2013. National chemical output is expected to slow to 1.6% in 2012 from 3.8% a year ago, and then rise to 2.1% in 2013. A rebound across most of the key end-use markets is helping to maintain the industry's contribution to the nation’s economic growth.
"
731,DWDP,"The chemicals outlook indicates moderate growth over the next few years, depending on certain factors including strengthening domestic demand and an improvement in overseas exports. Exports climbed nearly 11% to $189 billion last year and are projected to surpass $230 billion in 2014.
"
732,DWDP,"While the U.S. economy is not headed toward another recession, the sovereign debt plight in Europe coupled with other economic factors poses downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook.
"
733,DWDP,"The ACC projects weaker growth in the European chemicals output than its earlier forecast in 2012, in part, due to increased uncertainty. Most of last year’s output growth took place in the first quarter after a strong demand recovery with double-digit growth witnessed in 2010.
"
734,DWDP,"The ECIC, however, sees growth resuming in 2012, strengthening steadily through the year. The group forecasts 1.5% chemical industry growth this year. While developed economies, restrained by debt and stricter fiscal policies, are likely to increase chemical production at a modest pace, more rapid growth in output from the emerging markets is expected in 2012.
"
735,DWDP,"Asia and other emerging markets are expected to continue to lead in volume increases. Chemical makers in the emerging markets are expected to deliver a 6.2% production increase in 2012 followed by 7.5% in 2013.OPPORTUNITIES
"
736,DWDP,"According to the ACC, emerging market growth and abundant shale gas should help drive U.S. chemical exports. A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and strong demand from the emerging markets. Affordable natural gas and ethane (derived from shale gas) offer U.S. producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive, oil-based feedstock.
"
737,DWDP,"Further, cost-cutting measures implemented by chemical companies, such as plant closures, aggressive cost containment and production improvement initiatives, should yield industry-wide margin improvements. Cash flows derived through these actions can be used for growth.
"
738,DWDP,"Mergers and acquisitions offer chemical companies another means to shore up growth in this difficult scenario. These companies remain focused on exploring growth opportunities in the fast-growing emerging markets, particularly in the lucrative regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America such as China and Brazil.
"
739,DWDP,"We feel that chemical companies with strong earnings quality, healthy growth trajectory and liquidity profiles are better placed in the current rickety market environment considering their ability to leverage strong balance sheet and cash flows in maximizing shareholder value in form of dividends and share repurchases or use them for value acquisitions.
"
740,DWDP,"Some of the key end-markets for chemical products are on an uptrend. This has been evident from the recent earnings reports of leading chemical players. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. (DD), for example, put up a healthy performance in the recently reported quarter. The company saw strong performance in agriculture, food and bioscience businesses, along with its advanced materials business, which witnessed healthy results despite weak European markets. The Danisco acquisition contributed to higher sales in the quarter.Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) is well placed to benefit from its acquisition of Solutia. The company’s diversified chemical portfolio, along with its integrated and diverse downstream businesses, is driving earnings. The company benefits from business restructuring, cost-cutting measures and increased capacity additions.
"
741,DWDP,"We also hold a favorable view on Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) despite the challenges it faces in Europe. We like the company’s initiatives to improve margins and profits by running its plants better and controlling expenses, which should yield results through the rest of 2012. The company’s strong presence in emerging markets, especially in China, will enable it to deliver incremental earnings in 2012. We are also upbeat about the prospect of its TCX ethanol process technology.
"
742,DWDP,"In agricultural chemical space, we like the prospects of Agrium Inc. (AGU). Fertilizer stocks like Agrium stands to gain from the U.S. Midwest drought in the remainder of 2012. The company has logged a solid second quarter and is poised to benefit from skyrocketing crop prices and overall strong fundamentals for the agriculture and crop input market. High crop prices (especially for corn) and tight grain inventories are expected to create huge demand for its nutrients.WEAKNESSES
"
743,DWDP,"The global nature of the industry puts competitive issues into sharp focus. The U.S. producers have responded to competitive pressures by streamlining operations, relocating manufacturing facilities to low-cost regions closer to end-markets, and being overall more nimble and flexible in responding to market opportunities. And it is not always easy to pull this off.
"
744,DWDP,"Commodity price hikes, though subsiding lately, is adding to feedstock costs for many of these producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures at play. As a result, margins for a number of producers will continue to be under pressure.
"
745,DWDP,"Given the industry’s sensitivity to the global economy, any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical companies. The turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty. Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand (particularly in the construction industry) and the lingering impact of debt crisis.
"
746,DWDP,"Moreover, the U.S. housing sector remains a weak end-market. The domestic housing sector, a key consumer of chemicals, is likely to remain soft through the remainder of 2012. Weakness in the electronics and construction end-markets may weigh on the results in the back half of the year.
"
747,DWDP,"Chemical companies generate a considerable amount of revenues outside the U.S., and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations. Unfavorable currency exchange translation (stemming from a stronger dollar) dented most of these companies’ results in the most recent quarter.
"
748,DWDP,"Chemical titan The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) was pummeled by several headwinds in the June quarter. The company’s results were hurt by the beleaguered economic conditions in Europe. Softness across electronics and construction markets may continue to impinge its results in the second half. Moreover, Dow is facing challenges in Western Europe due to the recessionary conditions and expects currency headwinds to continue given the weak euro.Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) also felt the heat in the June quarter as it faced challenging conditions in Europe and Asia and unfavorable currency exchange impact. The company has reduced its adjusted earnings per share target for fiscal 2012 factoring in the currency headwinds and slower economic growth.
"
749,DWDP,"In specialty chemical space, PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) is expected to face greater challenges going ahead. While the company had a decent second quarter recently, it expects the European market to remain under pressure and foresees inconsistent growth in North America and Asia. Moreover, the company expects higher input costs to continue to weigh on its results in the second half. Currency exchange also remains a sore point.
"
750,DWDP,"Also in specialty chemical, Methanex Corp. (MEOH  -  Free Report) posted lower-than-expected results in the second quarter. The company’s production was hit by curtailment in natural gas supplies and eventually constrained revenues. Methanex remains exposed to tight economic conditions and uncertainties associated with the demand and pricing of methanol. We have downgraded our rating on the stock to Underpeform factoring in these issues.
"
751,DWDP,"Another specialty chemical company Valspar Corporation (VAL) is contending with the difficult global economic conditions. Unfavorable currency exchange swings hurt the company’s sales in the most recent quarter. The uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, slow recovery in the U.S. and decelerating growth in China is expected to continue to impact its results moving ahead.
"
752,DWDP,"The market will likely bask some more in the after-glow of Friday’s positive job report as it has nothing else to latch onto given the almost empty economic calendar and the winding down of second quarter earnings season. There is some optimism on the European front as well, with initial disappointment over Mario Draghi’s plan from last week giving way to hopes that something may be afoot after all.
"
753,DWDP,"That said, we have reached the dog days of summer when news flow and trading volumes get thinner. Maybe we should all just focus on the Olympics for the next few days instead of the market. But with Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt already done with their events and the LeBron James squad magnitudes better than their competitors, the rest of the London spectacle may not be that engaging either.
"
754,DWDP,"Notwithstanding continued German opposition to bond purchases from the ECB, the market appears to be seeing some glimmers of hope in the Draghi plan after all. This reassessment follows reaction from the Spanish government that seemed to indicate that it may be not be averse to jump through the hoops in order to enable the ECB to purchase its bonds. The modest downtrend in Spanish bond yields is a reflection of this hope.
"
755,DWDP,"We are entering the final phase of the second-quarter earnings season this week, with results from 410 of the S&P 500 companies (or roughly 82% of the total) already known. We will be closer to the finish line by the end of this week as we will have results from 91% of the companies by then.
"
756,DWDP,"Total earnings are up 5.1% from the same period last year, primarily due to easy comparisons for the large banks. This compares to 8.3% growth for these same companies in the first quarter, when banks didn’t have such easy comparisons. Excluding Finance, total earnings growth falls into negative territory, down 1.3% from the same period last year, compared to positive 6.5% growth for the ex-Finance group in the first quarter.
"
757,DWDP,"The most notable aspect of this reporting season has been the top-line weakness, with only 38% of the companies coming out with positive revenue surprises. Even a number of these companies with positive surprises for the second quarter have guided towards softer revenue numbers in the coming quarters.
"
758,DWDP,"Other notable features of this reporting season were change of leadership from Tech to Finance, negative comparisons in the Energy sector and the weaker-than-expected results in Basic Materials as high profile misses from Dow Chemicals (DOW) and International Paper (IP  -  Free Report) show. The drought and its impact on grain prices is starting to show up in results as well, as this morning’s Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) report shows.RELATED ARTICLESQ2 Earnings: Revenue Weakness Stands OutHave We Seen the Lows for the Year?Will Britain Win Economic Gold Thanks to the Olympics?
"
759,DWDP,"Although March quarter results show continued signs of improvement in the U.S., a soft operating environment in Europe continues to weigh on the companies in the chemicals space. High input costs, weaknesses across some key end-markets (such as construction and electronics) and the European sovereign debt crisis remain the major impediments to growth.
"
760,DWDP,"While the U.S. economy has still not reached a robust growth phase and Western Europe remains crippled with debt issues, the chemical industry is well placed to reap the benefits of the emerging market tailwind in 2012, with Asia holding the magic wand for growth.Industry Dynamics

"
763,DWDP,"The U.S. chemical industry represents roughly 19% of the global chemicals output and employs more than 800,000 people. It is responsible for 10% of the nation’s merchandise exports, aggregating $145 billion annually. Roughly 5.5 million additional jobs are backed by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry. The chemical industry, by nature, is cyclical and heavily linked to the overall condition of the U.S. economy.
"
764,DWDP,"According to chemical giant BASF SE (BASFY  -  Free Report), global chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) rose 4.8% in 2011, backed by healthy demand from major industries. In the EU, chemical production edged up 1.6% while declining 3.1% in Japan, hurt by the March 2011 quake.
"
765,DWDP,"The sluggish economy took a toll on growth in the U.S. as the nation’s chemical production grew a nominal 2.1% in 2011. South America and Asia (excluding Japan) witnessed growth of 4.7% and 11.1%, respectively. Growth in Asia was led by strong contributions from China.End-Market Scenario
"
766,DWDP,"There are 170 major chemical companies in the U.S. operating internationally with more than 2,800 facilities abroad. The chemical industry is among the biggest industries in the U.S., a roughly $720 billion enterprise, accounting for 26% of the nation’s GDP.
"
767,DWDP,"According to the American Chemistry Council (“ACC”), the Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI), crept up 0.1% in March 2012, following a revised 1% gain in February. Results were mixed in different regions, with gains clocked across the Gulf Coast, Midwest, Ohio Valley and Southeast regions while production dipped in Mid-Atlantic and West Coast and was flat in the Northeast.
"
768,DWDP,"Output from the U.S. manufacturing sector, the largest consumer of chemical products, nudged up 0.6% in March 2012, following a 1.1% gain a month ago. Output in several key chemistry end-use markets rose, including structural panels, plastic products, computers, motor vehicles, aerospace, machinery and construction supplies.
"
769,DWDP,"Compared to March 2011, total chemical production across the board rose 1.3% and was ahead in all regions. The year-over-year comparisons improved in several regions, including the Gulf Coast, Ohio Valley and the Southeast.Raw Material Market Trends
"
770,DWDP,"The chemical industry uses oil, naphtha and natural gas as energy and feedstock inputs. Oil prices remain high despite the sub-par growth outlook for the global economy, largely owing to geostrategic reasons. BASF report states that the price of Brent crude oil rose sharply in 2011 (averaging at $110 a barrel), stirred by the combined impact of strong demand and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa.
"
771,DWDP,"Price of the other key raw material, naphtha, averaged at $930 per metric ton in 2011, a more than 30% year-over-year surge. Naphtha prices are also expected to remain elevated relative to last year’s levels. The only bright spot for the industry on the feedstock front is natural gas. In fact, the price of natural gas has dropped to its lowest level in over a decade.
"
772,DWDP,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy, shale gas, which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big energy-intensive cities. Shale gas is not only desirable for environmental reasons, given its low carbon footprint relative to oil or coal, but is at the same time cost effective.2012: Emerging Markets Hold the Key
"
773,DWDP,"For 2012, the outlook for the global chemical industry is balanced, as the U.S. and European Union continue to contend with soft local economies and debt constraints, while the emerging markets are expected to show more rapid growth in output.
"
774,DWDP,"The ACC foresees moderate production growth this year followed by a stronger recovery in 2013. National chemical output is expected to slow to 1.6% in 2012 from 3.8% a year ago, and then rise to 2.1% in 2013. A rebound across most of the key end-use markets is helping to maintain the industry's contribution to the nation’s economic growth.
"
775,DWDP,"The chemicals outlook indicates moderate growth over the next few years, depending on certain factors including strengthening domestic demand and an improvement in overseas exports. Exports climbed nearly 11% to $189 billion last year and are projected to surpass $230 billion in 2014.
"
776,DWDP,"While the U.S. economy is not headed towards another recession, the sovereign debt plight in Europe coupled with other economic factors poses downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook.
"
777,DWDP,"The ACC projects weaker growth in the European chemicals output than its earlier forecast in 2012, in part, due to increased uncertainty. Most of last year’s output growth took place in the first quarter after a strong demand recovery with double-digit growth witnessed in 2010.
"
778,DWDP,"The European Chemical Industry Council (“ECIC”), however, sees growth resuming in 2012, strengthening steadily through the year. The group forecasts 1.5% chemical industry growth this year.
"
779,DWDP,"While developed economies, restrained by debt and stricter fiscal policies, are likely to increase chemical production at a modest pace, a more rapid growth in output from the emerging markets is expected in 2012.
"
780,DWDP,"Asia and other emerging markets are expected to continue to lead in volume increases with the most significant gains coming from China and India. The ACC also envision China to overtake the U.S. as the largest market for chemicals. Chemical makers in the emerging markets are expected to deliver a 6.2% production increase in 2012 followed by 7.5% in 2013.OPPORTUNITIES
"
781,DWDP,"The ACC notes that emerging market growth, abundant shale gas and a still supportive dollar exchange rate should help drive U.S. chemical exports.
"
782,DWDP,"A string of factors are driving growth in the export markets including favorable energy costs stemming from the abundance of shale gas and strong demand from the emerging markets. Affordable natural gas and ethane (derived from shale gas) offer U.S. producers a compelling cost advantage over their global counterparts who use a more expensive, oil-based feedstock.
"
783,DWDP,"Further, cost-cutting measures implemented by chemical companies, such as plant closures, aggressive cost containment and production improvement initiatives, should yield industry-wide margin improvements. Cash flows derived through these actions can be used for growth.
"
784,DWDP,"Mergers and acquisitions offer chemical companies another means to shore up growth in this difficult scenario. These companies remain focused on exploring growth opportunities in the fast-growing emerging markets, particularly the lucrative regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America such as China and Brazil.
"
785,DWDP,"A major deal in this space was last year’s acquisition of Danisco by EI DuPont de Nemours & Co (DD) for $6.3 billion. The acquisition strengthened the company’s presence in the food ingredient and enzyme markets, and expanded its presence in industrial biotechnology and biofuels.
"
786,DWDP,"The deal synced well with DuPont’s strategy to expand beyond its chemical and manufacturing focus into the “megatrend” sectors of agribusiness and alternative energy. Both industries are expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as food demand and prices increase and clean energy policies gain more ground.
"
787,DWDP,"Some of the key end-markets for chemical products are on an uptrend. This has been manifested by the recent earnings reports of leading chemical players. DuPont, for example, logged a double-digit surge in sales riding on higher sales volume in the Agriculture segment. Danisco contributed to higher profit in the quarter.
"
788,DWDP,"Despite softness in the consumer electronics segment, the company is poised for growth on the heels of strong momentum in agriculture and food businesses. On the cost-saving front, DuPont remains on track to achieve its fixed cost productivity targets of $1 billion by 2012.
"
789,DWDP,"The other chemical titan, The Dow Chemical Company (DOW), is delivering cost synergies from the Rohm & Haas acquisition and is targeting synergy capture of $2 billion by the end of 2012. Dow is also benefiting from strong fundamentals in agriculture and food markets. It believes economic recovery will gain momentum in the second quarter and through the remainder of 2012.
"
790,DWDP,"Moreover, Dow sees an improving U.S. economy citing tailwind from the nation’s rich access to low-cost natural gas. Despite challenges in Europe faced by both DuPont and Dow, we are optimistic about the long-term prospects of these two industry behemoths.Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report) is expected to benefit from the acquisition of Solutia (expected to close in mid-2012). Higher selling prices contributed to revenue growth in the March quarter. The company’s diversified chemical portfolio, along with its integrated and diverse downstream businesses, is driving earnings. The company benefits from business restructuring and cost-cutting measures as well as increased capacity additions.
"
791,DWDP,"We also hold a favorable view on Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) despite the challenges it faces in Europe. The company’s profit shot up 29% in the March quarter on higher volumes and pricing in its acetyl intermediates and industrial specialties businesses. We like the company’s initiatives to improve margins and profits by running its plants better and controlling expenses, which should yield results through the rest of 2012.                                                                                         WEAKNESSES
"
792,DWDP,"The global nature of the industry puts competitive issues into sharp focus. The U.S. producers have responded to competitive pressures by streamlining operations, relocating manufacturing facilities to low-cost regions closer to end-markets, and being overall more nimble and flexible in responding to market opportunities. And it is not always easy to pull this off.
"
793,DWDP,"Commodity price hikes, though subsiding lately, is adding to feedstock costs for many of these producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given the competitive pressures at play. As a result, margins for a number of producers will continue to be under pressure.
"
794,DWDP,"Given the industry’s sensitivity to the global economy, any negative current in the macro economy would be reflected in the prospects of the chemical companies. The turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty. Western Europe continues to pose challenges on chemical stocks due to weak demand (particularly in the construction industry) and the lingering impact of debt crisis.
"
795,DWDP,"Moreover, the U.S. housing sector remains a weak end-market. The domestic housing sector, a key consumer of chemicals, is likely to remain soft through 2012. Weakness in the electronics and construction end-markets may weigh on the June quarter results.
"
796,DWDP,"Chemical makers are also exposed to several regulatory hurdles and compliance issues. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, has proposed a new mandate which could enforce more stringent hazardous air pollutant emissions limitation on boiler operators. Based on EPA’s estimate, compliance with these rules would cost these operators billions of dollars annually, even leading to mill closures.
"
797,DWDP,"The largest manufacturers operating on a global scale with plants in numerous countries include the likes of BASF, Braskem S.A. (BAK  -  Free Report), Celanese, Degussa, Dow Chemical, DuPont, Eastman Chemical, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report), Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MTU) and PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report).
"
798,DWDP,"This morning’s earnings reports are not too bad if we realize that not every company can do what Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) did the other day. That said, we do have a few uninspiring reports this morning from bellwether operators like Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) that puts Apple’s outperformance in its appropriate context. While we can’t say that this morning’s earnings reports are altogether disappointing, there is no other way of describing Jobless Claims reading.  
"
799,DWDP,"The Jobless Claims data fails to satisfy the doubts raised by the recent run of underwhelming labor market reports, starting with the surprise March payroll miss. The official report says that Initial Jobless Claims dropped by 1000 to 388K, but in reality it is a 2000 increase, as the preceding week’s tally was revised higher by 3000. The four-week average, which tends to smooth out the inherent week-to-week jumpiness of this series, increased by 6.2K to 381.8K last week.
"
800,DWDP,"It is unclear at this stage whether the emerging softness in labor market over the last few weeks is a reflection of economic improvement stalling or just due to complications in seasonally adjusting this data.
"
801,DWDP,"Bernanke has his own theory on the recent run of soft labor readings, which he explained again in his press conference Wednesday afternoon. He thinks that the pre-March strength may have been caused by a temporary catch-up in hiring to compensate for the over-reaction of employers during the downturn.
"
802,DWDP,"But irrespective of whether seasonal factors or something more fundamental is behind the recent run of weak labor market readings, it is raising doubts about the sustainability of the recovery. We will get a better read on the labor market in a week from Friday when we get the April non-farm payroll numbers.
"
803,DWDP,"We have a huge day on the earnings front today, with more than 60 companies from the S&P 500 coming out with results. Of the more noteworthy results this morning, we got earnings misses from Exxon and UPS, though Pepsi (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dow Chemical (DOW) came ahead of earnings expectations. Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) will report after the close today.RELATED ARTICLESJobless Claims Fall Less Than Expected to 388,000FED Stands PatDurable Goods Down, Earnings Up
"
804,DWDP,"Earnings Preview 1/27/12
"
805,DWDP,"Earnings season will be in full swing this week 468 firms scheduled to report, and 99 of those will be members of the S&P 500.  By the end of the week we should have a very good handle on just how weak or strong this earnings season will be.
"
806,DWDP,"The firms reporting next week read like a who’s who of American Industry.  They include: Aflac (AFL  -  Free Report), Allstate  (ALL  -  Free Report), Clorox (CLX  -  Free Report), Dow Chemical (DOW), International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), United Parcel Service (UPS), and Exxon Mobil (XOM).
"
807,DWDP,"It will also be an extremely busy week on the economic data front.  We start with Personal Income and Spending, and the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the core PCE index, Tuesday brings the Case-Schiller housing price index and Consumer Confidence.  Wednesday has the ISM manufacturing data, Auto Sales, and the ADP employment numbers, Thursday brings Productivity and Unit Labor costs.  All of that is a prologue to the really big numbers of the week: the Employment Report for January.  The market is going to have lots to chew on.Monday
"
808,DWDP,"Personal Income is expected to rise by 0.4% in December, up from a 0.1% gain in November.  The composition of Personal Income can be as important as the total.  Last month’s Personal Income growth was even weaker than the 0.1% would indicate, as income from wages and salaries fell, offset by increases in rental income and interest and dividend income.
"
809,DWDP,"Personal Spending (Personal Consumption Expenditures) are expected to have risen by 0.1% matching its November increase.  With income rising faster than spending, it will indicate an increasing Savings Rate.  Over the long term we need a higher savings rate, as it increases it slows the economy.
"
810,DWDP,"The core Personal Consumption Expenditure inflation rate, the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, is expected to edge up at a 0.2% rate, up from 0.1% in November.
"
811,DWDP," Tuesday
"
812,DWDP,"The Case-Schiller index is expected to show a year-over-year decline in home prices of 2.6% for November.  That would be a major improvement over the 3.4% year-over-year decline in October.  Since housing equity still represents the most important store of wealth for the middle class, and housing tends to be a highly leveraged asset, the direction of home prices is vital. Also, if housing prices stop falling, then fewer people will be pushed “underwater” on their mortgages.  Being underwater makes you vulnerable to foreclosure.  I think we are getting close to a bottom in housing prices, but are not quite there yet.  That does not mean that we are likely to get a strong rebound in prices, but rather a long period of bumping along the bottom.
"
813,DWDP,"The Employment Cost Index is expected to have risen by 0.4% in the fourth quarter, up from a 0.3% rise in the third quarter.  That is still a very low rate of increase.
"
814,DWDP,"The Chicago PMI, the last of the mini-ISM’s to come out is expected to edge down to 62 for January from 62.5 in December.  As a magic 50 index, any reading over 50 indicates expansion.  Thus if the consensus is right, the manufacturing economy in the Upper Midwest is still expanding at a brisk rate, but slightly slower than in December.
"
815,DWDP,"The Consumer Confidence Index is expected to increase to 67 for January, up from 64.5 in December.  While I think this is an overrated indicator since what consumers say in the surveys is often different from what they actually do, it is better to see it going up than down.  It is still at a relatively low level.Wednesday
"
816,DWDP,"The ADP Employment report is expected to show a gain of 175,000 private sector jobs in January.  In December it reported a gain of 325,000 that proved to be far too high relative to the BLS’s “official” count of 212,000 private sector jobs added.  In the past, when there has been a big disparity between the two measures, they tend to move closer to each other by the time all the revisions are in, and usually the BLS numbers get revised more.  It is still worth noting what the ADP revisions turn out to be.
"
817,DWDP,"The ISM Manufacturing index is expected to show a rise to 54.7 from 53.9 in December.  That would indicate that the manufacturing index is expanding at a solid rate, and faster than in December.  It is made up of ten sub-indexes.  Those can be as interesting and informative as the overall index.  In particular, pay close attention to the Production, Backlog, New Orders and Employment sub-indexes.
"
818,DWDP,"Construction Spending is expected to have increased by 0.4% in December, on top of a 1.2% increase in November.
"
819,DWDP,"Auto Sales in January are expected to dip to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 13.6 million from 13.6 million in December.  The December level was the highest since August 2009 (“Cash for Clunkers”).  At the bottom of the recession, sales were below a 10 million annual rate, but it is probably going to be a long time before they get back to the 17 million rate they hit before the Great Recession.Thursday
"
820,DWDP,"Weekly Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance rose by 21,000 to 377,000.  That, however, came after they fell by 52,000 the previous week, and a big jump the week before that.  The extreme volatility in recent weeks is probably due to a flawed seasonal adjustment process.  Last week’s level is probably about right.  The consensus is looking for a small decline to 375,000  These past three weeks illustrate just how volatile week-to-week numbers can be, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on (which reached 377,5000 last week).  Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.
"
821,DWDP,"Continuing Jobless Claims have been in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they rose by 88,000 to 3.554 million. That is down 465,000, or 11.6%, from a year ago. The consensus is looking for a dip to 3.525 million. Some (most?) of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 146,000 to 3.414 million last week and are down 1.205 million, or 26.0% over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits -- currently at 7.638 million. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.773 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed, all extended benefits will end at the start of March. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.
"
822,DWDP,"Productivity is expected to have increased by 0.5% in the fourth quarter, down from a 2.3% surge in the third quarter.  Over the long term, there is probably no economic measure that is more important than productivity growth, since it ultimately governs GDP per capita, or how wealthy we are as a country adjusted for the number of people we have.  However, at times of high unemployment, productivity growth can be a mixed blessing.  Making the same amount of stuff with fewer people does not put people to work.  This report will also show unit labor costs.  They tumbled 2.5% in the third quarter, as the benefits of higher productivity accrued to the owners of capital, not to those that provide labor.  They are expected to rise a still relatively low 0.6% in the fourth quarter.  Falling unit labor costs are good news for corporate profits.Friday
"
823,DWDP,"The most important economic report of the week will be the Employment report.  It is expected to show a total increase of 145,000 jobs in January, down from 200,000 in December.  Once again, the private sector is expected to account for all of the job gains and then some, with 170,000 private sector jobs added offset by 25,000 government jobs lost.  In December there were 12,000 government pink slips.  Given the relatively low level of initial jobless claims, I will take the over on this one.  Make sure to look at the revisions to previous months, which have been very positive of late.  The unemployment rate is expected to edge down to 8.5% from 8.6%.  I expect it to remain unchanged as more “discouraged” workers find their way back to the workforce, offsetting the job gains.  Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.2%, matching their December increase.  The average workweek is expected to remain steady at 34.4 hours.  There are lots of other important numbers in the report.  The duration of unemployment numbers are of particular interest given their extremely elevated level.
"
824,DWDP,"The ISM Non Manufacturing or Service index is expected to increase to 53.1 from 52.6 last month.  That would indicate that the service side of the economy is expanding at a faster pace than in December, but not doing quite as well as the manufacturing side.  As with the manufacturing index, the sub-indexes can be just as informative as the overall index.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
825,DWDP,"The best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.In the Earnings Calendar below, $999.00 should be read as N.A. Potential Positive Surprises:Ryder Systems (R) is expected to earn $0.97, up from $0.65 a year ago.  Last time out, it had a positive surprise of 6.86%, and over the last four weeks analysts have raised their estimates for the quarter by 0.40%.  R is a Zacks #1 Rank stock.Roper Industries (ROP) is expected to earn $1.21, up from $1.10 a year ago.  Last time out, it had a positive surprise of 3.70%, and over the last four weeks analysts have raised their estimates for the quarter by 0.03%.  ROP is a Zacks #1 Rank stock.National Oilwell-Varco (NOV) is expected to earn $1.30, up from $1.05 a year ago.  Last time out, it had a positive surprise of 7.69%, and over the last four weeks analysts have raised their estimates for the quarter by 0.89%.  NOV is a Zacks #2 Rank stock.Potential Negative Surprises:Beam Inc.

826,DWDP,"Earnings Preview 1/27/12
"
827,DWDP,"Earnings season will be in full swing this week 468 firms scheduled to report, and 99 of those will be members of the S&P 500.  By the end of the week we should have a very good handle on just how weak or strong this earnings season will be.
"
828,DWDP,"The firms reporting next week read like a who’s who of American Industry.  They include: Aflac (AFL  -  Free Report), Allstate  (ALL  -  Free Report), Clorox (CLX  -  Free Report), Dow Chemical (DOW), International Paper (IP  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), United Parcel Service (UPS), and Exxon Mobil (XOM).
"
829,DWDP,"It will also be an extremely busy week on the economic data front.  We start with Personal Income and Spending, and the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the core PCE index, Tuesday brings the Case-Schiller housing price index and Consumer Confidence.  Wednesday has the ISM manufacturing data, Auto Sales, and the ADP employment numbers, Thursday brings Productivity and Unit Labor costs.  All of that is a prologue to the really big numbers of the week: the Employment Report for January.  The market is going to have lots to chew on.Monday
"
830,DWDP,"Personal Income is expected to rise by 0.4% in December, up from a 0.1% gain in November.  The composition of Personal Income can be as important as the total.  Last month’s Personal Income growth was even weaker than the 0.1% would indicate, as income from wages and salaries fell, offset by increases in rental income and interest and dividend income.
"
831,DWDP,"Personal Spending (Personal Consumption Expenditures) are expected to have risen by 0.1% matching its November increase.  With income rising faster than spending, it will indicate an increasing Savings Rate.  Over the long term we need a higher savings rate, as it increases it slows the economy.
"
832,DWDP,"The core Personal Consumption Expenditure inflation rate, the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, is expected to edge up at a 0.2% rate, up from 0.1% in November.
"
833,DWDP," Tuesday
"
834,DWDP,"The Case-Schiller index is expected to show a year-over-year decline in home prices of 2.6% for November.  That would be a major improvement over the 3.4% year-over-year decline in October.  Since housing equity still represents the most important store of wealth for the middle class, and housing tends to be a highly leveraged asset, the direction of home prices is vital. Also, if housing prices stop falling, then fewer people will be pushed “underwater” on their mortgages.  Being underwater makes you vulnerable to foreclosure.  I think we are getting close to a bottom in housing prices, but are not quite there yet.  That does not mean that we are likely to get a strong rebound in prices, but rather a long period of bumping along the bottom.
"
835,DWDP,"The Employment Cost Index is expected to have risen by 0.4% in the fourth quarter, up from a 0.3% rise in the third quarter.  That is still a very low rate of increase.
"
836,DWDP,"The Chicago PMI, the last of the mini-ISM’s to come out is expected to edge down to 62 for January from 62.5 in December.  As a magic 50 index, any reading over 50 indicates expansion.  Thus if the consensus is right, the manufacturing economy in the Upper Midwest is still expanding at a brisk rate, but slightly slower than in December.
"
837,DWDP,"The Consumer Confidence Index is expected to increase to 67 for January, up from 64.5 in December.  While I think this is an overrated indicator since what consumers say in the surveys is often different from what they actually do, it is better to see it going up than down.  It is still at a relatively low level.Wednesday
"
838,DWDP,"The ADP Employment report is expected to show a gain of 175,000 private sector jobs in January.  In December it reported a gain of 325,000 that proved to be far too high relative to the BLS’s “official” count of 212,000 private sector jobs added.  In the past, when there has been a big disparity between the two measures, they tend to move closer to each other by the time all the revisions are in, and usually the BLS numbers get revised more.  It is still worth noting what the ADP revisions turn out to be.
"
839,DWDP,"The ISM Manufacturing index is expected to show a rise to 54.7 from 53.9 in December.  That would indicate that the manufacturing index is expanding at a solid rate, and faster than in December.  It is made up of ten sub-indexes.  Those can be as interesting and informative as the overall index.  In particular, pay close attention to the Production, Backlog, New Orders and Employment sub-indexes.
"
840,DWDP,"Construction Spending is expected to have increased by 0.4% in December, on top of a 1.2% increase in November.
"
841,DWDP,"Auto Sales in January are expected to dip to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 13.6 million from 13.6 million in December.  The December level was the highest since August 2009 (“Cash for Clunkers”).  At the bottom of the recession, sales were below a 10 million annual rate, but it is probably going to be a long time before they get back to the 17 million rate they hit before the Great Recession.Thursday
"
842,DWDP,"Weekly Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance rose by 21,000 to 377,000.  That, however, came after they fell by 52,000 the previous week, and a big jump the week before that.  The extreme volatility in recent weeks is probably due to a flawed seasonal adjustment process.  Last week’s level is probably about right.  The consensus is looking for a small decline to 375,000  These past three weeks illustrate just how volatile week-to-week numbers can be, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on (which reached 377,5000 last week).  Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.
"
843,DWDP,"Continuing Jobless Claims have been in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they rose by 88,000 to 3.554 million. That is down 465,000, or 11.6%, from a year ago. The consensus is looking for a dip to 3.525 million. Some (most?) of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits, which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 146,000 to 3.414 million last week and are down 1.205 million, or 26.0% over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits -- currently at 7.638 million. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.773 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed, all extended benefits will end at the start of March. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.
"
844,DWDP,"Productivity is expected to have increased by 0.5% in the fourth quarter, down from a 2.3% surge in the third quarter.  Over the long term, there is probably no economic measure that is more important than productivity growth, since it ultimately governs GDP per capita, or how wealthy we are as a country adjusted for the number of people we have.  However, at times of high unemployment, productivity growth can be a mixed blessing.  Making the same amount of stuff with fewer people does not put people to work.  This report will also show unit labor costs.  They tumbled 2.5% in the third quarter, as the benefits of higher productivity accrued to the owners of capital, not to those that provide labor.  They are expected to rise a still relatively low 0.6% in the fourth quarter.  Falling unit labor costs are good news for corporate profits.Friday
"
845,DWDP,"The most important economic report of the week will be the Employment report.  It is expected to show a total increase of 145,000 jobs in January, down from 200,000 in December.  Once again, the private sector is expected to account for all of the job gains and then some, with 170,000 private sector jobs added offset by 25,000 government jobs lost.  In December there were 12,000 government pink slips.  Given the relatively low level of initial jobless claims, I will take the over on this one.  Make sure to look at the revisions to previous months, which have been very positive of late.  The unemployment rate is expected to edge down to 8.5% from 8.6%.  I expect it to remain unchanged as more “discouraged” workers find their way back to the workforce, offsetting the job gains.  Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.2%, matching their December increase.  The average workweek is expected to remain steady at 34.4 hours.  There are lots of other important numbers in the report.  The duration of unemployment numbers are of particular interest given their extremely elevated level.
"
846,DWDP,"The ISM Non Manufacturing or Service index is expected to increase to 53.1 from 52.6 last month.  That would indicate that the service side of the economy is expanding at a faster pace than in December, but not doing quite as well as the manufacturing side.  As with the manufacturing index, the sub-indexes can be just as informative as the overall index.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
847,DWDP,"The best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.In the Earnings Calendar below, $999.00 should be read as N.A. Potential Positive Surprises:Ryder Systems (R) is expected to earn $0.97, up from $0.65 a year ago.  Last time out, it had a positive surprise of 6.86%, and over the last four weeks analysts have raised their estimates for the quarter by 0.40%.  R is a Zacks #1 Rank stock.Roper Industries (ROP) is expected to earn $1.21, up from $1.10 a year ago.  Last time out, it had a positive surprise of 3.70%, and over the last four weeks analysts have raised their estimates for the quarter by 0.03%.  ROP is a Zacks #1 Rank stock.National Oilwell-Varco (NOV) is expected to earn $1.30, up from $1.05 a year ago.  Last time out, it had a positive surprise of 7.69%, and over the last four weeks analysts have raised their estimates for the quarter by 0.89%.  NOV is a Zacks #2 Rank stock.Potential Negative Surprises:Beam Inc.

"
848,DWDP,"Chemicals are generally used to make a wide variety of consumer goods and are also in the agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service industries. The chemical industry itself consumes 26% of its own output. Major industrial customers include rubber and plastic products, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp and paper, and primary metals.
"
849,DWDP,"The chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years. The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic organic polymers used as plastics, fibers and elastomers. Globally, the chemical industry is mainly concentrating in three areas of the world: Western Europe, North America and Japan. Europe is the largest producer, followed by the U.S. and Japan.
"
850,DWDP,"Chemicals are a nearly $3 trillion global business, and the European Union (EU) and U.S. chemical companies are the world's largest producers.
"
851,DWDP,"The U.S. chemical industry produces 19% of the world’s chemicals output, amounting to $689 billion. The industry directly employs over 800,000 people nationwide. A total of nearly 5.5 million additional jobs are supported by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry and by the subsequent expenditure-induced activity. In addition, the U.S. chemical industry is responsible for 10% of US merchandise exports, totaling $145 billion annually, as well as 11% of all U.S. patents.Outlook
"
852,DWDP,"For 2012, the global outlook for chemicals is mixed, as the U.S. and EU face sluggish local economies and debt constraints, while output from emerging markets is expected to increase more rapidly.
"
853,DWDP,"According to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the U.S. chemicals industry will experience more moderate production increases in 2012 after a strong post-recession recovery.
"
854,DWDP,"Most major end-use markets for chemicals have recovered, helping to maintain the industry's contribution to U.S. economic growth.
"
855,DWDP,"The ACC forecasts gradual improvement this year, before a stronger recovery takes hold in 2013. U.S. chemical output is expected to slow to 1.6% in 2012 from 2011’s 3.8% pace, then rise to 2.1% in 2013.
"
856,DWDP,"The chemicals outlook indicates modest growth over the next several years, depending on certain factors including strengthening domestic demand and an improvement in exports abroad. Exports were up nearly 11% to $189 billion in 2011 and are expected to exceed $230 billion in 2014.
"
857,DWDP,"While the U.S. economy is not headed towards another recession, the European debt situation along with other economic factors pose downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook.
"
858,DWDP,"The ACC expects total growth in the European chemicals output to be weaker than its previous forecast in 2011 and 2012, due to heightened uncertainty and inventory trimming. Following a strong demand recovery with double-digit growth in 2010, much of 2011's rise in chemicals output took place in the first quarter. Since then, production has been relatively flat.
"
859,DWDP,"Nevertheless, the European Chemical Industry Council (ECIC) believes chemical industry growth will resume in 2012, strengthening slowly through the year. The industry group projects 2% year-over-year growth in 2011 and 1.5% expansion in 2012.
"
860,DWDP,"While developed nations, constrained by debt and tighter fiscal policies, are likely to expand chemical production at a moderate pace, output from the emerging markets is forecast to increase more rapidly.
"
861,DWDP,"Asia and other emerging markets will continue to lead the world in volume gains, with China and India showing the most significant increases. Chemical manufacturers in the emerging markets are expected to show 5.4% production increases in 2011, 6.2% in 2012 and 7.5% in 2013.
"
862,DWDP,"End-markets for chemical products are showing strong growth. This growth has been reflected in the earnings releases of most chemical companies for third-quarter 2011. Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), for example, reported a 20% increase in sales revenues, primarily driven by increased selling prices.
"
863,DWDP,"Combined with the restructuring and cost-saving programs that many chemical companies implemented last year, output growth is driving high earnings across the sector, to the extent that many companies are confident of out-performing full-year forecasts.
"
864,DWDP,"Based on the strong third-quarter results, Eastman Chemical Company expects fourth-quarter 2011 earnings per share to be higher than fourth-quarter 2010 and full-year 2011 earnings per share to be approximately $4.62.Celanese Corp.’s (CE  -  Free Report) revenue also grew 20% year over year to $1.81 billion in third quarter 2011 driven by higher volumes across all business segments and favorable currency impacts. Encouraged by the third-quarter strength, the company raised its outlook for full-year 2011.
"
865,DWDP,"The company now expects 2011 operating EBITDA to be at least $280 million higher than 2010’s $1,122 million and adjusted earnings per share to be at least $1.30 higher than 2010’s $3.37, based on a tax rate and diluted share count of 17% and 159 million shares, respectively.The Dow Chemical Company’s (DOW) revenue grew 17% year over year to $15.1 billion by volume (7%) and pricing (17%) gains across all business segments and geographical regions, particularly Latin America and Asia-Pacific.
"
866,DWDP,"Growth in export markets has been driven by several factors. These include favorable energy costs (natural gas) due to the abundance of newly found shale natural gas and demand from the emerging markets, where recovery and expansion have been the strongest.
"
867,DWDP,"Further, the cost-containment measures implemented by chemical companies, such as plant shutdowns, aggressive cost cutting and production improvements, should continue to bolster industry-wide margins. The resultant large cash flows could then be leveraged for growth opportunities.
"
868,DWDP,"Celanese, DuPont and Eastman Chemical have short-term Hold recommendations, while Dow Chemical has a short-term Buy recommendation.End-Market Scenario
"
869,DWDP,"In the U.S., there are 170 major chemical companies, operating internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the U.S., and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating.
"
870,DWDP,"In Europe, especially Germany, the chemical, plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industries. Together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies.
"
871,DWDP,"According to the ACC, the Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI) was flat in November 2011, following a revised 0.3% gain in October 2011. Results were mixed within the different regions, with the Gulf Coast gaining while production slipped or was flat everywhere else.
"
872,DWDP,"U.S manufacturing sector output was up 0.2% in November, following a 0.4% gain during October. Output in several key chemistry end-use markets rose, including structural panels, paper, rubber products, appliances, motor vehicles, aerospace, machinery and construction supplies.
"
873,DWDP,"Compared with November 2010, total chemical production in all regions was up 2.7% and remained ahead year-over-year in all regions. Compared with several months ago, year-over-year comparisons improved in several regions, including the Gulf Coast, Ohio Valley and Southeast.
"
874,DWDP,"The chemistry industry is one of the largest industries in the United States, a $720 billion enterprise. The manufacturing sector is the largest consumer of chemical products, and 96% of manufactured goods are touched by chemistry.Trends in Raw Material Markets
"
875,DWDP,"The chemical industry is a large consumer of oil, naphtha and natural gas, which are widely used as energy and feedstock inputs.
"
876,DWDP,"Oil prices remain uncomfortably high despite the sub-par growth outlook for the global economy, largely owing to geostrategic reasons.
"
877,DWDP,"Naphtha prices are also expected to remain elevated relative to last year’s levels. The only bright spot for the industry on the feedstock front is natural gas.
"
878,DWDP,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy shale gas, which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big energy-intensive cities. The abundant availability of shale gas is not only desirable on environmental considerations, given its lower carbon footprint relative to coal or oil, but it is also cost effective, essentially removing a key source of disadvantage for U.S. based chemicals producers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
879,DWDP,"As per the ACC, growth in the emerging markets and abundant shale gas, coupled with a dollar exchange rate that is still relatively supportive, should help drive up US chemical exports. The ACC expects China to overtake the US as the largest market for chemicals.
"
880,DWDP,"The chemical companies are looking at mergers and acquisitions as an option to grow in the current economic environment. The companies are focused on exploring growth opportunities in the emerging markets with strong performance in the fast-growing regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America, particularly China and Brazil.
"
881,DWDP,"A major deal in the space was last year’s acquisition of Danisco by DuPont (DD) for $6.3 billion. The acquisition strengthened the company’s presence in the food ingredient and enzyme markets, and will expand its presence in industrial biotechnology and biofuels.
"
882,DWDP,"The deal is in line with DuPont’s strategy to expand beyond its chemical and manufacturing focus into the “megatrend” sectors of agribusiness and alternative energy. Both industries are expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as food demand and prices increase and clean energy policies gain more ground.
"
883,DWDP,"Dow is delivering cost synergies from the Rohm & Haas acquisition and is targeting synergy capture of $2 billion by the end of 2012.WEAKNESSES
"
884,DWDP,"The global nature of the industry puts competitive issues into sharp focus. The U.S. producers have responded to competitive pressures by streamlining operations, relocating manufacturing facilities to low-cost regions closer to end-markets, and being overall more nimble and flexible in responding to market opportunities. And it is not always easy to pull this off.
"
885,DWDP,"The recent surge in commodity prices, though subsiding lately, is adding to the feedstock costs for many of these producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy, given competitive pressures. As a result, margins for a number of producers will be under pressure in the coming quarters.
"
886,DWDP,"Additionally, given the industry’s sensitivity to the global economy, a diminution of growth outlook will be a materially negative development. The recent turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty.
"
887,DWDP,"German chemical company BASF (BASFY), in the third quarter of 2011, reported a net income of EUR 1,192 million versus last year’s quarter of EUR 1,245 million (+46.3%). On January 12, 2012, BASF announced it has invested $50 million to acquire an equity ownership position in privately held Sion Power, the global leader in the development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, based in Tucson, Arizona.
"
888,DWDP,"This equity partnership expands upon an existing joint development agreement that BASF Future Business GmbH established with Sion Power in 2009 to accelerate the commercialization of Sion’s proprietary Li-S battery technology for electric and plug-in electric vehicles and other high-energy applications over the next decade.Calgon Carbon Corporation (CCC), a leader in the activated carbon sector, faces weak demand for carbon products. The company had weak volumes in 2010, and though activated carbon sales recovered to some extent in the last reported quarter, we are skeptical about its sustainability. We expect sales volumes in the segment to remain challenging as the end-markets have yet to recover fully.
"
889,DWDP,"There are other possible hurdles that chemical makers may have to face including pending rule changes within the US regulatory agencies. The U.S. EPA has proposed a sweeping new rule that could impose stricter hazardous air pollutant emissions limitation and other requirement on operators of new and existing boilers and process heaters.
"
890,DWDP,"According to EPA’s calculations, compliance with these rules would cost boiler owners $12.2 billion for implementation and annualized cost of $4.1 billion after accounting for savings resulting in mill closures.
"
891,DWDP,"The largest corporate producers worldwide with plants in numerous countries include BASF, Bayer, Braskem S.A. (BAK  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp., Degussa, The Dow Chemical Co., EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Eastman Chemical Company, ExxonMobil (XOM), INEOS, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MTU) and PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report).
"
892,DWDP,"Earnings Preview 10/21/11
"
893,DWDP,"If you thought the past week was a busy one for earnings, you ain’t seen nothing yet.  This coming week will be much busier. A total of 932 firms are scheduled to report, including 189 of the S&P 500. The table at the end of this report reads like a who’s who of American Industry.
"
894,DWDP,"The firms reporting next week include: Aflac (AFL  -  Free Report), Altria (MO  -  Free Report), Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), ConocoPhillips (COP), Dow Chemical (DOW), DuPont (DD), Ford (F), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and 3M (MMM). And that’s just the first half of the alphabet!
"
895,DWDP,"It will also be a heavy week for economic data. We have two measures of consumer sentiment: the Consumer Confidence Index and the University of Michigan Survey. We also get more insight into the housing market with the Case-Schiller Housing Price Index and the numbers on New Home Sales. Along the way, we find out about both Durable Goods orders and Personal Income and Spending. Last but not least is the biggest number of all: the first look at GDP growth in the third quarter.MondayNo numbers of particular significance. The direction of the market will probably be determined by the tone of statements coming out of the first of two European Summits held over the weekend.TuesdayThe Case-Schiller Home Price Index, the gold standard of housing price indexes, is likely to show a year-over-year decline of 3.50% for August. In June the decline was 4.11%. On a month-to-month basis, the index was up on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, but flat when seasonally adjusted in both May and June. Given that there are now 8.5 months worth of used home inventories on the market, when normal is about six months, I think we are going to see a continuation of home price declines for the rest of the year. That is particularly true for the more widely reported non-seasonally adjusted figures (I prefer to work off of the seasonally adjusted numbers, since there is significant seasonality in home prices). However, given very high levels of affordability due to low mortgage rates, and normal -- as opposed to wildly inflated -- prices relative to rents and incomes, the declines should be relatively modest. Continued weakness in used home prices is a big part of the reason that new home sales have been so weak.Consumer Confidence is expected to edge up to a reading of 46.0 from 45.4 in September. That is still a very weak reading, so don’t get too excited about the increase. Since the Consumer is 71% of the economy, this should be an important indicator. Unfortunately, what consumers say in the surveys and what they actually do are often very different. Mostly it is a coincident indicator reflecting gasoline prices and the unemployment rate. Political gridlock and the debt ceiling fiasco probably played a role in the very soft reading in August. I think that it, and the similar University of Michigan Survey, are very overrated data points. Still, that is a very low level, and is consistent with the other data we have been seeing.WednesdayNew Home Sales are expected to rise ever so slightly to a 300,000 rate from a super-weak 295,000 in August. That is simply a pathetic level, even if it is slightly off the record low set in January. The records go back to the Kennedy administration. If we do come in at 300,000, that is still lower than any month prior to 2010. Unlike used home sales, each new home sold represents a lot of economic activity. Thus, this is a very important report. Normally, new home sales are what lead the economy out of recessions, but they have been a huge drag this time around.New Orders for Durable Goods are expected to fall 1.0% September after falling 0.1% in July. Previous months are often revised significantly for this data, and those revisions can be just as important as the current month’s data.  Much of the strength last month came from the highly volatile transportation equipment segment. Since they are so high-priced, a few orders for jetliners can really push around the total number, but the orders tend to be lumpy. Excluding transportation equipment, new orders are expected to rise 0.4% after being unchanged last month.Thursday Weekly Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance come out. They had a very nice decline early in the year, but have been recently in a trading range above 400,000. Last week they fell by 6,000 to 403,000, but only after the previous week had been revised upward by 5,000, so it was really more like a 1,000 decline. I would expect a small decline this week, but nothing big enough to really change the story of very weak job growth. The consensus is looking for 403,000, or no change. The 400,000 level is important psychologically in that it has historically been the inflection point, below which we tend to create enough jobs to bring down the unemployment rate. The week-to-week numbers can be very volatile, so the four-week average is the thing to focus on. Keep an eye on the prior week’s revision as well as the change from the revised number.Continuing Jobless Claims have been in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they rose by 25,000 to 3.719 million. That is down 700,000 from a year ago. I would expect a small decline this week. The consensus is looking for 3.700 million, a very small decrease. Some (most?) of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims dropped by 68,000 last week to 3.485 million, and are down 1.581 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits -- currently at 6.697 million -- which is down 124,000 from last week (there are some timing issues, so the change in continuing and existing claims does not match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.200 million below year-ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity -- finding a new job -- and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Unless the program is renewed, all extended benefits will end in January. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers!  Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.We get the first look at GDP growth in the third quarter. The consensus is looking for a significant acceleration from the anemic 1.3% pace of the second quarter and the downright pathetic 0.4% pace of the first quarter. Still, even if we get the 2.2% growth that the consensus is looking for, it is not exactly an economic boom, and that rate would, if sustained, only very gradually bring down unemployment and bring the economy back towards its potential output. The consensus has been rising and I suspect that we might do somewhat better than expected, perhaps more like 2.5%. The make-up of GDP growth can be as important as the overall level. Growth that comes only from rebuilding of inventories is of very low quality and should be significantly discounted. Growth that comes from business investment in new equipment and software or from an improved trade position is of much higher quality and is what we want to see. Growth from Consumer and Government spending is in the middle, and should be welcomed at this point in the cycle, but not what we want to see leading the way over the long term. Hopefully investment in construction, both residential and non-residential, will be less of a drag on growth than it has been over the last few years.FridayPersonal Income is expected to rise 0.3%, after it fell 0.1% last month. Just as important as the total amount of personal income is the source of that income. Recently, growth in income from wages and salaries has been very weak, with most of the growth we have seen coming from government transfer payments, along with rental income and higher dividends. Personal Spending is expected to rise 0.6% after rising 0.2% in August. Of course, if spending rises by more than income, the savings rate will fall. Over the long term, the economy needs a higher savings rate. A falling savings rate tends to boost the economy.The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is expected to remain at its very low level of 57.5. Like the Consumer Confidence number released earlier in the week, I think this is an overrated indicator, not because of the lack of theoretical significance, but because what consumers say in the survey is often very different from what they do. Still, any increase should be welcomed.The Employment Cost index for the third quarter is expected to show an increase of 0.6 versus an increase of 0.7% in the second quarter. This is a broad measure of the cost of employing someone -- not just wages, but benefits as well. It has very important implications for both net margins and for cost-push inflation.Potential Positive or Negative Surprises
"
896,DWDP,"The best indicators of firms likely to report positive surprises are a recent history of positive surprises and rising estimates going into the report. The Zacks Rank is also a good indicator of potential surprises. Similarly, a recent history of earnings disappointments, cuts in the average estimate for the quarter in the month before the report is due and a poor Zacks Rank (#4 or #5) are often red flags pointing to a potential disappointing earnings report.

"
899,DWDP,"Chemicals are generally used to make a wide variety of consumer goods and are also used in agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service industries. The chemical industry itself consumes 26% of its own output. Major industrial customers include rubber and plastic products, textiles, apparel, petroleum refining, pulp and paper, and primary metals.
"
900,DWDP,"The chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years. The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic organic polymers used as plastics, fibers and elastomers. Globally, the chemical industry is mainly concentrated in three areas of the world: Western Europe, North America and Japan. The European community is the largest producer, followed by the U.S. and Japan.
"
901,DWDP,"Chemicals are a nearly $3 trillion global business, and the European Union (EU) and U.S. chemical companies are the world's largest producers.
"
902,DWDP,"The US chemical industry produces 19% of the world’s chemicals output, amounting to $689 billion. The industry directly employs over 800,000 people nationwide. A total of nearly 5.5 million additional jobs are supported by the purchasing activity of the chemical industry and by the subsequent expenditure-induced activity. In addition, the US chemical industry is responsible for 10% of US merchandise exports, totaling $145 billion annually, as well as 11% of all US patents.Outlook
"
903,DWDP,"The recession had hit the chemical industry hard. As a result of lack of demand, chemical companies shelved their growth plans. With plants idled or running at historically low rates, the companies tried to protect their earnings power by streamlining operations and increasing productivity. Accordingly, they resorted to restructurings, plant closures and layoffs. Cost-cutting initiatives at industry majors like The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) and EI DuPont de Nemours & Co (DD) helped them save billions of dollars.
"
904,DWDP,"With the economic turnaround, the global chemical industry is recovering from the recession-hit lows. Domestically, chemical production volumes increased across all regions in 2010, reversing the steep declines experienced in 2008 and 2009. The largest gains occurred in the Gulf Coast and Ohio Valley regions, boosted by export demand for basic chemicals and plastics. Output is expected to grow moderately in all regions in 2011 and continue to improve through 2012.
"
905,DWDP,"Concerns about the U.S. economy’s growth momentum have increased lately following the sub-par growth pace in the first half. But all evidence points towards the economy maintaining positive, though below-average, growth going forward. While recessionary risks have no doubt increased, we remain comfortable with our view that the U.S. economy will be able to stay positive.
"
906,DWDP,"End-markets for chemical products are showing strong growth. This growth has been reflected in the earnings releases of most chemical companies for second quarter 2011. Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), for example, reported a 26% increase in sales revenues, primarily due to growth in plasticizer product lines, increased demand for acetyl chemicals, the fourth quarter 2010 restart of a previously idled olefins cracking unit at the Texas facility, and strengthened end-market demand primarily in the packaging, transportation and durable goods markets.
"
907,DWDP,"Combined with the restructuring and cost-saving programs that many chemical companies implemented last year, output growth is driving high earnings across the sector, to the extent that many companies are confident of out-performing full-year forecasts.
"
908,DWDP,"Based on the strong second quarter results, Eastman Chemical Company expects third quarter 2011 earnings per share to be slightly higher than second quarter 2011 and full-year 2011 earnings per share to be slightly higher than $9.25.Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report) revenue also grew 16% year over year to $1.75 billion in second quarter 2011 driven by higher volumes across all business segments and favorable currency impacts. Encouraged by the second quarter strength, the company raised its outlook for full-year 2011.
"
909,DWDP,"The company now expects 2011 operating EBITDA to be at least $275 million higher than 2010’s $1,122 million and adjusted earnings per share to be at least $1.20 higher than 2010’s $3.37, based on a tax rate and diluted share count of 17% and 159.2 million shares, respectively.The Dow Chemical Company (DOW) revenue grew 17% year over year to $16.0 billion by volume (9%) and pricing (19%) gains across all business segments and geographical regions, particularly Latin America and Asia Pacific.
"
910,DWDP,"Growth in export markets has been driven by several factors. These include favorable energy costs (natural gas) due to the abundance of newly found shale natural gas and demand from emerging markets, where recovery and expansion have been the strongest. As per the American Chemistry Council (ACC), U.S. exports would grow by 9.7% in 2011, outpacing the expected 7.8% growth in imports.
"
911,DWDP,"Further, the cost-containment measures implemented by chemical companies, such as plant shutdowns, aggressive cost cutting and production improvements, should continue to bolster industry-wide margins. The resultant large cash flows could then be leveraged for growth opportunities.
"
912,DWDP,"Dow Chemical, Celanese, DuPont and Eastman Chemical have long-term Hold recommendations.End-Market Scenario
"
913,DWDP,"In the U.S. there are 170 major chemical companies, operating internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating.
"
914,DWDP,"In Europe, especially Germany, the chemical, plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industries. Together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies.
"
915,DWDP,"According to the ACC, the Chemical Production Regional Index (CPRI) rose 0.5% in May 2011, following a 0.3% gain in April 2011, as chemical production increased in all regions, except the Gulf Coast.
"
916,DWDP,"U.S manufacturing sector output was up 0.4% in May, following a 0.5% gain during April. Output grew in many key end-use markets for chemistry products, including construction supplies, motor vehicles, electrical equipment, furniture, paper and plastic and rubber products.
"
917,DWDP,"The U.S. homebuilding sector is a major consumer market for the chemicals industry, accounting for about 10% of chemical demand.
"
918,DWDP,"Nationwide housing starts rose 14.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 629,000 units in June 2011, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. This was the best pace of starts activity since the beginning of the year, and was attributable to significant gains registered in both the single-family and multifamily segments as well as every region of the country.Trends in Raw Material Markets
"
919,DWDP,"The chemical industry is a large consumer of oil, naphtha and natural gas, which are widely used as energy and feedstock inputs.
"
920,DWDP,"Oil prices trended upward throughout 2009, and in April 2011, crude oil prices averaged around $111 per barrel, though they have since come down lately as questions about the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery have taken center stage. Naphtha prices are also expected to remain elevated relative to last year’s levels, though they have lost ground lately as well as crude oil prices.
"
921,DWDP,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy shale gas which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big energy-intensive cities. The abundant availability of shale gas is not only desirable on environmental considerations, given its lower carbon footprint relative to coal or oil. But it is also cost effective, essentially removing a key source of disadvantage for U.S. based chemicals producers.OPPORTUNITIES
"
922,DWDP,"As per the ACC, favorable dollar exchange rates, growth in emerging markets and abundant shale gas will drive up US chemical exports and China will overtake the US as the largest market for chemicals.
"
923,DWDP,"The chemical companies are looking at mergers and acquisitions as an option to grow in the current economic environment. The companies are focused on exploring growth opportunities in emerging markets with strong performance in the fast-growing regions of Asia-Pacific and Latin America, particularly China and Brazil.
"
924,DWDP,"The United States expects growth to continue, albeit at a slower rate than last year. Business conditions are improving, with corporate profits and investments rising and industrial production showing solid gains compared with the year before.
"
925,DWDP,"One of the largest operators in this space, DuPont (DD) entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Denmark’s Danisco for $5.8 billion in cash and the assumption of $500 million of Danisco’s net debt. This marks the company’s largest acquisition since its $7.7 billion buy of Pioneer Hi-Bred International in 1999. The deal will enable DuPont to expand the company’s offerings in more specialized areas like biofuels and food enzymes.
"
926,DWDP,"DuPont is focused on capturing $1 billion in working capital productivity gains during the 2011−2013 timeframe. The company is also on track to achieve a cumulative $600 million in benefits from fixed cost productivity and restructuring actions in 2011. It is executing strategies for further development and growth of new products, particularly for agriculture, photo-voltaics, alternative energy and materials.
"
927,DWDP,"Dow is delivering cost synergies from the Rohm & Haas acquisition and is targeting synergy capture of $2 billion by the end of 2012.WEAKNESSES
"
928,DWDP,"The global nature of the industry puts competitive issues into sharp focus. U.S. producers have responded to competitive pressures by streamlining operations, relocating manufacturing facilities to low-cost regions closer to end-markets, and being overall more nimble and flexible in responding to market opportunities. And it is not always easy to pull this off.
"
929,DWDP,"The recent surge in commodity prices, though subsiding lately, is adding to the feedstock costs for many of these producers. Their ability to pass these costs on to end consumers is not always easy given competitive pressures. As a result, margins for a number of producers will be under pressure in the coming quarters.
"
930,DWDP,"Additionally, given the industry’s sensitivity to the global economy, a diminution of growth outlook will be a materially negative development. The recent turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources of near-term uncertainty.
"
931,DWDP,"German chemical company BASF (BASFY), in the first quarter of 2011, reported a net income increase by EUR 1,382 million to EUR 2,411 million (+134%). The company also announced in February that it would hire approximately 2,900 employees this year.Calgon Carbon Corporation (CCC), a leader in the activated carbon sector, faces weak demand for carbon products. The company had weak volumes in 2010 and, though activated carbon sales recovered to some extent in the last reported quarter, we are skeptical about its sustainability. We expect sales volumes in the segment to remain challenging as the end-markets have yet to recover fully.
"
932,DWDP,"There are other possible hurdles that chemical makers may have to face such as pending rule changes within US regulatory agencies. The U.S. EPA has proposed a sweeping new rule that could impose stricter hazardous air pollutant emissions limitation and other requirement on operators of new and existing boilers and process heaters.
"
933,DWDP,"According to EPA’s calculations, compliance with these rules would cost boiler owners $12.2 billion for implementation and annualized cost of $4.1 billion after accounting for savings and also result in mill closures.
"
934,DWDP,"The largest corporate producers worldwide with plants in numerous countries include BASF, Bayer, Braskem S.A. (BAK  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp., Degussa, The Dow Chemical Co., EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Eastman Chemical Company, ExxonMobil, INEOS, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MTU) and PPG Industries Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report).
"
935,DWDP,"Strong corporate earnings reports will be trying to gain traction for another day in the face of the still-unresolved Washington debate on the debt ceiling/budget issue. The soft Durable Goods numbers for June will not help matters either.
"
936,DWDP,"With the August 2 debt-ceiling deadline just days away now and the two sides still poles apart in their respective positions, the odds of a comprehensive budget deal are very low. The most likely outcome at this stage is an 11th hour kick-the-can-down-the-road solution that will provide for a temporary debt-ceiling increase, while leaving the thornier deficit reduction issue for a later date.
"
937,DWDP,"The rating agencies have painted themselves in a corner by threatening a rating downgrade if the debt ceiling increase was not accompanied by a credible enough deficit-reduction plan. They seem to be using this event as an opportunity to buttress their image following their negligent behavior in the sub-prime mortgage crisis. 
"
938,DWDP,"But the credit markets appear to have called their bluff. With the 10-year Treasury bond in the 3% vicinity, there are no signs of panic in the bond market. As such, the loss of the 'AAA' rating may not exactly be an end-of-the-world event, after all. All we need right now is for the stock market to see the issue the same way as the bond market is doing. 
"
939,DWDP,"Beyond the Washington Circus, we had a number of solid earnings reports this morning. Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) posted a solid EPS beat on inline revenue, but the top of its full-year earnings guidance came short of the current Zacks Consensus. We had a solid EPS and revenue beat from Dow Chemical (DOW), with the chemicals giant continuing to see growth momentum in its various markets. Oil giant ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), which is in the process of splitting itself into two companies, also came out with better-than-expected results. 
"
940,DWDP,"Health insurers Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) and WellPoint (WLP) posted better-than-expected results, but provided divergent outlooks, with Aetna guiding higher and WellPoint a tad lower. AutoNation (AN  -  Free Report) came out with an earnings beat, though its revenue came modestly short of expectations. Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) came out with better-than-expected top- and bottom-line results after the close on Tuesday, even as margins continued to be squeezed by the online retailer's expansion spending. In other major after-market results on Tuesday, Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) came ahead of expectations on international strength, while Juniper Networks (JNPR  -  Free Report) came short.
"
941,DWDP,"Key Points:First quarter season is in the mopping-up phase. So far 481 (96.2%) of the S&P 500 reports in. Median surprise of 3.70% and surprise ratio of 3.01 for EPS, 1.33% and 2.24 for revenues. Solid growth of 17.2% (19.4% ex-Financials) reported. Slowdown from fourth quarter pace of 30.9%, mostly due to super financial growth in 4Q. Growth ex-Financials as 19.7% in 4Q among the 481 that have reported.Quarterly net margins reported rise to 9.35% from 8.68% a year ago, up from 8.89% in fourth quarter. Margins excluding Financials rise to 8.17% from 7.50% last year, 8.00% in fourth quarter. In the second quarter 9.66% net margins expected, 8.56% ex-Financials.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 45.7% in 2010, expected to rise 14.7% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 14.3%. Financials major earnings driver in 2010. Excluding Financials growth was 27.7% in 2010, and expected to be 14.9% in 2011 and 12.8% in 2012.Total revenues for the S&P 500 rise 8.24% in 2010, expected to be up 5.47% in 2011 and 5.91% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues up 9.71% in 2010, expected to rise 8.99% in 2011 and 5.85% in 2012.Annual Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.41% in 2009 to 8.62% for 2010, 9.36% expected for 2011 and 10.13% in 2012.Margin Expansion major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 7.09% in 2009, 8.25% for 2010, 8.70% expected in 2011, and 9.28% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 1.89 for 2011, at 2.03 for 2012, both very bullish readings. Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 1.83 for 2011, 2.04 for 2012, also very positive readings. Total revisions activity close to seasonal peak.S&P 500 earned $545.6 billion in 2009, rising to $794.9 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $911.9 billion in 2011. In 2012 the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.043 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $57.20 in 2009: $83.35 in 2010 and $95.63 in 2011 expected bottom up. For 2012, $109.32 expected. Puts P/Es at 16.1x for 2010, and 14.1x for 2011 and 12.3x for 2012, very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 3.18%. Top down estimates: $95.30 for 2011 and $103.16 for 2012.Earnings Are Great, But...
"
942,DWDP,"The first quarter earnings season is almost done. We now have 481 (96.2%) of the S&P 500 reports in. Net income growth is 17.2%. While that is down from the extremely strong 30.9% those same 481 firms posted in the fourth quarter, it is still a very strong growth rate.
"
943,DWDP,"Almost all of the growth slowdown is from a failure of the Financial sector to repeat the massive growth they posted in the fourth quarter. It’s not that the Financials are having a bad quarter, but they do face much tougher comps this time around. The 8.7% year-over-year growth they are reporting is not exactly awful (although it is below the rest of the S&P 500), it is that it pales in comparison to the 161.8% growth posted in the fourth quarter. That is despite a very strong sequential growth of 22.0%.
"
944,DWDP,"If we back out the Financials, total net income is up 19.4%, down just slightly from the 20.7% those firms reported in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to the second quarter, growth is expected to continue to slow, falling 9.9%. Back out the Financials and growth is expected to be 12.4%.Revenue and Net Margin Growth
"
945,DWDP,"Revenue growth is also very strong at 8.77%, up from the 8.31% growth they posted in the fourth quarter. Financials are a major drag on revenue growth; if they are excluded, reported revenue growth is 9.52%, up from the 8.83% growth posted last quarter.
"
946,DWDP,"Revenue growth is also expected to slow in the second quarter, falling to 4.52% year over year for the S&P 500 as a whole. Revenue growth is expected to slip to 4.59% if the Financials are excluded. 
"
947,DWDP,"Net margin expansion has been a driver of earnings growth, but that expansion is slowing down, particularly if one excludes the Financials. Overall net margins are 9.35%, up sharply from 8.68% a year ago and from 9.68% in the fourth quarter. Strip away the Financials and the picture is somewhat different, rising to 8.17% from 7.50% a year ago and from the 8.00% reported in the fourth quarter.Cyclicals Leading the Way
"
948,DWDP,"The more cyclical parts of the economy are leading the growth charge this quarter. The highest growth comes from the Industrials sector, with growth of 67.1%. Three other sectors are posting growth over 40%: Materials (48.3%), Autos (46.9%) and Energy (40.5%).
"
949,DWDP,"Construction is without a doubt the weakest of the sectors, with total net income plunging 34.3% from a year ago. The only other sector will declining net income are the Utilities, down 1.1% from a year ago. Anemic but positive growth of 3.4% has been posted for Staples.
"
950,DWDP,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward. In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.41% in 2009. They hit 8.62% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.36% in 2011 and 10.13% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the Financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 7.09% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.25% in 2010. They are expected to rise to 8.80% in 2011 and 9.28% in 2012.Full-Year Expectations
"
951,DWDP,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $794.9 billion in 2010, up from $545.6 billion in 2009. In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $911.9 billion, or increases of 45.7% and 14.7%, respectively.
"
952,DWDP,"The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.043 Trillion. That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $109.32. That is up from $57.12 for 2009, $83.10 for 2010, and $96.82 for 2011.
"
953,DWDP,"In an environment where the 10 year T-note is yielding 3.18%, a P/E of 16.2x based on 2010 and 14.1x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is 12.3x.Analysts Raising Estimates
"
954,DWDP,"The analysts have responded to the better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter by raising their estimates for 2011. That’s not particularly shocking, as the first quarter is, after all, part of 2011, so if they did not increase in response to a positive surprise, they would implicitly be cutting their estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year.
"
955,DWDP,"Still, the flood of estimate increases is impressive, with the revisions ratio sitting at 1.89. Total estimate revisions activity is near its seasonal peak. Thus over the next month or so, changes in the revisions ratio will be driven more by old estimates falling out of the four-week moving totals than by new estimate changes being made.
"
956,DWDP,"The estimate increases are widespread, with the ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to firms with falling estimates standing at 1.83. There is no “mechanical reason for the estimates for 2012 to be rising. Those are even stronger than the ones for 2011.
"
957,DWDP,"The 2012 revisions ratio is now at 2.03, meaning that upwards estimate revisions are outpacing cuts by more than 2:1 for next year. The ratio of rising to falling mean estimates stands at 2.04. Those are extremely bullish readings.Strong Fundamentals for the Market
"
958,DWDP,"This provides a strong fundamental backing for the market to continue to move higher. It is important to keep your eyes on the prize. There is lots of news out there, and much of it is more dramatic than earnings results, but rarely does it have more significance for your portfolio.
"
959,DWDP,"Earnings are -- and are going to remain -- the single most important thing for the stock market. Interest rates are an important, but distant, second.Several Caveats
"
960,DWDP,"That does not mean that all is smooth sailing ahead. In a similar, but contrary nod to history, we are now at the softest part of the year (historically). There is a fair amount of truth to the old adage “Sell in May, but remember to return by November. Since 1945, the gain on the S&P 500 has averaged 6.8% (ex-dividends) from November through April, but only 1.3% from May through October.
"
961,DWDP,"The biggest threat to the market is if the debt ceiling is not raised by the beginning of August. If it looks like it will not happen, watch out. The Government of the United States defaulting on its debt is likely to have a somewhat larger impact on the markets and the economy than the impact of Lehman Brothers defaulting on its debts. The nation would be shoved right back into recession, and one deeper than the one that followed the Lehman collapse.
"
962,DWDP,"If that happens, then corporate profits would also collapse. However, when push comes to shove, I find it hard to believe that Congress would let that happen. While not the most likely case, the chance of no increase by the time the ceiling is hit is a very real possibility. Given the disastrous potential consequences, taking out some insurance in the form of deep out of the money puts would make a lot of sense at this point.Government Spending Lower
"
963,DWDP,"We are already feeling the impact from lower government spending. First quarter GDP growth came in at just 1.8%, down from 3.1% in the fourth quarter. Total government spending was a drag of 1.09 points, up from being a 0.34 point drag in the fourth quarter. In other words, 0.75 of the total 130 point growth slowdown (57.8%) was due to increased austerity in Government spending.
"
964,DWDP,"In the third quarter, government spending contributed 0.79 points of the 2.60% total growth. The lower growth will result in lower tax collections, so the impact on the budget deficit will be much less than the amount advertised.Unemployment Picture
"
965,DWDP,"The unemployment rate bounced back up to 9.0% nationally, despite the fact that it fell in 39 states in April. This was not due to, as many assume, people coming back into the labor force. It was due to the fact that the unemployment rate is derived from a separate survey from the one that measures the number of jobs gained or lost. The civilian participation rate has been stuck at the same low 64.2% level since January.
"
966,DWDP,"Given that the unemployment rate has been higher than that in just 6.17% of the months since 1960, one might expect that bringing down unemployment would be top of the agenda at both the Fed and on Capitol Hill. However, at Bernanke’s recent press conference, the focus was mostly on inflation. The rate of headline inflation has been moving higher, but it is only up 3.2% over the last year. That is lower than what we have experienced for most of the last 40 years.Commodity Prices
"
967,DWDP,"Furthermore, commodity prices have just fallen sharply, so we might start to see some relief very soon. Core inflation remains very low, up just 1.3% over the last year. This fear of phantom inflation is keeping further monetary easing off the table for bringing down unemployment. Because of the deficit, fiscal policy is also off the table, even though those who seem to scream loudest about it are unwilling to raise an extra nickel of tax revenue.International Scene
"
968,DWDP,"The international situation clearly has the potential to abort the recovery as well. The disaster in Japan will clearly slow its economy dramatically in the second quarter, although much of that growth will be made up later in the year as the reconstruction process gets underway. Many U.S.-made products have parts which are made in Japan and that is likely to disrupt production here.
"
969,DWDP,"Factory output fell 0.4%, the first decline after 9 months of increases largely due to auto plants shut down for the lack of parts. The debt crisis in Europe is not going away, with Portugal now also getting bailed out, even as the ECB makes life tougher on the PIIGS by raising rates. Rates for the Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt are substantially higher than when the crisis first started.
"
970,DWDP,"It is clear now that at least Greece will be forced to restructure (aka partially default) its debt. The austerity campaigns have weakened those economies and undermined tax revenues, and so the bailouts have not made the situation much better.Domestic Housing
"
971,DWDP,"Here at home, the housing situation has not been showing many signs of improvement, and I doubt we will see much in the housing related numbers due out this week. Note that the Construction sector is the weakest in terms of both surprises and estimate revisions.In Conclusion
"
972,DWDP,"On balance I remain bullish, and I think we will end the year with the S&P 500 north of 1400, but that does not mean we will have a smooth ride between here and there. Strong earnings are trumping a dicey international situation, and the drama in DC. However, be prepared to move to the exits (or have some put protection in place) if it looks like the debt ceiling will not be raised.
"
973,DWDP,"As far as individual stock picks are concerned, look for the combination of a Zacks #1 Rank, with moderate P/Es and a reasonable dividend yield. The current issue of Earnings Trends has a list of the firms with the largest positive revisions for this year.
"
974,DWDP,"The best hunting ground for such firms seems to be in the Industrial, Materials and Energy sectors, but things are not limited to that sector. Some of the names to consider among the S&P 500 include AK Steel (AKS  -  Free Report), Dow Chemical (DOW), United Health (UNH  -  Free Report) and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report).Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseThe first quarter season almost done. So far, 481 (96.2%) of S&P reports in. Results strong, with year-over-year growth of 17.2%, a 3.01 surprise ratio and 3.70% median surprise. 67.6% of all firms beat expectations.Positive year-over-year growth for 350, falling EPS for 129 firms, 2.48 ratio, 72.8% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.The numbers are unlikely to change much. Nine sectors done, 4 others have only one or two left.Autos, Industrials, Discretionary, Conglomerates and Energy all have median surprises over 6.5%. All sectors have more positive surprises than disappointments.Note that the sectors with high positive surprises also have best revisions.
"
975,DWDP,"Historically, a “normal earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus this quarter is about average. Pay attention to the percent reporting in evaluating the significance of the sector numbers.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise 1Q Reported Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegAuto 46.88% 100.00% 8.16 6 1 7 0Industrial Products 67.11% 95.24% 8.09 16 4 16 4Consumer Discretionary 16.69% 90.63% 7.32 22 4 22 7Conglomerates 29.30% 100.00% 6.60 7 2 8 1Oils and Energy 40.45% 100.00% 6.51 26 13 24 16Basic Materials 48.26% 100.00% 5.62 21 2 22 1Finance 8.74% 100.00% 5.36 54 19 58 22Computer and Tech 24.95% 93.06% 4.35 45 15 50 16Medical 6.22% 91.49% 4.05 37 4 36 7Retail/Wholesale 5.48% 95.74% 2.86 31 7 34 11Aerospace 5.04% 100.00% 2.65 6 2 6 3Business Service 12.62% 89.47% 2.38 9 4 12 5Construction -34.25% 100.00% 1.32 3 6 4 7Utilities -1.09% 100.00% 1.01 22 13 24 17Consumer Staples 3.42% 86.11% 0.96 16 9 19 11Transportation 23.82% 100.00% 0.00 4 3 8 1S&P 500 17.23% 96.20% 3.70 325 108 350 129Sales SurprisesStrong revenue growth of 8.77% among the 481 that have reported, median surprise 1.33%, surprise ratio of 2.24, 68.6% of all firms reporting better than expected revenues.

978,DWDP,"The first table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. The second shows the largest declines. To qualify, there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1, and have a mean estimate of more than $0.50. In addition, to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.
"
979,DWDP,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00. Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.

980,DWDP,"We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2011, not all firms are on December fiscal years, this can cause discontinuities in the data.  The data is based on FY1, not based on 2011, even though I may call it 2011 in the report. All numbers, including historical ones, reflect the current composition of the S&P 500, thus some historical numbers may differ from those reported by S&P which are based on the composition of the index at the time of the reports.

981,DWDP,"Industry Rank Analysis 5-18-11 
"
982,DWDP,"I have written about the Chemical industry several times recently in this space, the last time being in mid-April. However, it continues to show up very well in the Zacks Rank. As the Zacks Rank is largely based on short-term changes (4 week) in earnings estimates, and by earnings surprises, the continued strength for the industry does represent new information.
"
983,DWDP,"Few firms had reported their first quarter results then, and almost all have now. The Diversified Chemical Industry, which I wrote about then, has since been joined by the Specialty Chemical industry near the top of the list.
"
984,DWDP,"The strong performance of the Chemical industry is a little bit counter intuitive, in that it is a huge user of Energy, specifically petroleum, and one would expect a margin squeeze from rapidly rising oil prices. It appears that demand is strong enough for Chemicals that the firms have enough clout to pass through the higher energy costs to their customers.
"
985,DWDP,"Chemicals go into a wide variety of products, and the strength in this group is a good indication of overall worldwide economic strength. I would note though that many of the integrated oil firms also have large Chemical operations, so strength in there and in Chemicals at the same time is not totally contradictory.Zacks Industry Classifications
"
986,DWDP,"The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 256 different industries tracked.  It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well, a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts. It is interesting when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list. The same holds true for the bottom of the list. The definition of size that matters here is not the total sales or market capitalization but the number of companies in the “industry.  Chemicals Getting a Positive Reaction
"
987,DWDP,"The Diversified Chemical industry is a large one. It has 32 firms in it, and many of these firms are huge, household names, even if their direct exposure to the customer is sometimes limited. A large number of firms makes it much less likely that the industry will end up o the top (or bottom, for that matter) of the charts. The industry is currently in 18th place, a deterioration of six spots from last week, with an average score of 2.38 up from 2.28.
"
988,DWDP,"The Specialty Chemical industry is also larger than average with 26 firms. It is currently in 22nd place, an improvement of 31 spots as the average Zacks rank has tumbled to 2.42 from 2.73.
"
989,DWDP,"Those firms tend to be more stable and less cyclical than the Diversified Chemical firms. The output of the Diversified Chemical firms tends to be measured in tons, the output of the specialty firms in pounds. The Diversified Chemical firms are often major suppliers to the Specialty Chemical firms. The specialty chemical firms tend to be smaller than the Diversified Chemical firms.Strong Buys and Buys
"
990,DWDP,"The first table shows the Chemical stocks that hold the enviable Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy). The second table shows the Zacks #2 Ranked (Buy) firms. If the Zacks ranks were random, one would expect that only 5% of the firms in an industry would be “#1s and 15% would be “#2s.
"
991,DWDP,"That is not the case with these two Chemical industries. Eleven of them (19.0%) have number one ranks, and 22 (37.9%) have number two ranks. There is a wide spectrum of market capitalizations to choose from on the lists ranging from mega-caps like BASF (BASFY  -  Free Report) and Dow (DOW), down to the tiny China Carbon  and Flexible Solutions (FSI  -  Free Report).
"
992,DWDP,"This is a worldwide industry, and several of the firms are ADRs. Valuations are for the most part reasonable, particularly if you are willing to look out to 2012 earnings. The estimates on these firms are rising, and an estimate in motion tends to stay in motion, so the true P/E on these firms might be lower than it looks based on current estimates.Number 1 Ranked FirmsCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Curr FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est % Change Curr FY Est - 4 wk % Change Next FY Est - 4 wk Current PriceBasf Ag-Adr New BASFY $83,003  10.12 9.23 7.59% 10.30% $90.37 Dow Chemical DOW $45,017  13.25 10.99 12.60% 3.84% $38.37 Sigma Aldrich SIAL $8,390  18.59 16.91 4.46% 4.53% $68.88 Celanese Cp-A CE $8,056  11.85 10.49 9.11% 7.54% $51.63 Huntsman Corp HUN $4,607  10.85 9.22 25.42% 16.57% $19.14 Rhodia Adr RHAYY $4,588  8.29 N/A 13.86% N/A $44.25 Rockwood Hldgs ROC $3,840  14.23 12.1 25.26% 20.65% $50.44 Kronos Worldwd KRO $3,133  9.6 8 28.83% 17.37% $54.07 Olin Corp OLN $1,874  12.2 10.09 12.75% 9.10% $23.52 Chemtura Corp CHMT $1,724  19.8 12.09 14.47% 15.06% $18.02 Globe Specialty GSM $1,574  25.53 14.45 8.37% 4.83% $20.93 Number 2 Rated FirmsCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Curr FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est % Change Curr FY Est - 4 wk % Change Next FY Est - 4 wk Current PriceDu Pont (Ei) De DD $49,014  13.74 12.11 4.05% 5.09% $52.91 Air Liquide-Adr AIQUY $37,930  16.68 14.87 2.89% 3.46% $26.69 Praxair Inc PX $31,225  18.86 16.5 0.65% 1.39% $102.85 Lyondellbasel-A LYB $22,539  9.35 8.6 34.64% 31.82% $39.68 Air Prods & Che APD $19,485  15.81 14.07 1.12% 2.09% $90.66 Akzo Nobel Nv AKZOY $17,043  13.32 10.98 10.26% 15.15% $72.99 Ppg Inds Inc PPG $14,242  13.55 12.36 2.84% 3.77% $88.47 Ecolab Inc ECL $12,082  20.71 18.12 0.93% 0.84% $52.07 Eastman Chem Co EMN $7,428  11.55 10.56 12.13% 12.21% $104.55 Albemarle Corp ALB $6,255  15.71 13.54 7.42% 11.10% $68.26 Grace (Wr) New GRA $3,218  13.16 12.57 12.70% 16.67% $44.00 Methanex Corp MEOH $2,810  13.01 9.17 6.46% 9.05% $30.31 Cytec Inds Inc CYT $2,728  16.16 13.57 1.84% 3.83% $55.17 Newmarket Corp NEU $2,423  12.35 11.52 5.14% 8.25% $174.77 Sensient Tech SXT $1,880  15.95 14.53 1.40% 1.27% $37.60 Georgia Gulf GGC $1,004  13.22 9.08 2.19% 26.61% $29.55 Innophos Hldgs IPHS $953  11.26 10.5 1.63% 2.26% $44.36 Tpc Group Inc TPCG $632  17.48 11.7 0.00% 6.74% $38.90 Quaker Chemical KWR $454  11.55 10.53 7.90% 3.60% $39.45 Omnova Solution OMN $395  12.04 8.84 0.00% 0.00% $8.73 Flexible Soltns FSI $29  34.17 18.64 20.00% N/A $2.05 China Carbon Gr CHGI $24  4.8 N/A 78.57% N/A $1.20 
"
993,DWDP,"In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things: a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks #1 and #2 Ranked stocks than #4 or #5 Ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week. It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is.
"
994,DWDP,"The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank.
"
995,DWDP,"Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked.
"
996,DWDP,"The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

"
998,DWDP,"OVERVIEW
"
999,DWDP,"Chemicals are essential to millions of consumer goods, enabling hi-tech  advances in industries as diverse as aerospace, computing and  telecommunications. The chemical industry comprises companies engaged in  the conversion of raw materials -- oil, natural gas, air, water, metals  -- that are then used to make a wide variety of consumer goods, as well  as inputs for agriculture, manufacturing, construction and service  industries.
"
1000,DWDP,"Globally, the chemical industry is mainly concentrated in three areas of  the world: Western Europe, North America and Japan. The European  community is the largest producer, followed by the U.S. and Japan. The  chemical industry, one of the largest in the U.S., is an enterprise  worth $674 billion. This industry is also one of the top exporters in  the country.
"
1001,DWDP,"The U.S. chemical industry operates through 170 major chemical companies  with international operations spanning more than 2,800 facilities  outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates. The  sector generates an annual chemical output worth $400 billion. The U.S.  industry records large trade surpluses and employs around a million  people. It is also the second largest consumer of energy in the  manufacturing sector.Outlook
"
1002,DWDP,"The recession had hit the chemical industry hard. Shying from a lack of  demand, chemical companies shelved their growth strategies. With plants  idled or running at historically low rates, the companies looked for  avenues to streamline operations and increase productivity. Accordingly,  they resorted to restructurings, plant closures, and layoffs.  Cost-cutting initiatives at industrial majors -- The Dow Chemical  Company  (DOW) and EI  DuPont de Nemours & Co.  (DD) -- amounted to  billions of dollars.
"
1003,DWDP,"The global chemical industry is, however, recovering from the  recession-hit lows. Domestically, chemical production volumes have  increased across all regions of the United States in 2010, reversing the  steep declines experienced in 2008 and 2009. The largest gains have  occurred in the Gulf Coast and Ohio Valley regions, boosted by export  demand for basic chemicals and plastics. Output is expected to grow  moderately in all regions in 2011 and continue to improve through 2012.
"
1004,DWDP,"Growth in export markets has been driven by several factors. These  include favorable energy costs, resulting from developments in  extracting natural gas from shale; and demand from emerging markets,  where recovery and expansion have been the strongest. As per the  American Chemistry Council (ACC), U.S. exports would grow by 9.7% in  2011, outpacing the expected 7.8% growth in imports.
"
1005,DWDP,"Further, the cost-containment measures implemented by chemical  companies, such as plant shutdowns, aggressive cost cutting and  production improvements, should continue to bolster industry-wide  margins. The resultant large cash flows could then be leveraged for  growth opportunities.
"
1006,DWDP,"Following a massive decline in fertilizer sales and consumption in 2009,  the speed and extent of the recovery in the first half of 2010 has been  stellar, leading to an annual increase of 13% and 7% over 2009,  respectively. The International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA) is  projecting growth in global fertilizer consumption of 4.7% for  2010/2011 and 3.8% for 2011/12. By 2011/12, nutrient application rates  would fully recover to levels seen prior to the economic crisis of 2008.
"
1007,DWDP,"The fertilizer industry will be able to absorb the incremental demand  for food, feed, fiber and energy production on the strength of its  investments hitherto made. Between 2010 and 2015, some 55 urea units, 20  potash expansion projects and 40 processed phosphates facilities are  planned for completion worldwide.
"
1008,DWDP,"The industry has spent close to $40 billion on new capacity for all  three major nutrients since 2008. IFA estimates that another $80 billion  will be invested between 2011 and 2015, with the highest levels of  production, sales and consumption seen to date occurring in 2011. Global  urea capacity is projected to expand by 30% between 2009 and 2014 to  222 million tons (Mt). During the same period, world potash and  phosphates capacity is forecast to grow by 25% and 31%, respectively.End-Market Scenario
"
1009,DWDP,"The U.S. home building sector is a major consumer market for the  chemicals industry accounting for about 10% of chemical demand.  According to the ACC, every 100,000 group of housing starts generates  $1.5 billion in chemical sales. As per the National Association of Home  Builders (NAHB), new housing starts marginally rose 7% for 2010.  However, on the plus point, NAHB expects annual housing starts for  single-family homes to climb a much stronger 21% to 575,000 units in  2011.
"
1010,DWDP,"On the flipside, U.S. unemployment will remain high in 2011; credit  markets remain tight and mortgage rates will likely increase in 2011,  thus limiting any noteworthy rebound in the housing market. We expect  the housing sector to begin a slow recovery toward its pre-recession  peaks in 2011.
"
1011,DWDP,"The Auto sector accounts for 10% of the chemical industry’s demand. The  automotive industry has started showing signs of recovery. The ACC  estimates U.S automobile sales will reach 12.7 million units in 2011.  The remaining demand comes from the agriculture, architectural and  industrial coatings, paper and textile, electronics and other  industries.
"
1012,DWDP,"Growing emerging markets should propel production in the paper and  textile industry while the electrical industry is expected to pick up  with increased industrial investment. Other industries, including food  and agriculture, are also likely to gain momentum with the recovering  economy.Trends in Raw Material Markets
"
1013,DWDP,"The chemical industry is a large consumer of oil, naphtha and natural gas, which are widely used as energy and feedstock input.
"
1014,DWDP,"Oil prices trended upward throughout 2009, and in 2010 crude oil prices  averaged around $79 per barrel. With current economic conditions  improving worldwide, global demand for oil is rising, leading to higher  prices. Naphtha prices are also expected to rise in early 2011, fueled  by robust global crude prices, as bitterly cold winters in Europe and  U.S. spark demand for home heating.
"
1015,DWDP,"Natural gas working inventories ended 2010 were 3.1 trillion cubic feet  (Tcf), about 1% below the record-setting end-of-December 2009 level.  Inventories are expected to remain at or near record-high levels through  most of 2011. EIA expects total natural gas consumption to decline by  0.9% in 2011 and residential and commercial consumption to drop 2.7% in  2011 due to fewer heating days in the winter months this year compared  with last year.
"
1016,DWDP,"Over the past five years, the U.S. natural gas markets have seen a  dynamic shift due to the emergence of a new source of energy -- shale  gas -- which exists in large quantities with sources close to many big  energy-intensive cities. The shales ensure a cleaner power source than  coal or oil.
"
1017,DWDP,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
1018,DWDP,"Chemical companies spent much of the past two years on their core  business and tailoring their business processes and structure toward  becoming more efficient. Consequently, many of these companies have  ended up with excess cash on their balance sheets. Growth by further  reducing costs is not a viable option anymore as most companies have  already taken drastic measures to cut costs and improve operating  efficiencies.
"
1019,DWDP,"The chemical companies are seeing mergers and acquisitions as an option  to grow in the current economic environment. Thus, there has been a  pickup in the volume of deals announced during 2010, a substantial  increase from the previous year, indicating that that the global economy  is stabilizing.
"
1020,DWDP,"The companies are focused on exploring growth opportunities in emerging  markets with strong performance in fast-growing regions of Asia-Pacific  and Latin America, particularly China and Brazil. The United States  expects growth to continue, albeit at a slower rate than last year.  Business conditions are improving, with corporate profits and  investments rising and industrial production showing solid gains  compared with the year before.
"
1021,DWDP,"The world’s second-largest seed maker, DuPont recently entered into a  definitive agreement to acquire Denmark ’s Danisco for $5.8 billion in  cash and assumption of $500 million of Danisco’s net debt. This marks  the company’s largest acquisition since its $7.7 billion buy of Pioneer  Hi-Bred International in 1999. The deal will enable DuPont to expand the  company’s offerings in more specialized areas like biofuels and food  enzyme.
"
1022,DWDP,"DuPont is focused on capturing $1 billion in working capital  productivity gains during the 2011−2013 timeframe. The company is also  on track to achieve a cumulative $600 million in benefits from fixed  cost productivity and restructuring actions in 2011. It is executing  strategies for further development and growth of new products,  particularly for agriculture, photovoltaics, alternative energy and  materials.
"
1023,DWDP,"Dow is delivering cost synergies from the Rohm & Haas acquisition  and, in its 2010 third quarter, the company delivered more than $975  million in sales on a run-rate basis, already exceeding the year-end  target of $500 million. Dow is targeting an acquisition growth synergy  run-rate of $2 billion by the end of 2012.
"
1024,DWDP,"In April 2010, CF Industries Holdings Inc.  (CF  -  Free Report) acquired its  long-chased rival Terra Industries for $4.7 billion. With this  acquisition, CF has become the global leader in the nitrogen fertilizer  industry with a wide geographical footprint and a total capacity of 6.3  million nutrient tons of nitrogen and 2.1 million nutrient tons of  phosphate.
"
1025,DWDP,"Similarly, fertilizer manufacturer Agrium is growing through a  combination of acquisitions and organic expansion. Agrium’s recent  acquisition of AWB Ltd., a leading agricultural retailer in Australia,  will broaden its rural product sales business, including fertilizers and  herbicides, in Australia, the world’s fourth-largest wheat exporter and  third-largest shipper of canola.
"
1026,DWDP,"Another major deal in the chemical space is the pending Airgas Inc. (ARG) - Air Products & Chemicals Inc.  (APD  -  Free Report) merger valued at  around $5.9 billion, excluding debt. If it materializes, the Air  Products and Airgas association would form the world’s largest  industrial gas company. With the acquisition of Airgas, Air Products  plans a foray into the North American packaged gas business.
"
1027,DWDP,"Dow Chemical, DuPont, Agrium, Air Products and CF Industries have long-term Neutral recommendations.WEAKNESSES
"
1028,DWDP,"The chemical industry as a whole remains heavily exposed to economic  cycles and pretty much all of the industry’s underperformance of the  last two years can be attributed to the economic turmoil. The global  economic meltdown led to weak industrial demand for chemicals, resulting  in an under-utilization of production capacity, perpetrating a dramatic  fall in operating profits worldwide.
"
1029,DWDP,"While the global economic recovery appears to be firmly in place, the  recent turmoil in Europe and its impact on global growth remain sources  of near-term uncertainty. Chemical stalwarts like Dow and DuPont have  significant exposure to Europe with around 25% of their net sales coming  from the region.
"
1030,DWDP,"In Europe, disparate growth rates have been reported across the  continent. Economic conditions have shown improvement in northern Europe  and in the emerging countries of eastern Europe. Meanwhile, growth in  southern Europe continues to be restrained by sovereign debt concerns  and tightening in government spending.
"
1031,DWDP,"On the domestic front, we expect the U.S. economy's recovery to continue  to face headwinds from high unemployment, slow job growth, and  continued weakness in residential and commercial construction. Moreover,  expected monetary easing could lead to inflation in dollar-denominated  commodity prices and deflationary pressure on wages and asset values.
"
1032,DWDP,"Weak residential and commercial construction demand continues to affect  companies engaged in paint and coatings. Revenues and margins for Sherwin-Williams  (SHW  -  Free Report), the largest US  producer of paints and coatings, declined significantly in 2009.  Although demand in these end-markets is beginning to turn around of  late, it essentially remains weak, and industry-wide volume is down  significantly from peak levels achieved a few years ago.
"
1033,DWDP,"We do not expect a near-term recovery in the housing and construction  markets with declining home sales and consumer spending. We are highly  concerned about further declines in commercial construction, which  comprises around 30% of the company’s architectural paint sales.
"
1034,DWDP,"Sherwin’s peer, The Valspar Corporation  (VAL), however fared  better on the revenue front in its Paint segment in its recent quarter  driven by investment in new brands as well as higher volumes in the  global consumer and automotive refinish product lines. However,  operating income was affected by higher costs.
"
1035,DWDP,"Valspar will find it extremely difficult to achieve the level of price  increases necessary to fully offset these higher costs. Moreover, there  is a huge lag between high raw material costs and Valspar’s pricing  gains, which would continue to restrain margins.Calgon Carbon Corporation  (CCC), a leader in the  activated carbon sector, faces weak demand for carbon products. The  insipid global economy hurt volumes in 2009 and, though activated carbon  sales recovered to an extent in the last reported quarter, we are  skeptical about its sustainability. We expect sales volumes in the  segment to remain challenging as the end-markets are yet to recover  fully.
"
1036,DWDP,"There are other possible hurdles that chemical makers may have to face  such as pending rule changes within US regulatory agencies. Recently the  U.S. EPA has proposed a sweeping new rule that could impose stricter  hazardous air pollutant emissions limitation and other requirement on  operators of new and existing boilers and process heaters.
"
1037,DWDP,"According to EPA’s calculations, compliance with these rules would cost  boiler owners $12.2 billion to implement and annualized cost of $4.1  billion after accounting for savings and also result in mill closures.
"
1038,DWDP,"Sherwin-Williams, Valspar, and Calgon Carbon have long-term Neutral recommendations.                    
"
1039,DWDP,"Earnings Preview 7/30/10
"
1040,DWDP,"Earnings season will be still going strong next week. There will be 1,161 firms reporting, including 106 S&P 500 firms. The firms reporting are some of the biggest and most important bellwethers of the economy, and slice across a wide spectrum of industries. Included in next week's line up are: Archer Daniels Midland (ADM  -  Free Report), Dow Chemical (DOW), Duke Power (DUK), Kraft Foods (KFT), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Time Warner (TWX). By the end of the week, more than seven-eighths of the earnings will be in for the S&P 500.
"
1041,DWDP,"In addition to earnings there will also be a very busy week for economic data. We start with Construction Spending and end the week with the all-important employment report on Friday. In between, we get both the ISM Manufacturing and Service surveys, personal Income and Spending and Auto Sales. More than enough data on the economic front to significantly move the markets.MondayConstruction Spending is expected to have dropped by 1.0% in June on top of a 0.2% decline in May. On the commercial side, the vacancy rate for offices and shopping centers remains very high, which limits the need to build more of them. On the residential side, new housing starts have been weak, as have building permits, indicating weak spending on that side as well.The ISM manufacturing index is expected to fall to 53.5 in July to 56.2 in June. Any reading over 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding, but a reading of 53.5 would mean a much slower rate of expansion than in June, and June was off from 59.7 in May. This spring, the manufacturing sector was the star of the recovery, but that star appears to be dimming. In addition to the main index, it is important to look at the key sub-indexes for the current level of production and the rate of new orders and employment.TuesdayPersonal Income is expected to have grown by 0.2% in June, down from 0.4% growth in May. At the same time, personal spending is expected to be up just 0.1% down from 0.2% in May. If income is rising faster than spending, it means that the savings are is going up. Over the long term that is a good thing, but in the short term it means lower economic growth. The savings rate is still very low by any historical perspective, and is also low relative to that of almost every other major economy. Unfortunately, there is no way to go from a low savings rate to a high one with out the savings rate rising. However, spending going up slower than income is less painful than income falling more slowly than spending.The Fed’s favorite measure of inflation, the Core PCE price index, is expected to have risen only 0.1% in June, down from 0.2% in May. Clearly runaway inflation is not a major threat right now. The big danger is that we might actually slip into deflation, which would be a very negative thing for the economy.Factory orders are expected to be up 0.8% in June after falling 1.4% in May. Given the weak report for new orders for durable goods, don’t be surprised if this comes in lower than the “official expectations.Detroit will release its auto sales for July. Auto sales are expected to have rebounded slightly to an annual rate of 3.9 million from 3.7 million in June. However, light truck sales, like pick ups and SUVs, are expected to have dropped to a 4.5 million rate from 4.8 million. While the sales rate on both Autos and Trucks will be higher than a year ago, they remain very depressed compared to pre-recession levels.WednesdayThe ADP employment report serves as an appetizer for the main BLS report on Friday. It focuses just on private sector payrolls, and ADP is in a good position to know, since it actually cuts the paychecks for most major corporations. It is expected to show a gain of 30,000 private sector jobs in July, up from a gain of just 13,000 in June. That, however, is not the sort of growth that is needed to put a serious dent in the unemployment rate, but it sure beats losing jobs hand over fist like we were a year ago.The ISM service index covers a much bigger part of the U.S. economy than does the ISM manufacturing survey, but does not have as long a history. Like the Manufacturing survey released on Monday, any number over 50 indicates expansion. The July number is expected to have dipped slightly to 53.2 from 53.8 in June. That means the economy is still expanding but at a somewhat slower rate.Thursday Weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance come out. They fell 11,000 in the last week, to 457,000. After a huge downtrend from mid-April through the end of 2009, initial claims have become very erratic so far in 2010. Look for them to fall modestly again next week. Longer term, we have made good progress, but not good enough. We probably need for weekly claims (and the four-week moving average of them) to get down to closer to 400,000 to signal that the economy is adding enough jobs to make a dent in the unemployment rate. We are a lot closer now than we were last spring when they were running north of 640,000 on a consistent basis, but still have a ways to go. Continuing claims have also been in a steep downtrend of late. But last week they rose by 81,000 to 4.565 million. That is still down 1.570 million from a year ago. Part of the longer-term decline is due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Federally paid extended claims fell by 269,000 to 4.577 million. However that is due to even the extended claims running out as a bill to further extend benefits has been stalled in the Senate. The filibuster was eventually overcome two weeks ago. Given the delays in the data, next week will again show a big increase due to the people who were thrown off the benefit rolls due to the Senate delay coming back into the system. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now, given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.225 million, which is down 188,000 from last week. The total number of people getting benefits is now 1.2 million below year-ago levels. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.FridayThe biggest number of the week comes at the end of the week when the employment report comes out. It is expected to show a loss of 116,000 jobs on top of a loss of 125,000 jobs in June. However, the situation is not quite that bleak, more than all of the jobs lost in June were due to temporary Census workers completing their jobs, and the same is likely to be true in July. We will probably see a modest gain in private sector payrolls (the ADP number is a reasonable forecast).The Unemployment rate (U-3) is expected to tick up to 9.6% from 9.5% in June. That is partly due to the end of Census jobs, and partly due to people who have been out of the workforce expected to jump back into the workforce. In addition to the unemployment rate, which gets all the headlines, look at the actual employment rate, or the percentage of the population that is actually working. Unless we totally do away with the idea of retirement and scrap all child labor laws that rate will never get close to 100%. However, it has been in a steep downtrend, in recent years.Other key measures in the employment report to look at include the average work week, which is expected to be unchanged at 34.1 weeks in July, and average hourly earnings, which are expected to rise by 0.1% in July after falling 0.1% in June. While a slight increase is better than a decrease, it is not enough to give consumers that much firepower to increase spending and thus power the economy forward. Another thing to look at will be the number of long-term unemployed and the duration of unemployment metrics. In June, the median duration of unemployment was 25.5 weeks, more than twice as long as the record prior to the Great Recession. Long term unemployment is a very different experience than the “unplanned vacation that short-term unemployment represents.Even with the anemic growth in incomes (see the expectations for average hourly earnings and personal income) consumers have been trying to repair their tattered personal balance sheets. In addition to saving more, they have been paying down consumer credit (which does not include mortgages). In June, consumer credit fell by $9.1 billion. Look for another decline in July.Potential Positive Surprises

1046,DWDP,"Dow is one of those companies that many people have heard of but they don't know exactly what it is the company does. Founded in 1897 to sell commercial bleach, Dow now manufactures over 5,000 products at 214 facilities in 37 countries so it's not surprising that what it actually ""does"" is a bit amorphous. 
"
1047,DWDP,"It's best known for its specialty chemical, advanced materials, agrosciences and plastics businesses, however. Dow's Strategy Through 2015
"
1048,DWDP,"At a recent investor conference on May 19, Dow projected a 10% annual revenue growth rate with sales expected to grow to $12 billion by 2012 and $16 billion by 2015.
"
1049,DWDP,"Its Dow Advanced Materials division is expected to expand profitability as it has a $7 billion innovation pipeline.
"
1050,DWDP,"The company is expanding its international operations, regardless of the global recession. It is constructing a new Dow Electronic Materials R&D facility in Korea, investing in a new Dow Coating Materials emulsions plant in eastern China and expanding its Italian Water & Process Solutions facility.Analysts See Big Earnings Growth in 2010
"
1051,DWDP,"You would expect a company that is involved in many of the building blocks of various industries to be amongst the first to see improvement once the global economy turns around and that is the case with Dow.
"
1052,DWDP,"Analysts are very optimistic about 2010, seeing earnings growth of 169%. The full year Zacks Consensus is up a penny to $1.69 in the last 30 days.
"
1053,DWDP,"Growth is expected to continue in 2011, with earnings expected to jump by 53% to $2.59 per share.
"
1054,DWDP,"Comparatively, Dow made just 63 cents during the worst of the crisis in 2009.
"
1055,DWDP,"Still, not all analysts are equally enthused. One has a sell on the company and another has a strong sell. These are unchanged in the last 3 months. 
"
1056,DWDP,"You can see the consensus estimates are charting upward growth until at least 2012.Value Fundamentals

"
1062,DWDP,"Key Points:
"
1063,DWDP,"Earnings Surprise ratio (#beat/#miss) at 5.96, almost double normal
"
1064,DWDP,"Median Earnings Surprise  7.56%, very strong
"
1065,DWDP,"Year over year Earnings Growth ratio (# Pos Growth/# Neg Growth) at 0.66
"
1066,DWDP,"Sales Surprise Ratio at 1.54
"
1067,DWDP,"Sales Growth Ratio at just 0.41
"
1068,DWDP,"Total Net Income for S&P 500 reported so far is 6.1% below what those same 198 firms reported a year ago, 5.4% above what they earned in the 2Q09
"
1069,DWDP,"Total S&P 500 Revenues reported so far down 4.7% year over year, up 0.5% from 2Q09
"
1070,DWDP,"2009 Earnings Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 up to 2.48, 2010 ratio at 2.17
"
1071,DWDP,"S&P500 expected to earn $560.3 billion in 2008, $699.6 billion in 2010
"
1072,DWDP,"So far, at least relative to expectations, we are off to a fantastic earnings season. With almost 40% of reports in there have been 155 which have exceeded expectations while only 26 have fallen short, a ratio of almost 6:1. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
1073,DWDP,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two -- there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.56%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
1074,DWDP,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 79 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 119 which have fallen short of year ago levels, a ratio of 0.66.
"
1075,DWDP,"The disparity between firms beating estimates, but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 25:1. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.52.
"
1076,DWDP,"A similar situation, but not quite as extreme, is true for Materials. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
1077,DWDP,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 198 firms that have already reported are 4.7% below year-ago levels. A total of 105 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus only 68 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.54.
"
1078,DWDP,"On the other hand, only 57 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 119 with lower revenues -- a ratio of 0.41. Put another way, only 28.9% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
1079,DWDP,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someones paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms.
"
1080,DWDP,"The strategy seems to be working, as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with six sectors seeing more than four increases for each cut, while only two sectors, Utilities and Aerospace, seeing more cuts than increases. Then again, there have been no reports yet for those two sectors.
"
1081,DWDP,"For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 2.48 -- its highest level in over a year and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.17 for next year.

"
1090,DWDP,"Massive positive surprises in cyclical Materials, Industrial and Discretionary sectors
"
1091,DWDP,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percent reported in mind; for some sectors the sample size is extremely small.  The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
1092,DWDP,"Also keep in mind that the consensus is generally tighter for defensive sectors like Staples and Medical than for cyclical sectors like Materials, thus a 8.96% median surprise for Staples might be more significant than a 12.71 median surprise for Discretionary. Both, however, are impressive.
"
1093,DWDP,"Overall, Tech appears to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front, with a 25:1 surprise ratio and a 7.69% median surprise, although strong arguments could be made for several other sectors. Some of the more impressive Tech earnings surprises include Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and SanDisk (SNDK).
"
1094,DWDP,"Basic Materials has had the biggest positive surprises, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX  -  Free Report) particularly impressive.

"
1136,DWDP,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase. On the other hand, the defensive Staples sector has a very high revisions ratio of 7.43, so it's not just the cyclicals.

1183,DWDP,"This weeks screen has something for both Growth Investors and Value Investors. 
"
1184,DWDP,"Growth Investors focus on companies with great earnings growth, but that alone isnt good enough for many stock pickers any more. They want good growth at reasonable prices (low P/Es). 
"
1185,DWDP,"And while Value Investors focus on low P/E stocks, too many are low because they lack earnings power. 
"
1186,DWDP,"So instead, try combining the best of both worlds and focus on the companies with the highest growth rates and the lowest P/E ratios. 
"
1187,DWDP,"The screen Im running this week is as follows: Companies with 5 Yr. Historical Growth Rates to be in the top 20 percentile of all companies. 
"
1188,DWDP,"(Using a Uniform Rank of 1-99 (99 being the best growth rates), I screened for stocks ranked 80 or better.) Companies that also happened to have the lowest P/Es  lower than 80% of all other companies.
"
1189,DWDP,"(Using a Uniform Rank of 1-99 again (this time 99 having the lowest P/Es), I screened for stocks ranked 80 or better.) I then required those stocks to be trading at or above $5, ... with average daily trading volumes of 100,000 shares or more.And a Zacks Rank of 2 or less.
"
1190,DWDP,"(Only buys and strong buys allowed).
"
1191,DWDP,"For the week of 10/23/06, there are 32 companies that passed this screen. Here are three from the list that look great:CCRT CompuCredit Corporation DOW Dow Chemical SAFC Safeco Corp.     
"
1192,DWDP,"Incidentally, this screen backtested very well too. And while it wasnt designed to be a trading strategy per se (20-25 stocks on average is a lot of stocks to trade every month), this screening strategy beat the market every year for the last five years (2001 through 2005). (I ran a series of tests over the last five-year time span using a four-week rebalancing period. Each run was rebalanced over a different set of four-week periods to eliminate coincidence and verify robustness.) 
"
1193,DWDP,"In 2001, this screen showed an average annualized gross return of 42.6%. In 2002, it was 19.1%. In 2003, it was a whopping 93%. In 2004, it came in at 40.4%. 2005 was up 11.9%. And so far in 2006 (YTD -- through 10/13/06), its average compounded gross return is up nearly 6%.  
"
1194,DWDP,"This screen is an excellent way to find good growth companies that also have low valuations.
