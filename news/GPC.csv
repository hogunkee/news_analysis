2,GPC,"In one sense, auto parts retailers got crushed in 2017's bull market for stocks. While the S&P 500 rose 19% for the year, O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) ended 2017 almost 14% below where it started.  AutoZone (AZO) fell 10%, and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) tanked 41%. But while the eight-stock group collectively fell 34% in the first half of the year,…

3,GPC,"With the stock market plunging and the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average plummeting to right above their 200-day moving averages, this is not a good time to make new purchases. But it's a good time to be looking for growth stocks to add to your watch list. In the IBD 50 list of top stocks, five are seen reporting faster earnings growth next quarter: Nvidia (NVDA), Alibaba (BABA), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Five Below (FIVE) and Paycom Software (PAYC).All five stocks have Composite Ratings above 95, meaning that they outperform more than 95% of all stocks based on key metrics, including earnings. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big runs. Paycom Software and Palo Alto Networks have best-possible 99 Composite Ratings. Alibaba has a 98 CR, followed by Five Below at 97 and Nvidia at 96.Alibaba is expected to report earnings per share growth of 49% for the current quarter after a 25% year-over-year gain in the latest quarter. The Chinese e-commerce giant actually missed December-quarter EPS estimates slightly as it spends heavily on cloud computing and other projects. But that's helped fuel huge revenue gains. Sales surged 66% in the latest quarter, the best in 15 quarters. That top-line growth is now seen putting the gas on the bottom line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlibaba has been working on a consolidation with a 206.30 buy point, but the stock tumbled 9.5% last week to 181.20, falling through its 50-day moving average. Blame the general stock market sell-off and a tumble by archrival Tencent (TCEHY), following its earnings report last week.Alibaba rose 5.1% to 190.50 on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day line as the major averages rallied on easing trade war fears.Nvdia earnings per share are expected to soar 84%, improving from last quarter's 59%, which barely slowed from the prior quarter's 60%.It's amazing that Nvidia could be accelerating earnings growth after such a long run of huge year-over-year growth. But the graphics-chip maker is benefiting from booming demand in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and more.Nvidia stock sank 7% last week to 232.97, dropping below its 50-day line on Friday.Its shares climbed 4.9% to 244.48 Monday, rebounding back above the 50-day.Nvidia holds its GPC Technology Conference this week, starting Monday, covering artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, augmented reality and more. CEO Jensen Huang will give a keynote address at 9 a.m. PT on Tuesday.Palo Alto Networks' EPS should ramp up from 37% in the latest quarter to 56%. Revenue growth nudged up to 28% in the latest quarter from 27%. Shares of the cybersecurity firm fell 3% to 181.76 last week, but that was better than the major stock market indexes. Palo Alto stock is well extended from a February breakout at 156.95.Palo Alto was up 3.2% to 187.55 Monday.The teen-focused retailer reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings last week, with EPS up 31% vs. a year earlier. Five Below guided current-quarter EPS estimates to 31-34 cents vs. the then-consensus of 23 cents. Not all analysts have yet revised their earnings estimates following the Q4 report and guidance. But if you take the midpoint of Five Below's target, 32.5 cents, then earnings should surge 117%. That's by far the strongest expected growth and biggest acceleration of the stocks cited here.Five Below rallied 4.2% on Thursday following earnings. The stock rose to 72.20 intraday Friday, briefly clearing a 71.69 cup-with-handle buy point. But with the S&P 500 index and stock market selling off, Five Below reversed to close down 1.3% to 69.03. The stock did manage to eke out a 0.1% weekly gain.Five Below popped 3.9% on Monday to 71.71, just above its 71.69 entry.Paycom Software earnings growth should pop to 91% from 61%. Paycom is one of several highly rated software companies specializing in payroll and human resources. Business software generally has been performing well.Its stock hit a record high on Wednesday, but closed the week down 3.2% to 106.79.Paycom jumped 6.6% to 113.87 on Monday.Ultimately, earnings are what drive stocks and the broader stock market higher. So while active investors should pay close attention to stock charts, you have to remember the fundamentals.But the fundamentals and technicals go hand in hand. It's not surprising that top stocks expected to accelerate profit growth should have relative strength lines at or near record highs. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, makes it easy to spot true stock market winners, vs. laggards. In a struggling stock market like this one, investors should look for growth names with RS lines at or near highs. These may be the stocks that lead the next rally. YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Facebook Still In Focus, Red Hat Earnings Due After Market Sell-OffThe Big Picture: Stock Market Faces Final TestThese 5 Hot Software Stocks Are Showing Strength Near HighsConsider These 3 Defense Giants For Your Stock ArsenalWhy Did These 4 IBD 50 Stocks Shine As Boeing, Alphabet Tumbled?

5,GPC,"Auto parts retailers such as AutoZone (AZO) and O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) have been gobbling up market share for years through acquisitions and by outflanking smaller, more local competitors.

8,GPC,"Forget the current banner year for new-car sales — auto parts retailers are forging ahead undaunted, benefitting from a host of favorable industry trends.
"
9,GPC,"Cheap gasoline prices, an increase in miles driven and an aging fleet of cars on the road have helped leading players such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) maintain decent growth.

10,GPC,"They've accomplished that even as vehicle sales are at their highest point in over a decade — something that normally would act as a headwind to the auto parts sector.
"
11,GPC,"Auto parts chains have also largely avoided competition from Amazon (AMZN).
"
12,GPC,"O'Reilly, the sector's biggest by market cap, has shown particular strength, with a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth. It extended that streak after Wednesday's close, logging a 28% year-over-year EPS gain and breezing past consensus views.

15,GPC,"Pep Boys Acquired
"
16,GPC,"The group is doing so well that even members considered to be laggards are attracting attention.
"
17,GPC,"Case in point: Monday's news that auto parts supplier Bridgestone will acquire Pep Boys — Manny, Moe & Jack (PBY) for about $835 million. Bridgestone will pay $15 a share in cash, a 23% premium over Pep Boys' Oct. 23 closing price. The deal is expected to close early in 2016.
"
18,GPC,"Bridgestone paid the premium even though Pep Boys has underperformed for most of this decade. The company's annual revenue has barely budged over the last three years, and it hasn't grown annual earnings since 2011. The fact that Pep Boys brought such a rich buyout offer says a lot about how much auto parts retailers are valued right now, analysts say.
"
19,GPC,"""It certainly signifies the health and strength of the industry when you see a company pay that much for Pep Boys, which historically has been a laggard in the industry,"" Sterne Agee CRT analyst Ali-Ahmad Faghri told IBD. Faghri follows several auto parts stocks, including O'Reilly and AutoZone, but not Pep Boys.
"
20,GPC,"The industry's strength is the result of several dynamics, analysts say. One is the average age of cars on U.S. roads: a record 11.5 years, according to research firm IHS Automotive. Older cars require more of the replacement parts, maintenance and repair work that auto parts retailers provide.
"
21,GPC,"The aging fleet has also put more vehicles on the road — a record 250 million, according to Bloomberg. More cars lead to higher demand for auto parts and services.
"
22,GPC,"Lower gas prices have been a boon as well. When consumers pay less for gas, they have an incentive to drive more, which increases demand for parts and services.
"
23,GPC,"""Miles driven has been a critical growth driver — we've seen a nice uptick there,"" Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck told IBD. ""Consumers are increasing their miles driven, which increases the wear and tear on cars.""
"
24,GPC,"Do-It-For-Me Fuels Retailers
"
25,GPC,"Meanwhile, a growing number of consumers are outsourcing maintenance and repair to auto parts retailers rather than doing it themselves. This Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) side of the business has provided an additional revenue stream for auto parts retailers, which used to rely almost exclusively on the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) market.
"
26,GPC,"""We continue to see growth in the Do-It-For-Me market, which has been a major growth driver for these companies,"" Fleck said.
"
27,GPC,"Finally, auto parts retailers — unlike most other retailers — have not been hurt by Amazon and other e-commerce sites. That's mainly because when someone needs an auto part, he or she doesn't like to wait around for it to arrive by mail.
"
28,GPC,"""Given the focus of service and speed, online retailers like Amazon haven't disrupted the auto parts retailers,"" Faghri said.
"
29,GPC,"These favorable trends have helped offset what is normally a headwind for auto parts retailers — rising vehicle sales.
"
30,GPC,"U.S. auto sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18.2 million in September, the highest rate in more than a decade.
"
31,GPC,"September was particularly strong because it included the full Labor Day weekend. Some experts expect the pace to slow in October, though the annual rate should still be the highest since before the Great Recession.
"
32,GPC,"Last week, auto industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive raised their forecasts for 2015 auto sales to 17.3 million vehicles from 17.2 million.
"
33,GPC,"And while more new cars on the road previously translated into less demand for replacement parts and maintenance services, previous conditions no longer prevail.
"
34,GPC,"One thing that's different these days: older cars aren't being sent to the graveyard just because their owners are buying new ones. Instead, owners are trading their old cars in or selling them.
"
35,GPC,"""You've seen this boom in new-car sales, and yet the average age (of cars) has continued to tick up,"" Fleck said. ""Cars last longer than they used to, so there's a secular shift going on there. There's still a growing need for auto parts as the age continues to rise, and that's a big positive.""Forget the current banner year for new-car sales — auto parts retailers are forging ahead undaunted, benefitting from a host of favorable industry trends.Cheap gasoline prices, an increase in miles driven and an aging fleet of cars on the road have helped leading players such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) maintain decent growth.They've accomplished that even as vehicle sales are at their highest point in over a decade — something that normally would act as a headwind to the auto parts sector.Auto parts chains have also largely avoided competition from Amazon (AMZN).O'Reilly, the sector's biggest by market cap, has shown particular strength, with a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth.

36,GPC,"Ok...so what happened last night? All that hype about the China macro data kept everyone on edge over the weekend...what would they report? Would it be a disaster? What would that say about the health of the Chinese economy and then by default the global economy? In the end - it was NOT a blockbuster, in fact it was rather boring really....
"
37,GPC,"At 10:00 pm est - China released a bunch of data - and it was mixed.....no disasters but no upside surprises either.........3rd Qtr GDP came in above expectations at 6.9% (exp was for 6.8%), Industrial Production did rise 5.7%, but that was below the exp of 6%. Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean? Well - to start with - the data implies that the world is not ending and that the Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing - which in the end is a positive.
"
38,GPC,"Angus Nicholson - Market Analyst at IG sums it up like this:
"
39,GPC,"""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Nonetheless, markets have clearly been buoyed by the better than expected headline number, and it shows that China's economy has not deteriorated as much as some had thought""
"
40,GPC,"James Laurenceson - Deputy Director of the Australia-China Relations Institute added that:
"
41,GPC,"""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""
"
42,GPC,"So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.
"
43,GPC,"Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.
"
44,GPC,"European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.
"
45,GPC,"France's Danone Group up 2.5% beat estimates, Germany's Deutsche Bank +3.1%, announces a big management shakeup and restructuring plan - heads to roll and that is helping to send other financials higher. German retailer Metro - announces a rise in sales and is talking all bullish about the coming Christmas season sending this stock up by 3.7%. Air France- KLM announces job CUTS in 2016 and investors love it - sending that stock higher.... and not to be left in the dark - Italian carmaker Ferrari is getting ready to price its IPO tomorrow and will start trading on the NYSE on Thursday.
"
46,GPC,"This morning US futures are off 1 pt.....Now prior to the China report - US futures were pointing lower on the expectation that we were gonna get hit hard....and when that did not happen - Futures moved to the plus side and are now flat. I suspect that the market will test resistance at 2040 and then back off trying to find support in the 2025 range - if not, then definitely the 1980 range.
"
47,GPC,"As much as there is plenty of US macro data this week - the focus will now return to US corp earnings. This week and next week will see hundreds of reports for investors to chew on. Earnings to include: HAS, MS, HAL, GPC, IBM, ZION, AXP, BA, KO, MCD, MSFT, and PG to name just a few.
"
48,GPC,"NOTE: Fed's Lacker is due to speak today at 12 pm.
"
49,GPC,"Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.
"
50,GPC,"Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?
"
51,GPC,"Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....
"
52,GPC,"The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?

Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean? Well - to start with - the data implies that the world is not ending and that the Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing - which in the end is a positive.Angus Nicholson - Market Analyst at IG sums it up like this:""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Nonetheless, markets have clearly been buoyed by the better than expected headline number, and it shows that China's economy has not deteriorated as much as some had thought""James Laurenceson - Deputy Director of the Australia-China Relations Institute added that:""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.France's Danone Group up 2.5% beat estimates, Germany's Deutsche Bank +3.1%, announces a big management shakeup and restructuring plan - heads to roll and that is helping to send other financials higher. German retailer Metro - announces a rise in sales and is talking all bullish about the coming Christmas season sending this stock up by 3.7%. Air France- KLM announces job CUTS in 2016 and investors love it - sending that stock higher.... and not to be left in the dark - Italian carmaker Ferrari is getting ready to price its IPO tomorrow and will start trading on the NYSE on Thursday.This morning US futures are off 1 pt.....Now prior to the China report - US futures were pointing lower on the expectation that we were gonna get hit hard....and when that did not happen - Futures moved to the plus side and are now flat. I suspect that the market will test resistance at 2040 and then back off trying to find support in the 2025 range - if not, then definitely the 1980 range.As much as there is plenty of US macro data this week - the focus will now return to US corp earnings. This week and next week will see hundreds of reports for investors to chew on. Earnings to include: HAS, MS, HAL, GPC, IBM, ZION, AXP, BA, KO, MCD, MSFT, and PG to name just a few.NOTE: Fed's Lacker is due to speak today at 12 pm.Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?Take good careKpYou can get better.

"
82,GPC,"Ever since Tim Sullivan agreed to sell his mining equipment company to construction-gear icon Caterpillar (CAT) in 2010, before the commodities crash, some on Wall Street have praised his sense of timing.Now, as the head of specialty-vehicle outfit REV Group (REVG), Wall Street is hoping he'll be able to correctly time a cycle of a different sort.In this instance, that cycle involves some massive shifts in the U.S. population and economy. Baby boomers are retiring. The nation is brushing away crisis-era residue. Its large cities have gotten bigger. So probably, analysts say, the country is going to need a company like REV Group — which sells firetrucks, ambulances, buses, RVs and special-assistance vehicles — to help transport the nation's urbanized, distressed, adventurous, graying population. ""I hate to say it, but as the population ages, we all probably need a few more ambulances around,"" Jefferies analyst Steven Volkmann said.Those population permutations play a big role in REV's business. REV Group is the market-share leader in the ambulance business, and the runner-up in fire apparatus — that is, the vehicles and equipment used to put out fires.Further, Brookdale Senior Living (BKD), the nation's largest operator of senior-living communities, buys REV Group's shuttle buses and is counted among the company's biggest customers.Regardless of changing demographics, though, buses, ambulances and firetrucks are also due for a huge round of upgrades put off by towns, cities and contractors during the recession. As a result, some analysts expect the company to nearly double its yearly earnings per share by 2019.Some of those trends may already be bearing out. While REV Group reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, the company's first since going public in January, Sullivan cited ""strong macro and demographic tailwinds"" and ""pent-up demand that is driving our customers to replace their aging fleets.""When new vehicles from the company aren't needed, REV Group hopes to balance out the downtime by diving more into its aftermarket parts business.In that area, the company sees an $800-million-a-year opportunity where it only pulled in around $74 million in fiscal 2016, and a chance to compete with Genuine Parts (GPC)-owned NAPA Auto Parts and AutoZone (AZO).The company last year launched an online site to buy parts. Analysts like the potential flexibility afforded by REV's aftermarket-parts segment, as well as other aspects of the company.In specialty vehicles, Volkmann explained, a company typically buys the chassis from a company like Ford (F) or General Motors (GM) and then attaches their firetruck, camper, ambulance or bus cabin to it.""At the end of the day, they make boxes and put them on the back of other peoples' chassis,"" he said. ""So that means that the capital tied up in this process is fairly minimal.""REV Group's sales break down into three main segments. The largest in fiscal 2016 was fire and emergency equipment, followed by commercial, and then recreation.Recreational vehicles are seen as having the most room to grow as boomers retire into an improving economy.""People who tend to get into the RV market tend to stay in the RV market,"" said Sandy Bugbee, VP, treasurer and investor relations at the company.REV Group was stitched together through acquisitions made by its private-equity owner, American Industrial Partners, and has built its market share by gobbling up other specialty-vehicle makers.That market has been characterized by a scattering of small, loosely related companies — from street sweepers to RVs designed for the racing and motor sports scene. That means there's plenty of opportunity to pack on acquisitions — more than 100 potentially, according to a Baird research note.The businesses REV buys up gain the resources of a larger firm, including wider access to dealers and more muscle to negotiate on prices, the company argues.Since the companies that REV buys are enough alike, it has the opportunity to raise the standards for quality across the board, Stifel analyst Michael Baudendistel said.That's not always the case, however. With KME, a 70-year-old family-owned firetruck maker that REV acquired in April, REV has tried to cut the number of facilities that KME uses and tighten up quality assurance. But the company is still working to shore up KME's margins. There also are instances where REV still is working to straighten out acquisitions that are several years old. It could take time before REV Group's RV business — including one-time industry icon Fleetwood, parts of which were picked up in a 2009 bankruptcy sale — starts to pay off.Bugbee said that the process of overhauling parts of the RV business were ""a true mess,"" with some vehicles coming off the line in subpar condition before the company brought in new standards and management. Efforts to clean up the segment also might not be immediately apparent to consumers if they buy an RV made before the improvements, but which sat in a dealer's lot. REV could also suffer short-term if more customers claim warranties on those vehicles. IBD'S TAKE: REV Group is part of IBD's Mobile Home Manufacturing and RV Group, and ranks fourth, roughly in the middle of the pack. The top-ranked company is Cavco Industries (CVCO), and more on that company can be found here.""You don't want to go out and tell people we've put garbage on the streets, right?"" Bugbee said. ""But it was a different management team.""That's a potential drawback of the company's strategy of, as it says, buying good companies on bad days.In a note to clients, Stifel's Baudendistel wrote that ""when the company purchases brands at a discount, we believe they are usually cheap for a reason,"" adding that consumer perceptions of a company can be slow to change, particularly if what the company sells is subpar.Another cautionary note is that American Industrial Partners still owns some 70% of REV. Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Casey, in a research note, said that ""could be an overhang on the shares,"" given that AIP will still hold ""substantial control over corporate actions irrespective of how other shareholders vote"".Bugbee said AIP would cut the company loose within the next two to three years. But the stock is currently in an IPO base, with a decent Composite Rating of 80, and, as is typical with IPOs, Wall Street could be cautious until the company gets a few more quarters behind them.REV during its earnings call said the integration of KME was ""on schedule."" But Baudendistel worries that management's attention could be pulled in different directions.""It's hard to be in all those places,"" he said.Growth in big-city populations also cooled in 2015, Census data last year showed, and the company's fortunes also hinge on state and local spending at a time when a majority of states are controlled by Republicans. Bugbee said the company hadn't seen any pullback in spending.With President Trump's election comes the prospect of broad infrastructure investment. Some analysts say that could benefit the company. But others downplayed the potential benefit, as did Bugbee, citing the smaller size of REV's street-sweeper business.If Trump and the GOP Congress heave away regulations and the economy speeds up, the higher interest rates that might result could deter loans for RVs, Volkmann suggested. However, the company has little business abroad.""So if you're going to buy U.S. and hire U.S.,"" Volkmann said, ""then this is a U.S. company.""REV shares have been choppy since the company's IPO in January, but generally are trending up. Shares climbed 2.9% to close at 27.27 on Friday.

84,GPC,"Stocks opened with minor losses Tuesday, despite a strong read on June housing activity.Dow industrials fell 0.1% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq eased 0.2%.Some big earnings reports rolled out late Monday and early Tuesday, led by Netflix (NFLX), Goldman Sachs (GS), IBM (IBM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The stock market is so far enjoying a healthy July. The Nasdaq is up 4.4% for the month through Monday, its best performance since October. The S&P 500's 3.2% gain is its strongest since March. Among small caps, the Russell 2000 has a 4.9% gain for the month -- also its best since March. If the market pauses or pulls back, however, a few telling factors could clue in investors to where institutional investors might be headed next.The Commerce Department said June housing starts rose almost 5%, to an annualized rate of 1.189 million vs. a 1.135 million tally for May that was revised downward.  Economists had projected a rate of 1.17 million.Building permits, a guide to future activity, rose more than 1% to 1.153 million on an annualized basis.

Earnings growth blew past analyst expectations, while revenue met estimates.

Pressure on oil prices worked against stocks in the first moments of trading but investors/traders and the big banks ended up ignoring the news out of Doha in a move that surprised many.Mkts around the world are all celebrating today...taking their cue from the turnaround in US equities....US futures are rocketing higher - currently up 11 pts as we kiss the psychological 2100 level.....but as my friend Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) tells me on twitter this morning""The first kiss us usually meets some opposition, then the romance gets you around the bases"" - to which I say - Yes, but it is the first kiss that is the sweetest which makes you want to go back for more.....and more is what it looks like we are gonna get today.....Remember - the mkt is a discounting mechanism....it is looking 4 - 6 months out....the trading today is not about today.....(Just sayin.....) - it is really about what the mkts expect in the fall......and by the looks of it - the mkt is expecting great things...Asian mkts were all higher overnight - Japan which got clobbered on Monday - snapped back and regained 100% of Monday's losses.....as we saw the Yen weaken a bit....a stabilizing oil mkt is also helping to support mkts today....After yesterday's mkt action - it appears that investors are disconnecting from the whims of the oil mkt....at least for now and concentrating on earnings.....European mkts are also enjoying an explosive rally....because why? Earnings and oil......and the sense is that maybe - the whole Mid-East OPEC summit was all hype.....to confuse the conversation.....interesting that the possibility of increased production has caused oil to stabilize and rally a bit from the Monday lows.....Does it feel like something else is going on? FTSE +0.56%, CAC 40 + 1.21%, DAX + 2.22%, EUROSTOXX +1.58%, SPAIN +0.88% and ITALY + 0.57%.Now just a thought or two about yesterday.....and the role that the Deputy Crown Prince is now playing......Look the big story was OIL and POLITICS – Mid East politics – and after two months of all the hype about this pending agreement in a production freeze – traders and the mkts had to deal with the fact that there was no deal – which now sets up the oil mkt for a possible 'free for all'….Keep your eyes on Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – for he is now the name to know – for it was this 30 yr old son of King Salman who has now turned over the apple cart and merged the commercial considerations of the kingdom with his political stance – a move that is in complete contrast to what was existing policy.......You see for the past 20 yrs – Ali Al-Naimi – the current Saudi oil minister has kept those two issues on separate pages – keeping supply and pricing as the main drivers of any production decisions, always cooperating with the other members – including Iran – no matter what their politics were – in the past to cut production to boost oil prices. The Deputy Crown Prince is not sure he agrees with this policy and so while all the talk has been about how the Saudi's were cooperating with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar – Iran was still the thorn in Prince Mohammed's side….so in a bid to establish himself as an emerging 'force' - as the potential heir to the throne - he nixed the oil deal sending oil mkts into a tailspin on Sunday night/Monday.What is important to understand is that the deputy Crown Prince has now burst onto the global stage since his father became King last year and appears to have every intention of letting the world know. He was appointed the Defense Minister – and is the one responsible for launching the latest military campaign in Yemen while also chairing the country's 'economic planning body' and the council that controls the massive 'state owned' oil company. In a telling interview last week with Bloomberg – the Prince was very clear –""We don't care about oil prices, $30 or $70, they are the same to us. We have our own programs that don't need high oil prices.""This is not how the rest of the OPEC and non OPEC members feel at all – so by nixing any deal he has protected the Saudi's mkt share, and has secured their role as a 'leader' while at the same time laying the groundwork for continued political instability in the region.OK - back to the mkts.....After the initial concerns over these recent developments – the focus returned to US earnings…the day started off with better numbers from Pepsico (PEP), Hasbro (HAS), JB Hunt (JBHT) and in a another surprise move – we learned that Morgan Stanley (MS) – while reporting horrible numbers did in fact ""beat all the estimates."" Net Income FELL 54%, Equity trading revenues FELL 34%, Fixed Income trading revenues FELL 52% and Investment Banking Revenues FELL 15% - but yet they somehow managed to beat the 'much lower' EPS expectation….so all this means is that we must watch out for Goldman Sachs (GS) report this morning.....Analysts expect EPS of $2.48......Now remember – Uncle Lloyd pre-announced this 're-structuring' plan late on Friday – so investors/traders have been prepped about all the bad news and how he has dealt with it head on…. – and like Cousin Jamie (Dimon) of JP Morgan (JPM)– Uncle Lloyd knows how to 'massage' the street analysts – so what I expect to hear this morning is a 'BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF EPS' beat to rival even the most generous estimate….and the clock ticks towards 7:30 am......In other news - United Health (UNH) just reported a better number - $1.81 vs. exp of $1.72, Philip Morris (PM) on the other hand missed - $0.98 vs. exp of $1.10..... Watch for Brinker (EAT), Comerica (CMA), Genuine Parts (GPC), Harley Davidson (HDI), Kansas City Southern (KSU),Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Take Good Care

99,GPC,"If you ever need proof of how traditional market forces can get turned upside down, look no further than the auto parts retail sector, where leaders like O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) continue to churn out strong financial and share price growth despite what would normally be a big threat to business.Normally, one would think auto parts retailers would worry in the wake of last year's robust market for new car sales. In the past, a rise in new car sales would have been bad news for the aftermarket auto parts business. New cars require less maintenance and repair work than older ones, meaning there is less demand for the kind of parts and services supplied by O’Reilly, as well as rivals such as AutoZone (AZO), Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and Genuine Parts (GPC).But that dynamic no longer applies, analysts say.""The kinds of things that benefit new vehicle sales -- an improving economy, improving employment, higher income -- also benefit the auto parts sector,"" CRT Capital Group analyst Ali Faghri told IBD.The figures might seem daunting. In 2015, the U.S. auto industry posted sales of 17.5 million light vehicles, according to the Automotive News Data Center, breaking the previous record of 17.4 million set in 2000 and marking a 5.7% increase from 2014.But a rise in new car sales doesn’t necessarily mean older cars end up at the junkyard. Thanks to advances in technology, cars last much longer nowadays.So when someone buys a new car, chances are his old car will be resold instead of junked. It’s not unusual for vehicles with 120,000 miles or more to make their way onto used car lots.This trend has led to an ever-aging fleet of cars in the U.S. The average age of cars on the road is a record 11.5 years, according to industry researcher IHS Automotive. That figure is expected to creep up to 11.6 years in 2016.The obvious benefit to auto parts retailers is that as cars get older, they require more replacement parts, as well as repair and maintenance services. This feeds demand for the industry’s Do-It-Yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics; as well as the ""Do-It-For-Me"" segment that targets professional technicians and installers.The sector has also gotten a lift from the improving economy and job market, which have given many consumers more cash to spend on replacement parts and repairs.Meanwhile, O’Reilly and its peers have benefited from lower gasoline prices, which encourage people to drive more.""Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled -- leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales -- and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,"" Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a research report to clients.It all adds up to a robust market for O’Reilly. The company’s stock price trades near 269 and has been creeping back up toward the high of 277.96 set in late October. Shares have risen about 6% since the beginning of the year.Financially, O’Reilly is in the midst of a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth, helped by a stock repurchase program that began more than four years ago. Revenue has risen in double digits the last four quarters.The company earned $2.19 a share during the 2015 fourth quarter. That was up 24% from the prior year and well above consensus estimates. Revenue gained 10% to $1.95 billion, slightly above views. Comparable-store sales increased 7.7% vs. a 6.3% rise during the third quarter.""Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable-store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher,"" O’Reilly Chief Executive Greg Henslee said on a conference call with analysts. ""For 2016, we expect to see positive tailwinds from continued modest improvements in total employment and low gas prices.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O’Reilly to grow full-year EPS 16% in 2016 and another 13% in 2017.For all of 2015, O’Reilly’s comparable-store sales rose 7.5% -- the biggest annual gain since it grew comps 8.8% in 2010. O’Reilly opened 209 stores in 2015, bringing the total store count to 4,571 at year's end. It plans to open another 210 stores this year.""DIY market share gains have accelerated, and this is adding a new leg to same store-sales growth, which could lead to earnings upside,"" JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a report.Many of those market share gains have come at the expense of Advance Auto, he says, especially in East Coast markets.Because the fourth quarter includes parts of the winter season -- when cars tend to undergo more wear and tear -- O’Reilly and other parts retailers benefit when the weather is severe. That wasn’t the case during much of the 2015 fourth quarter, however.""While O’Reilly noted that its retail business suffered slightly in November due to abnormally warm weather, pressuring demand for products like anti-freeze, it successfully captured this demand in December as temperatures fell,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli noted in a report. ""Management believes winter weather has been fairly neutral to its business.""
"
100,GPC,"AutoZone (AZO) topped quarterly earnings views early Tuesday and delivered another solid same-store sales gain as the No. 1 U.S. auto parts retailer benefited from upbeat industry trends and higher margins.Reporting before the open, AutoZone earned $7.43 a share for its fiscal second quarter, which ended in February. That was up 14% from the prior year and comfortably above consensus analyst estimates for $7.28.Net sales rose 5% to $2.26 billion, matching views. Same-store sales climbed 3.6% from a year earlier after rising 3.5% during the first quarter.Gross profit as a percentage of sales widened to 52.7% from 52.2% the prior year, driven by higher merchandise margins.AutoZone shares closed up 2.1% on the stock market today.The company continues to benefit from strength in the auto parts industry’s do-it-yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics. That segment has gotten a leg up from several favorable trends -- including lower gasoline prices and an aging fleet of cars on the road -- and helped boost business at rivals such as O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY).“Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled (leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales) and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,” Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a recent report.More than 80% of AutoZone’s sales are to consumers rather than professional mechanics, he says, making it the “best positioned to take advantage of the relative strength in the DIY segment.""AutoZone also has gotten a lift from a new “mega hub” distribution strategy designed to improve inventory coverage through increased shipping frequency from its distribution centers to its retail stores.The company continues to roll out the strategy to more stores. About 1,300 of its 5,200 U.S. stores were serviced by the new strategy at the end of Q2, with about 2,000 stores expected to be serviced by the end of the fiscal year.“Our results to date continue to meet or exceed our expectations, further confirming our new inventory deployment strategy,” AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes said in a statement. “While we continue to strategically invest in our business in order to support our growth, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively.”While AutoZone and O’Reilly continue to pump out robust revenue and earnings growth, other auto parts retailers have seen a recent slowdown in business.Advance Auto Parts (AAP) reported lower sales and earnings during its 2015 fourth quarter -- the first time in more than three years that both metrics dipped during a single quarter.Meanwhile, Genuine Parts (GPC) has logged three straight quarters of flat earnings and two straight quarters of lower revenue.

Shares have added about 5.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is GPC due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Genuine Parts Q1 Earnings Miss, Revenues Top EstimatesGenuine Parts reported adjusted earnings of $1.27 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32. Adjusted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter were $1.08.The company recorded net income of $176.6 million in first-quarter 2018, up from $160.2 million in the prior-year quarter.Genuine Parts reported net sales of $4.59 billion, up 17% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.5 billion. The rise was driven by its global automotive and industrial businesses. Total sales included 2% organic growth, 14% from acquisitions -- including AAG-- and 1% benefit from foreign currency translation.Operating profit increased to $318.5 million from $286.9 million in first-quarter 2017. Selling, administrative and other expenses rose to $1.1 billion from $874 million a year ago.Segment ResultsRevenues from the Automotive group’s net sales improved 29.6% to $2.6 billion from the year-ago figure of $2 billion. Moreover, the group’s operating profit rose to $184.7 million in the reported quarter from $151.8 million a year ago.Effective Jan 1, 2018, the company’s Electrical/electronic material segment became a division of the Industrial segment. Further, results of both the segments were reported under the Industrial Parts Group. The Industrial Parts group’s net sales rose 8.3% year over year to $1.55 billion. Operating profit, however, increased to $112 million from $104 million in the year-ago quarter.The S. P. Richards or Business Products group’s net sales declined 4.8% to $474 million. Operating profit at the segment declined to $21.6 million from $31.1 million, recorded in the prior-year quarter.Financial PositionGenuine Parts had cash and cash equivalents of $326 million as of Mar 31, 2018, up from $178 million as of Mar 31, 2017.

There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared with two lower.Genuine Parts Company Price and Consensus  Genuine Parts Company Price and Consensus | Genuine Parts Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, GPC has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a C. The stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for growth investors than those looking for value and momentum.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise GPC has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.
"
155,GPC,"Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for GPC broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 1.4% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for GPC stock.If that wasn’t enough, GPC isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 3 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for GPC.

158,GPC,"Somewhat easing the tension of a trade war, China announced that it will erase the limit on foreign ownership of domestic auto ventures. This will assist foreign automakers to own factories in the country. Notably, this restriction has been in place since 1994, which limits foreign carmakers to own not more than 50% share of any local establishment.China will lift foreign ownership limit for the wider car market by 2022. This may open up opportunities for U.S. automakers and enable them to earn higher profits. But disentangling the network of collaborations forged with local Chinese companies may not be easy.The past week also saw General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) announcing layoffs of around 1,500 workers at its plant in Lordstown, OH, per CNBC. The auto giant took such a decision due to the dramatically slowing demand for compact cars.(Read the previous roundup here: Auto Stock Roundup for Apr 12, 2018)Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Per Reuters, Volkswagen AG’s (VLKAY  -  Free Report) Truck & Bus GmbH unit agreed to form a strategic alliance with Hino Motors, Ltd., a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report), to develop self-driving capabilities and lower-emission vehicles.Intended to strengthen their market position as commercial-vehicle manufacturers, the two automakers will join forces to deal with rising investment costs related to the development of autonomous vehicles and new transportation services, including ride sharing.The combined forces will work on research and development, technology and procurement of gasoline-electric and diesel hybrid engines as well as self-driving technologies. This will enable both the companies to benefit from the economies of scale and come up with innovative products at a faster pace compared with the time required while working separately.However, the partnership between the two subsidiary units will not change the competitive dynamics between Volkswagen and Toyota in the passenger-car market.

Richards. Thereafter, the S.P. Richards business and Essendant will be combined to create a new entity named Essendant. The newly formed unit will be headed by Essendant’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ric Phillips. Rick Toppin, CEO of S.P. Richards, will be the chief operating officer of the new entity. The combination of Essendant and S.P. Richards will result in a more competitive business products distributor with higher scale and service capabilities along with greater ability to support customers.The deal is structured as a Reverse Morris Trust. The transaction values S.P. Richards at approximately $680 million. Atlanta, GA-based Genuine Parts will receive $347 million in cash while the shareholders of the company will own around 51% of the combined company, post closing. The deal is slated to close before the end of 2018. However, it is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals, and satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions.Notably, Essendant is a wholesale distributor of workplace items whereas S.P. Richards distributes a range of products, including office furniture, computer supplies and school supplies, to resellers in the United States and Canada. (Read more: Genuine Parts’ S.P.

The auto giant took such a decision due to the dramatically slowing demand for compact cars. Notably, the plant only manufactures the Chevy Cruze model and employs around 3,000 workers.In fact, the demand for sedans has declined steeply in recent times. This year, car sales have declined 13.2% while that of SUVs, crossovers and pickups rose 7%. For Chevy Cruze, the sales decline has been steeper. Per Autodata, Chevy Cruze sales plunged 28% in 2018. In 2017, over 184,000 Cruze models were sold in the United States compared with 273,000 vehicles in 2013.The facility will be slowing the assembly lines by eliminating one of the two shifts, starting from mid-June. General Motors informed that up to 1,500 workers could be impacted by the decision.

(TSLA  -  Free Report) set a target to manufacture 6,000 Model 3 cars each week by the end of June to meet its weekly target of 5,000 Model 3 units by the end of second-quarter 2018, per Bloomberg. The difference includes a margin for error of the product parts. The news was first tracked by Electrek from an email by the company’s CEO to the employees.At the beginning of the month, Tesla reported unit productions for the first quarter of 2018. The company manufactured 2,020 Model 3 vehicles per week in the first quarter, thus lagging the target of manufacturing 2,500 Model 3 units per week.

159,GPC,"The first-quarter 2018 earnings season for the auto sector is knocking on the door. Two important companies that expect to come up with their results on Apr 19 are Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) and WABCO Holdings Inc. (WBC  -  Free Report).Per the latest Earnings Outlook, as of Apr 11, 24 companies from the S&P 500 category have already announced their results. These companies, as a whole, recorded earnings and revenue beat ratios of 75% and 70.8%, respectively. As of that date, no companies from the auto sector reported first-quarter 2018 results.However, first-quarter 2018 earnings and revenue growth for auto companies are expected to be in the negative territory. Auto stocks are expected to register 9.8% and 3.5% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, during the quarter, the S&P 500 companies are anticipated to record 16% and 7.4% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively.In fact, the auto sector, which is grappled with several problems, reported good sales results in March 2018. After a slow start in 2018, major automakers reported robust sales in March. A strong job market and tax reforms drove consumer demand, which in turn aided sales.In March, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) reported a year-over-year sales increase to 296,341 vehicles. This was attributable to Chevrolet, GMC, Buick and Cadillac brands, each reporting an increase of 15.6%, 11.4%, 28% and 12.7%, respectively. Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) announced a 3.5% increase in year-over-year sales to 244,306 vehicles, boosted by crossover and truck sales. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) reported 13.6% growth in year-over-year sales to 216,063 vehicles in the United States.Currently, Fiat Chrysler sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while both General Motors and Ford carry Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Our model does not conclusively predict that the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise as it has an Earnings ESP of -0.38% and a Zacks Rank #3.

160,GPC,"Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 19.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 0.9%. Over the trailing four quarters, it topped estimates twice, while missing the same in the other two, with an average surprise of a negative of 1.79%.Shares of Genuine Parts have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the last three months. The stock has lost 13.5% compared with the industry’s 10.3% decline. Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise  Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise | Genuine Parts Company Quote Let’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterThe company regularly undertakes acquisitions to expand the business. In November 2017, Genuine Parts completed the acquisition of Alliance Automotive Group (""AAG""), the second largest parts distribution platform in Europe. This assisted the company to expand footprint in the European markets. This has also aided it to raise future expectations. The to-be-reported quarterly results are likely to be positively impacted by the contribution from AAG's operations.Further, to boost top-and bottom-line growth, the company is focusing to expand the product line to penetrate new markets.However, rising cost of labor and delivery, as well as ongoing planned IT spending, is resulting in a continuous rise of its Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses that are hampering the gross margin figure.Also, the company’s long-term debt increased to $2.6 billion in 2017 in comparison with $550 million in the prior year. High debt means that a huge share of Genuine Parts earnings will be given to the debt holders as interest, thereby lowering contributions for shareholders.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Genuine Parts is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Genuine Parts has an Earnings ESP of -0.38% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.31 and $1.32, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Genuine Parts carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, this combined with its Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few auto stocks worth considering, comprising the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this time around:Cummins Inc.

But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of -2.97% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.09 and $1.12, respectively.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PACCAR carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few auto stocks worth considering from the same space as these have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:BorgWarner, Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company’s fourth-quarter 2017 financial results are expected to be released on Feb 8.

184,GPC,"The second-quarter 2017 earnings season for the auto sector is knocking on the door. Two important companies expected to come up with their results on Jul 20 are Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) and WABCO Holdings Inc. (WBC  -  Free Report).Per the latest Earnings Outlook, as of Jul 12, 25 companies from the S&P 500 category have already announced their results. These companies, as a whole, recorded earnings and revenues beat ratios of 84% and 88%, respectively. As of that date, no companies from the auto sector have reported second-quarter 2017 results.However, second-quarter 2017 earnings and revenue growth for auto companies are expected to be in the negative territory. Auto stocks are expected to register 10.2% and 0.7% year-over-year decline in earnings and revenues, respectively. However, the S&P 500 companies, as a whole, are anticipated to record 5.6% and 4.5% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively, during the quarter.In fact, the auto sector is facing a lot of challenges. The joy-ride of 2016 (record year for new vehicle sales in the U.S.) is not likely to continue in 2017, as the industry is facing the problems of high level of inventory.Auto major General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) lowered the outlook for new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2017. This is an indication of the industry heading for a moderate downturn in 2017. A glut in nearly-new used vehicles is expected to undermine sales this year. This has already started affecting the top line of many automakers.Also, safety recalls and related cost have become an alarming issue for majority of manufacturers in recent times. This has adversely affected many automakers including Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) and Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report).That said, let’s take a look at the two auto companies scheduled to announce their results tomorrow.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of a beat this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks.Atlanta, GA-based Genuine Parts is engaged in distributing automotive and industrial replacement parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Our model does not conclusively predict that the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise as it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.

185,GPC,"Investors with an interest in Automotive - Replacement Parts stocks have likely encountered both LKQ (LKQ  -  Free Report) and Genuine Parts (GPC  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, LKQ is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Genuine Parts has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that LKQ has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.LKQ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.15, while GPC has a forward P/E of 16.19. We also note that LKQ has a PEG ratio of 0.94. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. GPC currently has a PEG ratio of 2.44.Another notable valuation metric for LKQ is its P/B ratio of 2.25. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, GPC has a P/B of 3.77.These metrics, and several others, help LKQ earn a Value grade of B, while GPC has been given a Value grade of C.LKQ stands above GPC thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that LKQ is the superior value option right now.

However, during the first quarter, the S&P 500 companies are anticipated to record 20% and 8% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively.In fact, the auto sector, which grappled with several problems, reported good sales in March 2018. After a slow start in 2018, major automakers reported robust sales in March. A strong job market and tax reforms drove consumer demand, which in turn aided sales.In Europe, automakers are witnessing a decline in vehicle sales. Per European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, vehicle registrations edged down 0.6% in first-quarter 2018. This decline is majorly due to slowing economic growth and uncertain trading regulations.That said, let’s take a look at the three auto companies, which are scheduled to announce their results tomorrow.We relied on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank — #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP to predict chances of a beat this quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

189,GPC,"The Auto sector has been seeing a slew of first-quarter 2018 earnings releases of late. Many of the bigwigs are slated to release results for the quarter ending Mar 31, 2018, by the end of this week. On Apr 19, Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) and WABCO Holdings Inc. (WBC  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter earnings. WABCO reported earnings beat for the quarter, while Genuine Parts missed the estimate.Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 companies under the S&P 500 category have reported results. These companies’ beat ratios were 82.8% and 67.8% for earnings and revenues, respectively.For first-quarter 2018, earnings for auto companies are expected to decline 9.6% on a year-over-year basis and revenues are likely to fall 3.4%. However, the S&P 500 companies are likely to see 18.3% and 7.7% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively, in the quarter.In March, the automakers made a comeback after seeing declining U.S. sales in February 2018. An improved economy, product launches and customer discounts have helped auto companies witness a year-over-year rise in new vehicle sales. This uptick has encouraged automakers to introduce improved SUV and pick-up truck models under various brands, each catering to specific customer requirements. Further, a number of major auto companies have announced newer models which are expected to hit the showrooms in 2019.Meanwhile, in the world’s largest automotive market China, auto sales rose 4.7% year over year to 2.66 million units in March after an 11% drop in February 2018. Per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, first-quarter vehicles sales rose 2.8% on a year-over-year basis to around 7.2 million units.Now, let’s take a closer look at two big names in the auto industry — Harley-Davidson, Inc.

190,GPC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Genuine Parts has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.6. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Genuine Parts’ current PE level puts it slightly below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 19.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Genuine Parts has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 15.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Genuine Parts stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Genuine Parts has a P/S ratio of about 0.8. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, GPC is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Genuine Parts currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Genuine Parts a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Genuine Parts might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives GPC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen three upward and two downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 6.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has decreased 18.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Genuine Parts Company Price and Consensus  Genuine Parts Company Price and Consensus | Genuine Parts Company QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineGenuine Parts is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 39% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

199,GPC,"Genuine Parts Company (GPC  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 21.Last quarter, the company delivered a negative surprise of 9.4%. In the trailing four quarters, it beat and missed estimates twice, leading to an average earnings miss of 1.8%.Shares of Genuine Parts have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the last three months. The stock has gained 17.4%, compared with the industry’s 10.1% rally.Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise Genuine Parts Company Price and EPS Surprise | Genuine Parts Company QuoteLet’s see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Factors Influencing This QuarterIn fiscal 2017, Genuine Parts anticipates its annual sales growth rate in the range of 4-4.5%, while adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis is anticipated to be in the range of $4.55-$4.6.The company frequently undertakes acquisitions to expand its business. In November 2017, it completed the acquisition of Europe's Alliance Automotive Group (AAG) for a total price of roughly $2 billion. The acquisition will enable Genuine Parts to enter the European market through AAG’s large chain of stores and its geographical presence across the continent.Further, to boost top and bottom-line growth, the company is focusing to expand its product line to penetrate new markets.However, the company’s rising Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, due to rising cost of labor and delivery as well as ongoing planned IT spending, are hampering its profit margins. Also, its high proportion of inventory might affect the short-term liquidity of the company during low sales.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of the Automotive segment is pegged at $2.21 billion, up from the third quarter’s actual total revenues of $2.17 billion.Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of the company’s Industrial segment is pegged at $1.18 billion, up from the third quarter’s actual figure of $1.24 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of Office Products segment stands at $473 million, up from the third quarter’s actual net sales of $510 million. While the same for net sales in the Electrical/Electronic Materials segment is pegged at $190 million, down from the third quarter’s actual net sales of $199 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Genuine Parts is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Genuine Parts has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.09. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Genuine Parts carries a Zacks Rank of 2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, this combined with its Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few auto stocks worth considering from the same space, comprising the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:Magna International, Inc.

200,GPC,"Daimler AG (DDAIF  -  Free Report) has rung the warning bell that its shifting focus to electric vehicles (EVs) could compel it to support its supply chain, per a Reuters report.

However, due to the intense competition, the ability of the company to pass on the higher expenses of commodities and other materials to the price of end vehicle is limited.Over the past year, shares of this company have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

Additionally, the company’s board has approved a hike in quarterly cash dividend to 26 cents per share from the earlier payout of 25 cents. This revised dividend was paid on Jan 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Dec 18, 2017.However, divesting its multiple businesses is adversely impacting the company’s profits and revenues. Notably, in October 2017, the company closed the divestiture of Scott Safety to 3M. Prior to this, in March 2017, the company had also completed the divestiture of its ADT South Africa business. Thus, these high separation costs associated with the divestitures are straining its revenues and profits.Johnson Controls is also vulnerable to volatility in commodity prices.

But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Johnson Controls has an Earnings ESP is +2.76% because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 53 cents and 51 cents, respectively. A positive ESP always indicates a likely positive earnings surprise.
